{
  "purpose": "Custom setup script for Python package that includes conditional execution of code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports modules, and executes decrypted code within the install method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code using exec() which could run arbitrary code, especially since the decrypted payload is not revealed.",
  "flows": "The install class's method decrypts a base64-encoded string and executes it if OS is Windows; this is triggered during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted code that is decrypted and executed during install; obfuscated variable names; hardcoded encrypted payload; conditional code execution based on OS; use of exec() on decrypted content.",
  "analysis": "The script defines obfuscated variables and a custom install class. During installation on Windows, it decrypts an embedded encrypted string and executes it via exec(). This encrypted payload may contain malicious code, as it is executed dynamically without transparency. The code also imports potentially unnecessary modules like 'requests' and 'fernet' as setup requirements, which could be used maliciously if the decrypted code is harmful. The rest of the setup configuration appears standard but is overshadowed by the malicious-looking encrypted code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious, obfuscated dynamic code execution that could execute malicious code during installation on Windows systems. The use of encrypted payloads and exec() indicates potential malicious intent, representing a security risk. This package should be considered unsafe to use without further inspection of the decrypted payload.",
