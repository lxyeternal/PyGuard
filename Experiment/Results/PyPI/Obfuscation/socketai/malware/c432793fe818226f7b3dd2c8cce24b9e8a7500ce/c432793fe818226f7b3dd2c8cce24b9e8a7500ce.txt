      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through runtime decryption and execution of an embedded payload, with obfuscation and conditional targeting of Windows systems. The high scores assigned are justified, indicating a high probability of malicious activity. The package should be considered highly suspicious or malicious, and further analysis of the decrypted payload is recommended for confirmation."
