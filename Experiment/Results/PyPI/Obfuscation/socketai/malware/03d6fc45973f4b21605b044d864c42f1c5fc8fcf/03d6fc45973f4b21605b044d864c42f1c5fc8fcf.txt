      "conclusion": "The script functions as a standard setup configuration with obfuscation and dynamic execution. There are no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The primary concern is the use of exec() on external files, which should be validated, but this is common in setup scripts. Malware score is 0, risk score is moderate (~0.3), and obfuscation is high (~0.6), aligning with the observed code complexity and naming."

The obfuscation and dynamic code execution are classic indicators of malware, warranting high malware and security risk scores."

While the obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or system compromise. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate; caution is advised due to obfuscation, but no active malicious intent is demonstrated."

No active malicious activity is evident, but obfuscation raises suspicion. The overall security risk is low, with a low malware score, but the obfuscation score remains high. Further review of unobfuscated source code is recommended before deployment."

The scores assigned are consistent with these findings. Benign samples are correctly scored as low risk. Overall, the dependency poses a significant security concern due to the signs of obfuscation and malicious activity."
