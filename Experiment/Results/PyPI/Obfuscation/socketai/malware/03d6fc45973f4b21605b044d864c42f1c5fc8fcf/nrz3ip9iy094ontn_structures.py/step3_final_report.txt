{
  "purpose": "Defines custom, obfuscated mapping and dictionary-like classes primarily for internal data storage and retrieval, with no external interactions.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters, internal data structures (__dict__, OrderedDict), and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Internal data access via __getitem__, __repr__, and iteration; no external data flows or system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from initialization into internal storage, then accessed via get/set methods and __repr__ for display.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, use of __dict__ for data access, and internal storage mechanisms that obscure purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two classes: one custom mapping with case-insensitive keys stored in an OrderedDict, and another lookup class extending dict with internal data access. No network, file, or system operations are present. Obfuscation is notable but appears to serve as internal data management rather than malicious concealment. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or external data leaks are detected. The use of __dict__ and obfuscated names raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The code functions as internal data structures with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but benign, serving as internal data containers without malicious behavior. The low malware score and low security risk are justified. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, though it warrants cautious review in security-sensitive contexts.",
