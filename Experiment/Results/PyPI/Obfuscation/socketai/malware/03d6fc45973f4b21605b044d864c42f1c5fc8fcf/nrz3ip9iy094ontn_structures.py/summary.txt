  "security_risk": 0.2,

  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but benign, serving as internal data containers without malicious behavior. The low malware score and low security risk are justified. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, though it warrants cautious review in security-sensitive contexts."
