  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variable initialization, network routines, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded IPs/domains.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, potential data exfiltration, dynamic code execution paths.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (environment variables, hardcoded strings) to network routines and eval/exec functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, hardcoded IPs/domains, dynamic execution, suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with hardcoded network addresses and environment variables, indicating potential malicious intent. The presence of network routines suggests possible data exfiltration or remote control capabilities. The obfuscation and dynamic code execution increase suspicion, while the lack of concrete malicious payloads reduces certainty. The code's benign appearance in some parts suggests mixed signals, but overall, the suspicious patterns justify elevated concern.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains significant indicators of malicious behavior, primarily due to obfuscation, dynamic execution, and suspicious network activity. While not definitively malicious, the evidence warrants caution and further detailed analysis. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is substantial.",
