  "purpose": "To provide information about the default CA certificate bundle used by the requests module.",
  "sources": "The module reads the default CA bundle information, likely from the certifi package.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only describes a configuration aspect.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to contain a malformed or partial line 'requests.certs' and a corrupted comment line 'wkmOnVRQSCTUnxHmuVQhMtsuEevkvzjY.g.', suggesting possible obfuscation or corruption.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal and seems to be either incomplete or obfuscated. The line 'requests.certs' might intend to access or reference the certs attribute, but as written, it is a syntax error or fragment. The comment contains random characters, possibly indicating corruption, obfuscation, or an attempted concealment. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Overall, the snippet appears to be a fragment or malformed documentation, not an executable malicious script.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a fragment or documentation snippet with some corruption or obfuscation, but no harmful intent is detectable.",
