  "conclusion": "The snippets show standard requests usage but are heavily obfuscated, which warrants further source verification. No active malicious activity is evident, but obfuscation raises suspicion. The overall security risk is low, with a low malware score, but the obfuscation score remains high. Further review of unobfuscated source code is recommended before deployment."
