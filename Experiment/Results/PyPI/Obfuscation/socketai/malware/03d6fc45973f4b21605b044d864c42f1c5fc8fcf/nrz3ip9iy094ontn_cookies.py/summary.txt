  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard, heavily obfuscated cookie compatibility layer. While the obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or system compromise. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate; caution is advised due to obfuscation, but no active malicious intent is demonstrated."
