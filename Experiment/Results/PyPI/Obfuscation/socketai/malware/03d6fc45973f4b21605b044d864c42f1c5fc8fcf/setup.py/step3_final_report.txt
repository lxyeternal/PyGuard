  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project, including dependencies, version checks, and custom test commands.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from external __version__.py via exec(), reading README.md, command-line arguments, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "os.system calls for publishing, exec() on version file, dynamic import of pytest modules.",
  "flows": "Version check triggers exit; exec() loads version info; system commands for publishing; command-line args trigger publish sequence.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info without validation; obfuscated variable and class names; dynamic class inheritance; command execution via os.system; complex, obfuscated code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py with obfuscation and dynamic execution. exec() is used to load version info, which is common but risky if the file is compromised. Obfuscated naming suggests an attempt to conceal intent but does not inherently indicate malicious activity. System commands for publishing are standard but should be secured. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The obfuscation and exec() usage are potential vectors if environment is tampered, but no evidence of malicious payloads or behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a standard setup configuration with obfuscation and dynamic execution. There are no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The primary concern is the use of exec() on external files, which should be validated, but this is common in setup scripts. Malware score is 0, risk score is moderate (~0.3), and obfuscation is high (~0.6), aligning with the observed code complexity and naming.",
