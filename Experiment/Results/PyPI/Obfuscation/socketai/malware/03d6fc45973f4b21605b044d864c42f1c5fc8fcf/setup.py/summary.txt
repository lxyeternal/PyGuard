  "conclusion": "The script functions as a standard setup configuration with obfuscation and dynamic execution. There are no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The primary concern is the use of exec() on external files, which should be validated, but this is common in setup scripts. Malware score is 0, risk score is moderate (~0.3), and obfuscation is high (~0.6), aligning with the observed code complexity and naming."
