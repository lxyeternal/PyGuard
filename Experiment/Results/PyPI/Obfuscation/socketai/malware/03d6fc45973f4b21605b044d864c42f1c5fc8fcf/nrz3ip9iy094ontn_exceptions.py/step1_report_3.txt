{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP errors and JSON decoding errors, with some embedded obfuscated code and string constants.",
  "sources": "Import statements for exceptions; string decoding via base64; class attribute assignments and initializations.",
  "sinks": "Execution of obfuscated code using exec; potential use of dynamically compiled code; no direct data output or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated code executed after class definition; no clear source-to-sink data flow evident beyond class initializations and obfuscated string execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated base64-decoded code executed via exec; unusual class inheritance structure; very long class and variable names with no clear purpose; embedded base64 string that, when decoded, executes additional code; no documentation or comments explaining intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines custom exception classes with highly obfuscated names and string constants. The most significant anomaly is the use of __import__('build').exec() on dynamically decoded base64 string, which, when decoded, imports modules, compiles, and executes additional obfuscated code. The string appears to download or execute code from a remote source, which is suspicious. The class inheritance and attribute usage are typical for exception handling but are obscured. No clear indication of malicious intent in standard class definitions; however, the embedded obfuscated execution strongly suggests malicious or at least suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically executed code that could be malicious, likely intended to run hidden payloads or fetch additional malicious code. While the class definitions alone are benign, the embedded obfuscated execution and code obfuscation techniques are high-risk indicators.",
