{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define custom exception classes related to HTTP errors and JSON decoding errors, with some obfuscated imports and base classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements including obfuscated module names and base64-decoded code, especially the exec and compile functions with base64 payload.",
  "sinks": "exec and compile functions executing decoded code, potential use of untrusted or malicious payload embedded within the base64 string.",
  "flows": "Import obfuscated modules -> decode base64 string -> compile -> execute via exec, leading to dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated module names, base64-encoded code executed dynamically, multiple classes with randomly generated names, no clear documentation or meaningful identifiers, code includes potentially malicious code embedded as encoded string.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules with obfuscated names and uses base64 decoding and dynamic execution (exec and compile) on the decoded string. The payload appears to import a module named 'NamedTemporaryFile', then executes code that seems designed to download and execute external scripts or payloads, suggesting malicious intent. The numerous class definitions with random names seem to be noise or obfuscation. The core suspicious element is the code that decodes a base64 string, compiles it, and executes it, which is a common technique to hide malicious payloads. The obfuscation, combined with dynamic code execution, strongly indicates malicious intent. No legitimate purpose is apparent from these patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code contains obfuscated imports, dynamic execution of decoded base64 payloads, and a complex class structure likely used to hide malicious activities. The presence of code that downloads or executes external scripts suggests high risk of malicious behavior, indicating this package may be compromised or intentionally malicious.",
