  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP errors and related error handling, with some obfuscated and encoded code possibly for concealment.",
  "sources": "Import statements, base class initializations, and an embedded base64-encoded payload executed at runtime.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically compiled code from decoded base64 string, and possible use of imported exceptions. No clear data leaks or untrusted data flows are evident outside the obfuscated payload.",
  "flows": "Imports -> class definitions -> runtime execution of dynamically decoded and executed code, which may contain further source-to-sink behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import alias names, intentionally confusing class names, and embedded base64-encoded code executed via exec. The code within the payload appears to import modules and execute code dynamically, which is suspicious. Several class names and variables are nonsensical or obfuscated, possibly hiding malicious intent. The embedded base64 string, when decoded, appears to import modules and run code that could perform network requests or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, some inheriting from standard errors like IOError and ValueError, with heavily obfuscated class and variable names. It uses import aliasing with meaningless names, making static analysis harder. Notably, there is an embedded base64-encoded string decoded and executed at runtime, which imports 'templefile' and performs a 'write' operation with a URL, indicating potential malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or remote code execution. The code structure, heavy obfuscation, and embedded payload suggest an attempt to conceal malicious activity. No direct malicious behavior is apparent from static parts alone, but the runtime behavior, especially the execution of decoded code, indicates a high risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears primarily to set up obfuscated exception classes but includes a suspicious embedded payload that, when decoded, attempts to import modules and execute code dynamically. This behavior strongly suggests malicious intent, likely designed to conceal malicious actions such as data exfiltration or remote control. Static analysis indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to obfuscation and runtime code execution.",
