{
  "purpose": "Environment setup with conditional imports and compatibility handling, primarily for Python version detection and module imports.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, version info from sys, module availability checks.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is read from untrusted sources or written to external sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code performs setup tasks only.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names, conditional imports based on module availability, redefinition of built-in types.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard environment and compatibility setup, with obfuscated variable names that could be intended to conceal complexity. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious intent, and the code does not perform any harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as environment setup with obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware likelihood remains at zero. Overall security risk is minimal.",
