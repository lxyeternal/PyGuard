  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, input streams, potential network endpoints, dynamic code execution (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration via network, system modifications, or malicious control flow via eval/exec.",
  "flows": "Sources (input/env) to sinks (network, eval/exec), possibly through obfuscated variables and dynamic code paths.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, complex control flow, and variable obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are typical indicators of malicious intent. The presence of eval()/exec() and suspicious network calls suggest potential data exfiltration or malicious control. No hardcoded secrets or clear benign patterns are observed. The high obfuscation score (0.9) and malware score (0.75) are justified by these indicators. The overall security risk score (0.8) reflects the high likelihood of malicious behavior. Benign code samples show no suspicious activity, with low scores and high confidence. The analysis aligns with the scores, and the evidence supports the conclusion of malicious intent in the flagged code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscation, dynamic execution, and suspicious network activity, indicating a high probability of malicious behavior. The scores assigned are consistent with these findings. Benign samples are correctly scored as low risk. Overall, the dependency poses a significant security concern due to the signs of obfuscation and malicious activity.",
