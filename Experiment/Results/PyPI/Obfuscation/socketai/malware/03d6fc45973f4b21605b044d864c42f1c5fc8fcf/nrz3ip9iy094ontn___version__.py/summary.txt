  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscation, dynamic execution, and suspicious network activity, indicating a high probability of malicious behavior. The scores assigned are consistent with these findings. Benign samples are correctly scored as low risk. Overall, the dependency poses a significant security concern due to the signs of obfuscation and malicious activity."
