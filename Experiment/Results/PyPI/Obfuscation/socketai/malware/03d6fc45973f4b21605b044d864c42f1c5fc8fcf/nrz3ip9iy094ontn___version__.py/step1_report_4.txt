  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a sample or utility script performing some form of data processing or interaction, but the exact intent is unclear due to lack of comments or context.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from environment variables, possibly reads files, and accepts user input through function parameters or input prompts.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (e.g., requests to external URLs), system commands, or file writes. Specifics depend on actual code execution points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network requests or system commands, passing through variables and functions that may process or modify the data.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No unusual code structures or obfuscation. No hidden or malicious constructs detected in the code snippet provided.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis reveals standard data handling patterns. No suspicious imports, no suspicious function calls, no obfuscated code. The code does not perform any actions that are clearly malicious, such as unauthorized network access, data exfiltration, or system modification. Without external context or specific functionality, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to be a normal utility or example script without malicious intent.",
