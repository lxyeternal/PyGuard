{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for malicious data theft, including stealing Discord tokens, MFA codes, cookies, passwords, and other sensitive information from the user's system, then exfiltrating this data via webhooks and remote uploads.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, system information, process lists, local files (browser storage, logins, cookies, wallet files), and user input via HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into external webhooks, HTTP POST requests, file uploads, and system commands (taskkill). Data is exfiltrated to remote servers (webhooks, gofile uploads).",
  "flows": "Data from system files, environment variables, and process lists are collected, decrypted, and sent over network requests (webhooks, file uploads). The code also kills specific processes and modifies files to extract sensitive information, then reports it via Discord webhooks.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, obfuscated variable names, repeated dynamic imports, use of system commands to kill processes, extensive system file access for browser, wallet, and game data, and attempts to disable MFA and extract backup codes indicate malicious intent. The code also dynamically modifies files and injects code into Discord-related directories.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated with misleading variable names and dynamic imports, indicating malicious intent. It collects user information, cookies, passwords, MFA tokens, and other sensitive data from various browsers, Discord, wallet applications, and games. It uses threading for concurrent execution and uploads data to external servers. The presence of system process termination commands targeting Discord processes, and the collection of local system data, are typical of malware designed for theft and persistence. The code also includes functions to upload files, disable MFA, and perform network requests to exfiltrate data, which are clear indicators of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is malicious, primarily aimed at stealing user credentials, tokens, MFA codes, cookies, and other sensitive data, then exfiltrating via webhooks and uploads. It also attempts process termination and system modification for persistence or disruption. The overall security risk is high.",
