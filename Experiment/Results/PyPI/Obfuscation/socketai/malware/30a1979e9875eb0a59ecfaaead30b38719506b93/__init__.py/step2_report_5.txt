  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code and the given context.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Purpose:** The report states the code functions as a malicious server-side script harvesting user data (tokens, MFA, cookies, passwords, emails, personal info) and exfiltrating via webhooks and file uploads. It notes active process termination, dynamic dependency installation, obfuscation, and complex data collection routines.\n\n**Sources & Sinks:** Data is gathered from environment variables, system info, browser storage, API responses, and then sent via webhooks, file uploads, or process termination commands.\n\n**Flow & Anomalies:** The report correctly identifies the code's active process killing, dynamic module installation, and extensive data exfiltration routines, matching the code's behavior of process termination, data collection, and external communication.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** The report rightly classifies the script as highly malicious, with high confidence and scores (malware=1, risk=1). The obfuscation score is also high (~0.9), which aligns with the code's obfuscated variable names and complex routines.\n\n**Score suggestion:** The report's scores seem reasonable and justified given the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Purpose:** Similar to report 1, emphasizing data theft of tokens, MFA, cookies, passwords, and exfiltration via webhooks and remote uploads.\n\n**Sources & Sinks:** The sources include environment variables, process lists, local files, and user input. Sinks are webhooks, HTTP requests, and process commands.\n\n**Flow & Anomalies:** It notes suspicious URLs, dynamic imports, process termination, extensive system file access, and injection into Discord directories, all matching the code's actions.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** The report concludes the code is malicious with high severity, citing the same behaviors: data theft, process sabotage, exfiltration, obfuscation, and malicious intent.\n\n**Score suggestion:** The high malware (1.0), obfuscation (~0.8), and risk (1.0) scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Purpose:** Again, identifies the code as a comprehensive info stealer targeting Discord, browsers, wallets, and gaming apps, with functions for extracting credentials, MFA, and user data, and exfiltration routines.\n\n**Sources & Sinks:** Data from environment, local files, process lists, with exfiltration via webhooks, file uploads, and process termination.\n\n**Flow & Anomalies:** The report highlights obfuscation, process killing, extensive data collection, and stealth techniques, all matching the code's behavior.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is characterized as malware with high confidence, malicious intent, and high security risk.\n\n**Score suggestion:** The scores (malware=1, obfuscated=0.2-0.8, risk=1) are consistent with the behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Purpose:** Marked as \"Empty response\" with no further details.\n\n**Analysis:** Since no data or reasoning is provided, this report is invalid for scoring or assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Purpose:** Similar to previous reports, describing the code as a malicious info stealer targeting Discord tokens, MFA, cookies, passwords, and system info, with active sabotage (process killing), data exfiltration, and file manipulation.\n\n**Sources & Sinks:** Sources include environment variables, system commands, browser storage, Discord API responses. Sinks are webhooks, file uploads, process termination, and data copying.\n\n**Flow & Anomalies:** The report correctly notes obfuscation, dynamic module installs, process termination commands, extensive data collection routines, and exfiltration routines, matching the code.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is classified as malware with very high malicious intent, high confidence, and high security risk. The obfuscation score is high (~0.8), which aligns with the code's obfuscated variable names and complex routines.\n\n**Score suggestion:** The scores (malware=1, obfuscated=0.8, risk=1) are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n- The code is clearly designed for malicious purposes: data theft, process sabotage, exfiltration.\n- Multiple functions explicitly target Discord tokens, MFA, cookies, passwords, browser data, and system info.\n- It actively terminates processes, manipulates files, and exfiltrates data via webhooks and uploads.\n- Obfuscation is high, with complex, misleading variable names, dynamic imports, and partial code snippets.\n- The code's behavior matches malware activity: stealth, data exfiltration, sabotage.\n\n### **Conclusion & Final Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 1 (definite malware activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** Given the code's complexity and obfuscation hints, **0.8** (highly obfuscated)\n- **Risk:** 1 (severe security risk, data theft, process sabotage)\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:** The reports are consistent, justified, and align with the code's behavior. The detailed analysis confirms the malicious intent, high severity, and obfuscation level.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 1  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.8  \n- **Risk score:** 1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's observed behavior.",
