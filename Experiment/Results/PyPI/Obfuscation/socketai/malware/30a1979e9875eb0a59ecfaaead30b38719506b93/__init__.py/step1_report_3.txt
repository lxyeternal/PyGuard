{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a malicious malware component designed to steal sensitive user data such as cookies, passwords, Discord tokens, MFA codes, and other personal information, then exfiltrate it via webhooks to an attacker-controlled server. It includes functions for extracting browser credentials, Discord account info, MFA codes, and other user data, and reports the collected information in detailed embedded messages.",
  "sources": "User input is primarily read from environment variables, API requests, and local files (browser databases, cookies, local state files). The code also reads process lists and directories to identify specific software or browser profiles.",
  "sinks": "The main sinks are HTTP POST requests to attacker-controlled webhooks and external URLs, which send the exfiltrated data. It also executes commands to kill processes and manipulate files (e.g., copying browser data, zipping files). It writes data to temporary files and sends them over network requests.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as browser databases, environment variables, and process lists into extraction functions. Extracted data (tokens, cookies, credentials, MFA codes) are assembled into formatted messages and sent via webhooks. The code also kills specific processes, copies, archives, and uploads files containing sensitive information.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes self-termination if running in known user contexts, frequent network requests to suspicious URLs, dynamically installing modules, and extensive data exfiltration routines. The presence of functions targeting Discord, Steam, wallets, and browser profiles strongly indicates malicious intent. The code also manipulates files and registry-like paths suspiciously. Several sections are inconsistent or malformed, suggesting obfuscation or partial code snippets.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by checking user name and device identifiers, exiting if known 'white' users are detected. It installs necessary libraries and imports modules related to requests, cryptography, and Windows API functions. It then defines functions to extract data from browser storage, Windows credentials, and Discord accounts, as well as functions to kill processes, archive files, and upload data. Many functions perform malicious activities: stealing cookies, passwords, browser data, Discord tokens, MFA codes, and other personal info. The code further checks running processes for Discord, then terminates relevant processes, copies profile data, and creates archives. It attempts to send data via webhooks with detailed embeds, including tokens, emails, IP info, and other user details. The code is designed to operate stealthily, avoiding detection by checking process names and device IDs before proceeding. Overall, the code demonstrates extensive malicious behavior aimed at compromising user accounts, stealing data, and exfiltrating it without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info stealer targeting Discord, browsers, wallets, and gaming applications. It uses various techniques to extract sensitive data, manipulate files, and send information to attacker-controlled servers. Its purpose is clearly malicious, and it should be considered malware with a very high security risk score.",
