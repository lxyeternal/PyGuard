{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'calculator' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata such as classifiers, name, version, license, and dependencies from the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the setup configuration does not execute or write data externally.",
  "flows": "The data flows are limited to static assignments within the setup() call; no dynamic or external input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., onRqVVliTDcGCITuPIaTENirPYeQsvjs, KKULfykiZdPccftWyRScovHQcxVqXrst) with no meaningful identifiers, which could be suspicious. The parameter 'onRqVVliTDcGCITuPIaTENirPYeQsvjs' is used twice, possibly indicating confusion or obfuscation, but it only contains static classifier data.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. All data are static strings, and there is no dynamic code execution, data input, or external communication. The obfuscation appears superficial and likely for code minification or trivial obfuscation, not malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are present. The setup parameters are consistent with normal package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation, no malicious behavior detected. No malware or security risks are evident.",
