  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools; string variables containing package metadata; setup() function call with arguments.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function parameters that configure package distribution, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Variables assigned to metadata strings are passed into setup(), which configures package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking variable names; empty install_requires list; no explicit input or output data streams; no suspicious code behavior or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the standard 'setuptools' module, defines several variables with seemingly obfuscated or nonsensical names assigned to static strings (mostly package metadata), and calls setup() with parameters referencing these variables. The 'install_requires' list is empty, indicating no dependencies. Variable names do not match standard conventions and appear intentionally obfuscated but contain no malicious or suspicious content. The code functions as a typical setup.py configuration, with no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The obfuscation appears superficial and for aesthetic or obfuscation purposes rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup.py script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious or maliciously intended code present. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
