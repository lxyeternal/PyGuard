{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package named 'calculator', defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function, including package name, version, license, classifiers, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; all data is static and hardcoded within the script.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., onRqVVliTDcGCITuPIaTENirPYeQsvjs) which are superficial and do not affect functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or malicious patterns. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for aesthetic or minor concealment purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The 'install_requires' list is empty, which is typical if no dependencies are needed. The overall structure and static nature of the code suggest it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The current malware score of 0 is appropriate, with a moderate obfuscation score (~0.7) reflecting the superficial obfuscation. The security risk remains low (~0.2). Overall, the package appears safe for use.",
