  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'calculator' with version 1.0.0.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools; assignment of package metadata variables; setup() function with parameters including package name, version, license, classifiers, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call which initiates package installation process; no direct data leaks or system effects observed.",
  "flows": "Imports and variable assignments lead to the setup() invocation; no data flow from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., onRqVVliTDcGCITuPIaTENirPYeQsvjs, KKULfykiZdPccftWyRScovHQcxVqXrst) which are unnecessary and could hide malicious intent. The 'install_requires' list is empty, which is unusual but not malicious. No suspicious code execution or network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to be a standard Python package setup script with intentionally obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network calls, file manipulation, or sensitive data handling. The obfuscation seems intended to conceal intent but does not introduce malicious behavior. The empty 'install_requires' list suggests minimal dependencies. Overall, it functions as a typical setup script, with the only concern being obfuscation that could hide malicious intent but does not explicitly do so.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from the provided code. The obfuscation does not necessarily indicate malicious intent but warrants cautious review if used in a broader context.",
