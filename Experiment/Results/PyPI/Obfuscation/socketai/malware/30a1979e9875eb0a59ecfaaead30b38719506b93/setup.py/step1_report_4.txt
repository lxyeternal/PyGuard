  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'calculator'.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from variables such as the package metadata (name, version, license, classifiers, install_requires).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; the script primarily defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "Metadata variables are assigned, then passed to setup() to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., onRqVVliTDcGCITuPIaTENirPYeQsvjs, KKULfykiZdPccftWyRScovHQcxVqXrst) without clear purpose; inconsistent naming suggests obfuscation or masking.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup from setuptools, defines several variables with non-descriptive names, and calls setup() with these variables. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which is unusual for standard setup scripts but not inherently malicious. The setup() call includes package metadata like name, version, license, and classifiers, with no suspicious parameters. The install_requires list is empty, which is standard if no dependencies are needed. There is no code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input observed. The obfuscation of variable names could be a sign of concealment, but it alone does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a normal package setup with obfuscated variable names.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation is unusual but not malicious. The package appears safe for use.",
