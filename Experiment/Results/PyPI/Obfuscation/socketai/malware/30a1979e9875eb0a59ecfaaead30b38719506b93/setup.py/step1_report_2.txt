  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'calculator' with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, string literals defining package metadata, and setup() function call with parameters.",
  "sinks": "setup() function parameters that define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> Metadata variable assignments -> setup() call with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-standard variable names with random strings, no explicit data input sources, and empty dependency list. No suspicious code or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, assigns package metadata and configuration variables with unusual variable names, then calls setup() to configure the package. The metadata appears legitimate, with standard fields like version, license, and package name. No hardcoded credentials, malicious functions, or suspicious behaviors are present. The variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent; they seem to serve as placeholders or obfuscation for code aesthetics. The install_requires list is empty, indicating no additional dependencies, which is normal. Overall, the code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names but no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation seems superficial and does not impact the security or functionality.",
