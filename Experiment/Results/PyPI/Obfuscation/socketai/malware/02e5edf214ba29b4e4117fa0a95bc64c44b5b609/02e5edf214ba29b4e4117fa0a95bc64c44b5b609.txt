      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates suspicious behavior through stealthy, obfuscated PowerShell command execution during package setup. The high obfuscation and stealth techniques justify elevated malware and security risk scores. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent. All reports correctly identify these indicators, and the overall risk should be considered high."
