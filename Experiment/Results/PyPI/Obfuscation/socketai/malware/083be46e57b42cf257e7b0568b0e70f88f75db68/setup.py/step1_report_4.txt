{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with added functionality to perform network requests and download/execute a file during installation.",
  "sources": "os.environ['COMPUTERNAME'] for environment variable; requests.get() calls to external URLs; open() to write files; os.system() to execute downloaded files",
  "sinks": "os.system() executes the downloaded file, potentially malicious executable; open() writes a potentially malicious payload to disk",
  "flows": "environment variable -> requests.get() to external URL -> download file -> save to disk -> os.system() to execute downloaded file",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names and class names; external URL used for downloading executable; use of try-except without handling; executing downloaded files during installation; no clear legitimate purpose for these actions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it via a GET request to a suspicious domain. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from a potentially malicious URL and executes it using os.system(). This behavior is embedded within a custom install command class that triggers during package installation. The obfuscated naming and the act of downloading and executing external files during setup strongly indicate malicious intent, as it could install malware or backdoors without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior, specifically downloading and executing potentially harmful files during installation. The obfuscated code and network activity suggest malicious intent. It poses a high security risk and should not be used.",
