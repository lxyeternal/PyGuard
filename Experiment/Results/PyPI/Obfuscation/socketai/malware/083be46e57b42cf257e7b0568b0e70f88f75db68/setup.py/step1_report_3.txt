{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it contains hidden malicious behavior intended to execute additional malicious payloads during installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', and the downloaded file 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe'",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, writing to disk, executing downloaded file via os.system('start ...')",
  "flows": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> Sends GET request with this info -> Downloads an executable file -> Executes the downloaded file",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, attempt to download and execute a binary file during package installation, no visible legitimate purpose, use of broad except clause suppressing errors, code structure designed to hide malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and additional modules, then defines a function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, sends it via GET request to a suspicious URL, and conditionally downloads and executes an executable file if on Windows. The class extending 'install' overrides the install method to invoke this malicious function during package installation. All these behaviors indicate an attempt to infect the system with additional malware or backdoors during setup, with obfuscated naming and hidden payloads designed to evade detection.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to download and execute a payload during installation, representing a supply chain threat. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
