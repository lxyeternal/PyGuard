{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with additional functions that perform network requests and potentially download and execute an executable file.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', HTTP GET requests to external URLs, reading local files for writing executable content",
  "sinks": "Downloading and executing an executable file ('ini_file_pyp_32.exe') via os.system, sending data to external URL ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php')",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> Sending data to external URL, HTTP response content -> Saving as executable file -> Executing file via os.system",
  "anomalies": "Function MOxRZjSbEhjysdOQfPYiHIxpBDwGfRSA() performs network requests and downloads an executable file, then executes it without user consent or validation; this behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious. The use of obfuscated or nonsensical variable and function names adds to suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and requests library. It defines a function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a suspicious URL. If running on Windows, it downloads an executable from a hardcoded URL and executes it via os.system, which could be malicious. The custom install class invokes this function during installation, potentially executing malicious payload during package installation. The code contains no validation or checks for the downloaded content. The obfuscated function and variable names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior: it collects system information, contacts external servers, downloads, and executes an external executable without user consent. The behavior indicates an attempt at remote code execution and possible malware distribution during package installation.",
