{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it contains embedded malicious behavior intended to perform remote communications and potentially execute malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URL requests to 'linkedopports.com' and 'python-release.com', file writing and execution commands.",
  "sinks": "Writing to files ('ini_file_pyp_32.exe') and executing system commands ('start <file>') with the downloaded content.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is used to craft a request to a remote server; the response triggers download and execution of a potentially malicious executable.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual and suspicious activity such as fetching data from suspicious domains, writing a file named as an executable, and then executing it. Use of environment variables for remote info collection. The overall flow resembles malware behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then sends this info to a suspicious domain. It conditionally downloads an executable file from a questionable URL and executes it, which is typical of malware. The class overrides the install command to include this malicious function during package installation. No legitimate setup practices justify these behaviors. The code’s purpose is disguised as a setup process but performs malicious remote communication and payload execution.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior designed to contact remote servers, download, and execute potentially harmful payloads during package installation. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious.",
