{
  "purpose": "The function prints a message indicating installation or presence of the script.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to standard output via print statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources; the function simply executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated and randomly generated, which may be suspicious. No external data sources, environment variables, or network activity are present. No credentials or secrets are hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a single function with an obfuscated name that prints a message. The function is immediately invoked after definition. The code lacks any external data input, environment interaction, or network activity. The obfuscated function name could suggest an attempt to hide intent, but the actual code performs only a benign print statement. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The simplicity and obfuscation could be used to hide malicious intent, but in this case, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, benign, and performs only a print statement. Although the function name is obfuscated, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low.",
