      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command conditioned on filesystem state. The use of encoding and stealth execution techniques aligns with common malicious supply chain tactics. Scores reflect significant risk, and further investigation of the payload is recommended."
