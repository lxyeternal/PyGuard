  "purpose": "Detect and evaluate potential malicious behavior or sabotage in the Python package code, focusing on obfuscated PowerShell execution and supply chain risks.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen; package setup code.",
  "sinks": "PowerShell process with encoded command; hidden window execution; silent error handling.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check -> conditional execution -> subprocess.Popen with encoded command -> stealthy payload execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command executed with hidden window; broad try-except blocks suppress errors; conditional trigger based on filesystem state.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory; if absent, executes a hidden, encoded PowerShell command, indicating stealthy behavior. The command is heavily obfuscated, a common tactic in malicious payloads. Error handling is broad and silent, masking potential failures. The package setup appears standard, but the payload execution raises suspicion. Scores assigned in reports (malware 0.75-0.8, obfuscated 0.9-1, risk 0.75-0.9) are justified given the obfuscation and stealth techniques. Without decoding the payload, definitive maliciousness cannot be confirmed, but the techniques strongly suggest malicious intent or high potential for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command conditioned on filesystem state. The use of encoding and stealth execution techniques aligns with common malicious supply chain tactics. Scores reflect significant risk, and further investigation of the payload is recommended.",
