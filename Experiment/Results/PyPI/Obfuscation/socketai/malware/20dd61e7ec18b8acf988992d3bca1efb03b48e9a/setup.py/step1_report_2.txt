{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package, but it also attempts to execute hidden PowerShell commands if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existence of the 'tahg' directory from the filesystem; it also attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call is a sink that executes a PowerShell command with hidden window style, potentially executing malicious code or payload.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code executes the PowerShell command, which could perform malicious actions, then proceeds with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded, obfuscated, and executed without clear purpose. The code suppresses exceptions silently, which may hide failures or malicious intent. The direct execution of an encoded command suggests potential obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code first imports setup from distutils.core, then checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists. If not, it attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, likely to run a hidden script or payload. This command is executed in a subprocess with no window, suggesting concealment. The package setup section seems standard, with version and classifier metadata. The try-except blocks suppress errors, which could hide issues or malicious failures. The encoded command is suspicious and likely intended to run obfuscated malicious code, representing a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script combines standard package setup with a hidden, potentially malicious PowerShell execution. The use of encoded commands, silent error handling, and the conditional execution based on filesystem state indicates malicious intent or sabotage. This package contains suspicious behavior and should be considered unsafe for use.",
