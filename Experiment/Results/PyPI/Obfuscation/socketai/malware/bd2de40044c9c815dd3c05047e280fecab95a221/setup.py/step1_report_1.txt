  "purpose": "The code is intended to define the setup configuration for a Python package, including its name and version.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' and 'find_packages' functions from 'setuptools' are imported; the 'setup' function is called with package name and version.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing setup tools to executing a setup with fixed parameters, with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are observed; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard packaging functions and executes a basic setup call with static name and version strings. It does not process user input, read external data, or execute dynamic code. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident in the fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
