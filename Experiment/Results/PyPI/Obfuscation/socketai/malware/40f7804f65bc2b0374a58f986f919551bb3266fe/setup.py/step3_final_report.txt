{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a binary from a suspicious URL, writes it to /tmp/node, makes it executable, and runs it with an argument, all during package setup. It also creates an empty /tmp/.gitler file. This behavior indicates malicious intent, likely a supply chain attack.",
  "sources": "requests.get() fetching from 'https://github-bebra.s3.filebase.com/node', reading external content.",
  "sinks": "Writing to /tmp/node, executing /tmp/node with subprocess, creating /tmp/.gitler.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves external binary -> writes to /tmp/node -> chmod +x /tmp/node -> executes /tmp/node -c .gitler.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name, no validation of downloaded content, immediate execution during setup, creation of unnecessary empty file /tmp/.gitler, suspicious URL hosting binary.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that downloads a binary from a suspicious URL, writes it to /tmp, makes it executable, and runs it with an argument. It also creates an empty file /tmp/.gitler. The function is invoked immediately, executing potentially malicious code during package setup. The URL and behavior strongly suggest malicious activity, such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The code lacks validation or checksum verification, increasing risk. The obfuscated function name and suspicious URL are indicators of malicious intent. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing remote code download and execution during package installation, representing a high security threat. The malicious activity justifies maximum malware and risk scores, with a high confidence level.",
