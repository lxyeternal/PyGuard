{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with a setup configuration, but also executes a malicious payload that downloads and runs external code.",
  "sources": "The function DLZoDxjnvunKYWwYcSoFsnGqwmqxkyTc() reads data from an external URL and writes files to /tmp directory.",
  "sinks": "The code writes a binary payload to /tmp/node, makes it executable, and runs it with specific arguments, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "The external URL content is downloaded and saved as /tmp/node -> permissions are changed -> the executable is run, which may execute malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual function name; code downloads and executes external binary without validation; writing to /tmp/.gitler with no content; no error handling for download success; obfuscated function name.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function with an obscure name that, when executed, attempts to download a binary from a suspicious URL. It writes this binary to /tmp/node, sets execute permissions, and executes it with a parameter. The use of a hidden filename (.gitler) with no content indicates potential attempt to hide malicious activity. The code then proceeds to set up a Python package using setuptools, which appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload. The download URL is hosted on a suspicious domain, and the payload is executed directly, which is highly risky. The code lacks validation or verification of the downloaded content, increasing risk. Overall, the malicious behavior involves downloading and executing external code without validation, which could compromise system security.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing external code covertly. It is a malicious supply chain attack attempt embedded within a seemingly legitimate package setup. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score should reflect this.",
