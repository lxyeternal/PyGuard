  "purpose": "Setup package configuration and execute a malicious payload that downloads and executes a remote file.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://github-bebra.s3.filebase.com/node' from which content is fetched.",
  "sinks": "Writing to '/tmp/node' and '/tmp/.gitler'; executing './node -c .gitler' which runs downloaded code.",
  "flows": "Requests.get() retrieves remote content, writes to '/tmp/node'; subsequent system call executes this file with specific arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading an executable from a suspicious URL and executing it without validation; writing an empty file to '.gitler' but then executing the downloaded 'node' file; obfuscated function name.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for package setup. It defines a function with an obfuscated name that, when invoked, attempts to download a file from a suspicious URL and save it as '/tmp/node'. It then makes this file executable and runs it with specific arguments, likely to execute malicious code. An empty '.gitler' file is created but not used. The function is invoked immediately, ensuring the malicious download and execution occurs during package setup. The package setup configuration appears standard but is used as a vector for malicious activity. The code has no input validation and relies on executing remote code, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains clear malicious behavior: it downloads and executes remote code during package setup, representing a supply chain attack. The use of obfuscated function names and suspicious URL confirms malicious intent. The package is dangerous and should not be used.",
