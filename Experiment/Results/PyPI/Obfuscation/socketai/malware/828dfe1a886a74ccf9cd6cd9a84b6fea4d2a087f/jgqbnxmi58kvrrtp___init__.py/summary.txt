  "malware_score": 0.9,
  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits classic malware behavior: remote payload download, persistence via startup folder, and immediate execution without validation. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, with minor adjustments to obfuscation level. It should be flagged as malicious due to its high potential for harm."
