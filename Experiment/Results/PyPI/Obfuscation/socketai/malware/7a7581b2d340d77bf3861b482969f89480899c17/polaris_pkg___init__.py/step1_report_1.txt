  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or functionality, but the specific intent cannot be determined without examining the actual code content.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly identifiable without the code content. Common sources include environment variables, input functions, or file reads.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if present, but details are not provided in the prompt.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be established without the actual code. Typically, source-to-sink flows involve untrusted data being used insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies can be identified without code details. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are apparent in the absence of code content.",
  "analysis": "Due to the lack of provided code, a detailed step-by-step analysis is not possible. Normally, this involves reviewing input points, data handling, and output points for malicious or insecure behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information is provided to determine whether the code contains malicious behavior or security risks. The analysis cannot be completed without examining the actual code snippet.",
