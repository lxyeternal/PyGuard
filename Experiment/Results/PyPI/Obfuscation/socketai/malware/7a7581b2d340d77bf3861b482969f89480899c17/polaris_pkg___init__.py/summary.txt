  "conclusion": "The code is assessed as benign with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk scores reflect cautious estimation given incomplete information. No significant issues are identified, and the current scoring is appropriate. Slightly lowering the security risk from 0.2 to 0.1 in benign cases would enhance consistency without altering the overall low-risk conclusion."
