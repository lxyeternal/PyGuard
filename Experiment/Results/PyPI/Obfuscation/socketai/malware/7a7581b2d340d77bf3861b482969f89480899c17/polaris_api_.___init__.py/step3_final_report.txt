  "sources": "The data is system-generated metadata, not user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the data does not flow into any executable or network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows; the data is static metadata without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the data is a static, well-understood macOS quarantine attribute with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided data is a binary blob representing macOS quarantine extended attributes. All reviews correctly identify it as benign system metadata with no executable code, malicious payload, or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the static, non-malicious nature of the data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security risks. The data is system-generated and harmless, posing no threat. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the static and well-understood nature of the metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The data is harmless macOS quarantine metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified. No further action or scoring adjustments are necessary.",
