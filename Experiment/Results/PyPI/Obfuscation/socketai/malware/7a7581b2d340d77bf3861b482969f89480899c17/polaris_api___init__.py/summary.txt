  "conclusion": "Most reports accurately assess the security posture of the code snippets. The only notable adjustment is for Report 5, where suspicion warrants higher malware and risk scores. The current scoring system appropriately reflects the observed behaviors, with cautious but justified increases for potentially malicious features."
