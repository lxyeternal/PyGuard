  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without specific context, it is not clear. There are no obvious comments or documentation.",
  "sources": "Input is read from variables, function parameters, or environment variables. No direct input functions like input(), open(), or network reads are explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions, system commands, or network communications if present. None are explicitly shown or invoked in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., variables or environment variables) to processing functions, with no clear evidence of data reaching insecure or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution. It appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Step 1: The code is minimal and does not include external input or output functions. Step 2: No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious URLs are present. Step 3: No use of eval(), exec(), or other dynamic code execution methods. Step 4: The structure is simple and clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. Step 5: The overall pattern suggests a benign utility or processing script without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
