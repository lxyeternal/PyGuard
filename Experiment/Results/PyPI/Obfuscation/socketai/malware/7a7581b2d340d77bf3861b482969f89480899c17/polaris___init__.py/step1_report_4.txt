{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'api' and sets a version string for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .api module",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no data is being sent or written directly in this snippet",
  "flows": "Imported module contents are brought into the namespace; no direct data flow is evident",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) can obscure what is imported, but it is common in package __init__.py files; no other suspicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import and assigns a version string. The wildcard import could potentially introduce unwanted symbols into the namespace if not carefully managed, but this is a standard pattern for package __init__.py files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. The version string is straightforward and harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign; it is likely part of a package's __init__.py file establishing namespace and version info. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
