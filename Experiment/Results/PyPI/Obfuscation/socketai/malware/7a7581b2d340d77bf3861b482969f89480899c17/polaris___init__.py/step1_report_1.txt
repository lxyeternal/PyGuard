  "purpose": "Import all components from the local 'api' module and define the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.api' module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink; no data processing or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; only import and version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can be considered poor practice, but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'api', which could potentially mask what is being imported, but it does not execute any code, handle data, or perform network operations. The version string is a standard practice for package versioning. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malware behavior, or security issues in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module import and version declaration with no malicious behavior detected. The use of wildcard import is not recommended but not malicious. Overall, the code is benign.",
