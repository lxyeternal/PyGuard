  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "None; code does not process data or execute untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols; no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import in a package's __init__.py, which is common practice. No data processing, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The security implications depend on the contents of the 'api' module, which are unknown. The wildcard import is discouraged but not inherently malicious. The version string is harmless. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1-0.2) due to the import style. Confidence is high in benignity given the minimal code, but the potential risk hinges on the external 'api' module's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent or behavior. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious symbols if 'api' is compromised. However, without evidence, the scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk are appropriate. Monitoring the 'api' module is recommended, but based solely on this snippet, there are no security issues.",
