{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'api' and defines a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.api' module, reading the contents of the local module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, any code in the imported module can act as a sink if it performs malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The import pulls in code from 'api' which may contain further data flows; the version string is set statically.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .api import *' can obscure which functions or variables are imported, possibly hiding malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a single import and defining a version string. The import statement's safety depends entirely on the contents of the 'api' module, which is external and not shown here. The version string is static and non-malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors within this fragment itself. However, the import statement's nature warrants caution if the 'api' module is malicious, but this cannot be determined from this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears benign, merely importing a module and setting a version. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet alone, but reliance on the imported module's content is a potential security consideration.",
