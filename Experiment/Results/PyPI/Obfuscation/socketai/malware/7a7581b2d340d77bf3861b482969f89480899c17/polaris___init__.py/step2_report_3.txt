  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code with the described issues, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .api import *\n\n__version__ = '1.62'\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code is minimal, performing a wildcard import from a local module and setting a version string.\n- No data processing, network activity, or explicit handling of untrusted data.\n- Use of `import *` is generally discouraged because it obscures imported symbols, but it is common in package `__init__.py` files.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code in this snippet.\n- The actual security risk depends on the contents of the `api` module, which is not shown.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurate; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 (high confidence that code is benign)\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malware)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (low risk, mainly due to wildcard import practice)\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No issues found. The low security risk is justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correct; the import's safety depends on the `api` module content.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5 (moderate confidence)\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malware detected)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (caution due to wildcard import)\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes the potential risk but can't confirm maliciousness. The score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correct; the use of `import *` can hide malicious code, but there's no evidence here.\n- **Confidence:** 0.3 (low confidence)\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (appropriate, given the potential for hidden issues)\n- **Assessment:** The cautious stance is justified. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurate; the code is benign, likely part of a package's `__init__.py`.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (high confidence)\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard practice)\n- **Assessment:** Well-reasoned. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correct; the code is simple and benign, with a note on the `import *` practice.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6 (moderate-high)\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (reasonable)\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports agree that the code itself is benign.\n- The primary concern is the use of `import *`, which could potentially hide malicious code if the `api` module is compromised.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present in this snippet.\n- The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly at **0**.\n- The overall security risk score should be low, around **0.1 to 0.2**, considering the wildcard import practice but no actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to coding style, not security breach)\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, with no malicious intent or behavior. The only note is the use of `import *`, which is a common pattern in package `__init__.py` files but not recommended. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a very low security concern based on this snippet alone.",
