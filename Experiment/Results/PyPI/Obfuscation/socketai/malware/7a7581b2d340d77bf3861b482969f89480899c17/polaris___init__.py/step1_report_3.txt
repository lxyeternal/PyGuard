  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the 'api' module and sets a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.api' module",
  "sinks": "None present explicitly in this snippet",
  "flows": "Imported functions or variables from '.api' are available in the namespace, but no data flows are shown",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .api import *' can obscure which functions or variables are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unwanted code, but this alone is common in Python packages and not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a relative module named 'api' and defines a version string. No explicit input sources, data processing, or untrusted data flows are visible. The use of wildcard import could potentially hide malicious code within the 'api' module, but without inspecting 'api', this cannot be confirmed. The snippet is minimal and does not demonstrate malicious behavior on its own.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The use of 'import *' warrants caution but is common practice in package __init__.py files. No malware or security risks are apparent from this fragment.",
