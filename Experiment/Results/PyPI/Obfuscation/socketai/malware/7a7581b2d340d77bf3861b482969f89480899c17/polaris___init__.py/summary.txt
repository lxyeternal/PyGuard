  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent or behavior. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious symbols if 'api' is compromised. However, without evidence, the scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk are appropriate. Monitoring the 'api' module is recommended, but based solely on this snippet, there are no security issues."
