  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup. The suspicious obfuscation, silent execution, and error suppression justify a high security risk. Decoding the payload is recommended for definitive analysis, but current evidence warrants treating this as malicious."
