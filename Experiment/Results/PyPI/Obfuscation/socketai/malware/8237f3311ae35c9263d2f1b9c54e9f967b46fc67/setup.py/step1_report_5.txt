{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it contains malicious behavior aimed at exfiltrating system information via Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname and IP address using socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname().",
  "sinks": "It sends data to a Discord webhook URL using the discord.Webhook class and aiohttp.ClientSession, which could be used for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source functions (hostname and IP address) to the asynchronous function that sends this data over the network via Discord webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated class and function names, and the data sent includes hostname and IP with a hardcoded webhook URL. It executes an asynchronous send operation during installation, which is suspicious. The presence of Discord API usage in a setup script is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration that, during installation, executes a function sending the system's hostname and IP address to a Discord webhook. The use of obfuscated names and inclusion of code that communicates with external servers during setup indicates malicious intent. There are no other benign functionalities or legitimate setup behaviors. This pattern is consistent with malicious data exfiltration or backdoor activity embedded in a package install process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to send system information to an external Discord webhook during package installation. It uses obfuscation and suspicious external network activity, indicating a supply chain attack vector.",
