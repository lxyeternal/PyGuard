{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package with a custom installation command that sends hostname and IP address information to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), import statements for discord, aiohttp, asyncio",
  "sinks": "Discord webhook URL via Wbohook.from_url() and send() method, network communication via aiohttp, potentially sending hostname and IP info",
  "flows": "Data flows from socket functions (hostname, IP) to Discord webhook, via asynchronous HTTP request",
  "anomalies": "The code executes network activity during installation, sending system info to a remote Discord server. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the code imports suspicious modules like discord, aiohttp, asyncio without clear purpose outside reporting.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, when invoked, gathers the system hostname and IP address. It then asynchronously sends this information to a specified Discord webhook. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which is suspicious, and the code executes network communication during package installation—an unusual and potentially malicious behavior. The use of imported modules like discord, aiohttp, and asyncio for this purpose indicates intent to communicate with an external server upon package install. No clear benign purpose justifies this behavior. Overall, this behavior resembles data exfiltration or system info reporting at install time, which is malicious or at least suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes malicious behavior by sending system hostname and IP address data to an external Discord webhook during package installation, which could be used for tracking or data exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and network activity in setup routines raises high suspicion of malicious intent.",
