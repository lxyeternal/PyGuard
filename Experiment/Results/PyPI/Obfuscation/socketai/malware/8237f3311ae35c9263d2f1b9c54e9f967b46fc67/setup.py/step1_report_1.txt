{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it contains embedded malicious activity intended to send system information to an external Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Socket functions (socket.gethostname, socket.gethostbyname), imported modules (discord, aiohttp), Webhook URL, and asyncio task creation.",
  "sinks": "Sending data to Discord webhook via Webhook.send(), which transmits hostname and IP address.",
  "flows": "Data collected from socket functions flows into the async function MIBfrQlCxWMgjLUOsxmrLUGydsBSEArE, which sends hostname and IP via webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, hardcoded Discord webhook URL, the code executes asynchronously without any apparent reason related to setup process, and sends system info during install.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command class that, when run, imports system info (hostname and IP address) and sends this data to a specific Discord webhook URL. The obfuscation of class and function names, combined with the embedded webhook and data transmission during installation, suggests malicious intent. The activity is hidden within a setup script, which is normally used for package installation, but here it is used to leak system data without user consent. The modules imported (discord, aiohttp) are standard, but their use for unauthorized data exfiltration is suspicious. No other malicious actions, such as code execution or data theft beyond system info, are apparent, but the activity is covert and malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to exfiltrate system hostname and IP address during package installation via a Discord webhook. Its obfuscated naming and embedding in setup routines indicate malicious intent, likely for system reconnaissance or data collection without user awareness.",
