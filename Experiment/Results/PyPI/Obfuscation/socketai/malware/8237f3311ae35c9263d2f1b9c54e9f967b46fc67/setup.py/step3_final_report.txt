  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system hostname and IP address during package installation by sending this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname()",
  "sinks": "discord.Webhook.send() via aiohttp.ClientSession",
  "flows": "socket functions -> async function -> webhook.send()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, hardcoded webhook URL, data exfiltration during setup, asynchronous code executed during install",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during execution, imports modules, retrieves hostname and IP, and sends this information asynchronously to an external Discord webhook. The activity occurs during package installation, with obfuscated identifiers and embedded network activity, indicating covert data exfiltration. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the code executes without user consent, which are strong indicators of malicious behavior. The use of asynchronous functions within setup routines is suspicious and aligns with supply chain attack patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation, with obfuscation and hardcoded webhooks suggesting malicious intent. The activity is covert, automated, and potentially used for reconnaissance or tracking, warranting a high malware and security risk score.",
