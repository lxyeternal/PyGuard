{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for a Python package setup process, but it includes embedded malicious behavior involving data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname() for hostname and IP address, and the embedded webhook URL for data exfiltration.",
  "sinks": "Webhook.from_url and send() methods, which transmit hostname and IP address data to a Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Code retrieves hostname and IP, then asynchronously sends this data via Discord webhook, likely without user consent.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, use of asynchronous functions within a setup script, hardcoded webhook URL, and data exfiltration behavior embedded within what appears to be a package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for package setup and defines a class inheriting from 'install'. Within this class, a method collects the hostname and IP address using socket functions. It then defines an async function that creates a Discord webhook object and sends the hostname and IP to it, effectively exfiltrating system information. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating malicious intent. The method is invoked during installation, meaning this data collection and transmission occurs automatically during package installation. These behaviors strongly suggest malicious exfiltration of system data, likely intended for tracking or unauthorized surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior: it secretly collects system hostname and IP address and exfiltrates it to an external Discord webhook during package installation. The obfuscation, hardcoded webhook, and embedded network activity confirm malicious intent, representing a severe security threat.",
