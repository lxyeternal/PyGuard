{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script that, during installation, executes a function that sends the hostname and IP address to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname and IP address via socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname() functions.",
  "sinks": "The data (hostname and IP address) is sent to a Discord webhook URL using aiohttp and discord.Webhook, which acts as a sink for potentially sensitive data.",
  "flows": "The data flows from socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname() (sources) to the Discord webhook (sink) via an asynchronous function called during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of setup.py to send system information to an external server (Discord webhook) during package installation. The code contains obfuscated class and function names. The webhook URL is hardcoded. No validation or user consent is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that overrides the install method. Inside, it gathers hostname and IP address. An asynchronous function is defined to send this information to a Discord webhook. This function is called immediately. The use of obfuscated names and sending system info during package install are suspicious behaviors. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating potential exfiltration. No user interaction or explicit consent is obtained. The purpose seems to be to exfiltrate host information, possibly for malicious tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to secretly send system hostname and IP address to a remote Discord webhook during package installation. This behavior is suspicious and indicative of malicious activity, such as information exfiltration or tracking. The code's obfuscation and timing of data transmission raise significant security concerns.",
