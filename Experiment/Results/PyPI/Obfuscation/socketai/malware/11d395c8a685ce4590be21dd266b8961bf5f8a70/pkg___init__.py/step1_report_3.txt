  "purpose": "Assigns a string 'pipHack' to the variable 'name'.",
  "sources": "Assignment of a string literal to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow beyond variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'pipHack' could be suspicious; however, it alone does not indicate malicious intent. No other code present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string to a variable named 'name'. The string 'pipHack' might imply malicious intent or an attempt to disguise harmful behavior, but with no additional code, no malicious behavior can be inferred. No external inputs, no network activity, and no cryptic or obfuscated code are present. This appears to be a benign assignment statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of a single variable assignment with a potentially suspicious variable name but no actual malicious activity or security issues. It does not pose a security risk on its own.",
