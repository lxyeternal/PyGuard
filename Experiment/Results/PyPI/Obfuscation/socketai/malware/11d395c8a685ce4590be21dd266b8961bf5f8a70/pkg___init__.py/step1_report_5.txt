  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; no output or data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink due to minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'pipHack' may suggest malicious intent or suspicious naming, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string to a variable with no further operations. There are no data flows, external inputs, or outputs. The variable name may be considered suspicious but does not imply malicious behavior. The code does not invoke any functions, network activity, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and contains no malicious behavior. The only notable aspect is the variable name, which alone is not indicative of malicious intent.",
