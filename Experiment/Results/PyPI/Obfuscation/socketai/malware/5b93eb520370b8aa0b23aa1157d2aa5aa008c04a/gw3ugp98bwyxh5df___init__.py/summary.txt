  "conclusion": "The dependency contains some obfuscated and dynamically executed code, with signs of potential malicious intent in reports 1 and 5. The overall security risk is moderate to high in these reports, while others are benign. Scores are appropriate, but slight adjustments could be made for nuance. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended for confirmation."
