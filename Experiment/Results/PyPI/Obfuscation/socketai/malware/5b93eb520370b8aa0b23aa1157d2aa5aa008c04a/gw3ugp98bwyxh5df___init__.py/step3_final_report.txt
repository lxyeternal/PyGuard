  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, environment variables, network communication, external modules, user input.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system, system commands, environment variables, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into dynamic execution or network communication sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation (0.6), dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, complex code structure, network activity, suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. Hardcoded secrets and network communication further increase suspicion. Benign code shows standard patterns with no anomalies. The most concerning indicators are in reports 1 and 5, with obfuscation and dynamic execution. The other reports are consistent with benign code. Scores reflect these observations, with higher malware and risk scores in reports 1 and 5, and low scores elsewhere. The scores are justified and align with the detailed reasoning.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains some obfuscated and dynamically executed code, with signs of potential malicious intent in reports 1 and 5. The overall security risk is moderate to high in these reports, while others are benign. Scores are appropriate, but slight adjustments could be made for nuance. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended for confirmation.",
