{
  "purpose": "The code checks for the existence of the 'tahg' directory and, if absent, executes an encoded PowerShell command silently in the background, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; execution of the base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the encoded PowerShell command in a hidden window, which could perform malicious actions such as downloading, executing payloads, or exfiltrating data.",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' directory -> if not exists, run encoded PowerShell command silently in background.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently; silent error handling; execution triggered during setup; obfuscation of payload.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a directory check and conditionally executes an obfuscated PowerShell command in a stealthy manner, indicating malicious intent. The encoded command's purpose is hidden, and execution occurs without user awareness, typical of malicious payloads or backdoors. The silent error handling further conceals activity. The pattern aligns with common supply chain attack tactics, suggesting high suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high likelihood of malicious behavior due to stealthy, obfuscated PowerShell execution based on filesystem state. The suspicious pattern warrants treating this package as high risk, and further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent.",
