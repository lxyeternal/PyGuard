{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with metadata and may attempt to execute hidden PowerShell commands during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem (os.path.exists), environment during setup, and executes a subprocess with encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executes a PowerShell command that is encoded, which could be used to run malicious code or establish a backdoor.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the existence of a directory, then if not present, runs a hidden PowerShell process with encoded commands, potentially executing malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command with -EncodedCommand, hiding execution, and running it without validation or logging; no visible source of trusted input, code structure suggests obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools but then proceeds to conditionally run a hidden PowerShell command using an encoded payload. This command is executed asynchronously without any output handling or validation. The encoding and use of subprocess with hidden window flags are suspicious, as this pattern is commonly used in malicious scripts to run concealed commands. The rest of the setup function is benign, but the initial subprocess call is a significant concern due to its covert nature. The overall code structure suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains potentially malicious behavior by executing a hidden, encoded PowerShell command during setup, likely to perform unauthorized or malicious actions on the host system. The package appears to be intentionally obfuscated and could pose a security risk.",
