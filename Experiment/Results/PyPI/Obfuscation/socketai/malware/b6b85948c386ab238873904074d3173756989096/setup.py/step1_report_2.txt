  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with specific metadata and potentially execute hidden process commands.",
  "sources": "Reads the current directory to check for 'tahg'; executes a PowerShell command if 'tahg' does not exist.",
  "sinks": "Executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen, which can potentially run arbitrary code or payloads.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' -> if not found, runs encoded PowerShell command in background.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window style; silent execution with exception handling. The command is encoded, suggesting an attempt to obfuscate behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code first attempts to import 'subprocess' and 'os', then checks if a directory 'tahg' exists. If not, it runs a base64-encoded PowerShell command in the background, hidden from the user. The PowerShell command is encoded, likely to conceal its purpose, which is suspicious. The setup() function is called with package metadata, which appears benign but is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses errors. The overall structure indicates an attempt to execute hidden or obfuscated code during package setup, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated execution of a PowerShell command without user awareness, indicating malicious intent or sabotage. The setup metadata appears legitimate but is likely a cover for the hidden payload execution. The script's primary suspicious behavior is the silent, encoded PowerShell invocation, which could be used for malicious activities.",
