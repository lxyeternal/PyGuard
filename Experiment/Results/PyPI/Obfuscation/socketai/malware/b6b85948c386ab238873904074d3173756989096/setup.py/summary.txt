  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, strongly indicating malicious intent. The high obfuscation, stealth execution, and conditional trigger are typical of malicious supply chain components. Scores are justified and should be maintained or slightly increased to reflect high confidence in malicious activity."
