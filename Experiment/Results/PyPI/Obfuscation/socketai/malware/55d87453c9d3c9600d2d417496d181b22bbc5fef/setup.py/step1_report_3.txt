{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a Python package setup script with custom installation behavior, possibly for obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, executes decrypted code, and imports external modules such as requests and fernet.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec(), importing requests, and decrypting data suggest potential data exfiltration or malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "During installation, if on Windows, it imports requests and fernet, decrypts a payload, and executes it via exec(), which could lead to malicious activity like remote code execution or data theft.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable naming, presence of encrypted strings, execution of decrypted code with exec(), and the code's obfuscation patterns indicate suspicious behavior. The code decrypts and executes potentially malicious payloads during installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script with a custom install command class. Inside this class, during installation on Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string and executes the decrypted payload dynamically with exec(). The setup configuration specifies a package name, version, and metadata. The use of encrypted strings, dynamic code execution, and conditional behavior on Windows suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activities, such as remote code execution or data exfiltration, during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior characteristic of malicious supply chain components. It decrypts and executes hidden code during installation on Windows, which could be malicious. The obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",
