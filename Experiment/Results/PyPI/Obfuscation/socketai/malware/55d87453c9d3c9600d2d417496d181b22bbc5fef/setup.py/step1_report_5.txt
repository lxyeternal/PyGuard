{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a Python package setup configuration with custom installation behavior that executes embedded decryption and code execution during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'os' module, and the 'exec' function executes decrypted code that is embedded as a byte string inside the Fernet decryption.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec' function executes decrypted code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, including malicious actions such as system manipulation or data theft.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, checking if the OS is Windows, decrypting embedded code with Fernet, and executing it via 'exec'.",
  "anomalies": "The use of encrypted payloads and execution of decrypted code during installation is suspicious. The code is obfuscated through variable names and encoded payloads. The purpose of decrypting and executing code during setup suggests potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'os' and, within a custom 'install' class, checks if the OS is Windows. If so, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from 'cryptography'. It then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted byte string and executes the resulting code with 'exec'. The setup configuration registers this custom class to run during installation. The encrypted payload and the execution of decrypted code indicate obfuscation and potential malicious behavior. The code may be designed to run malicious code on Windows systems during installation, which is a common supply chain attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated logic that decrypts and executes code during package installation, which is suspicious and indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution during setup are common tactics for malicious behavior. Overall, this package appears potentially malicious and should not be trusted.",
