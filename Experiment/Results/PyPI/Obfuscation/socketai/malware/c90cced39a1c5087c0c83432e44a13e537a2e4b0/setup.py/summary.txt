  "conclusion": "The code exhibits extensive obfuscation and performs system modifications, privilege escalation, and package installations, all indicative of malicious activity. The behavior aligns with supply chain sabotage or backdoor deployment. Scores should reflect high malicious potential, with malware and risk scores around 0.9, and obfuscation at nearly 1.0. It should be flagged as malicious and handled with caution."
