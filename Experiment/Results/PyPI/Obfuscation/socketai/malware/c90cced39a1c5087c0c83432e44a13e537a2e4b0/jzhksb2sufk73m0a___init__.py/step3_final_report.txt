  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source dependency based on provided reports, selecting the most accurate and comprehensive, then improving it for clarity and consistency.",
  "sources": "Code patterns indicating dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, untrusted data flows, network activity, and code absence in reports.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, dynamic code execution, and hardcoded credentials.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or code patterns leading to sinks like network transmission or eval/exec execution.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, unvalidated data flows, and inconsistent or absent code evidence.",
  "analysis": "The selected report (Report 1) correctly identifies suspicious behaviors such as dynamic code execution and untrusted data handling, justifying moderate malware (0.4) and security risk (0.6) scores. The reasoning aligns with the scores, which reflect suspicion but lack definitive malicious payloads. Other reports appropriately assign low or zero scores due to lack of code evidence. Minor adjustments include increasing the malware score in Report 1 to 0.6 for better alignment with suspicion level, while maintaining the overall consistency. The evaluation confirms that the scores are reasonable and justified based on the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1 provides a well-founded assessment of moderate suspicion, with scores reflecting the behaviors described. Minor score adjustments improve accuracy. Other reports correctly reflect the absence of evidence, with low or zero scores. Overall, the evaluation demonstrates consistency and appropriate risk assessment.",
