{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform a standard data processing task, involving importing modules, defining functions, and executing main logic related to data handling or computation.",
  "sources": "Input functions or external data sources such as environment variables, user inputs, or file reads (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential output functions like print statements, file writes, network requests, or subprocess calls that could transmit data or affect the system.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources through processing functions to sinks, possibly involving untrusted data reaching sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. Absence of obfuscated code, unusual imports, or dynamic code execution. Any use of insecure functions or data handling would be noted if present.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure indicates typical procedural or modular programming with clear input and output points. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, command execution, or system modification are evident. The code uses standard libraries and follows conventional patterns. Without specific external inputs or detailed function content, no suspicious flows or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. The code appears benign and follows standard coding practices.",
