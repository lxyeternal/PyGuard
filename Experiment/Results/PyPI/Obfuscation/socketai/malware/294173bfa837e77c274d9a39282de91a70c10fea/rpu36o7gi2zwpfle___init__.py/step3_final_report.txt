{
  "purpose": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. It likely serves a utility or configuration role without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input, environment variables, or configuration files, but no explicit sources are identified as suspicious.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network calls, or file writes, but no evidence of untrusted data leading to malicious effects is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to processing functions and then to system or network sinks, but no malicious or suspicious pathways are observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no obfuscation or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and transparent, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) and malware score (0) are justified. The high confidence (0.8) reflects the clarity of the code. The minimal obfuscation score (0) aligns with the code's transparency. Overall, the code poses a low security threat and does not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The security posture is low risk, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
