{
  "purpose": "Decodes a base64-encoded domain, resolves it via DNS during setup, and calls an undefined method 'tesy', indicating potential obfuscation or incomplete malicious code.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded domain string, socket.gethostbyname for DNS resolution",
  "sinks": "DNS resolution of a suspicious domain during installation, call to undefined method 'tesy'",
  "flows": "Decoding base64 -> DNS resolution -> call to 'tesy' method",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for domain, undefined 'tesy' method, DNS resolution during package setup",
  "analysis": "The code performs DNS resolution of a suspicious, obfuscated domain during installation, which could be used for command-and-control or tracking. The method 'tesy' is undefined, suggesting incomplete or intentionally obfuscated code. No payloads or exfiltration are visible, but the obfuscation and DNS activity are suspicious. The malware score should reflect moderate suspicion, considering the obfuscation and DNS activity, but without confirmed malicious payloads, it remains cautious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious obfuscation and DNS resolution of a potentially malicious domain during setup, with an undefined method indicating incomplete or malicious intent. While no direct malicious payload is present, the behavior warrants caution and further investigation.",
