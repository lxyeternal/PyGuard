  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicating malicious intent. The stealth tactics and obfuscation suggest it could be used for payload delivery, persistence, or data exfiltration. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is very high. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious behavior, but current indicators warrant treating this package as malicious."
