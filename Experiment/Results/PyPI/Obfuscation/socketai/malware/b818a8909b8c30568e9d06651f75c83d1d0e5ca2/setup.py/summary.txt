  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior, including remote payload download, persistence via startup folder, and execution, indicative of a supply chain attack vector. The obfuscation and stealth tactics further confirm malicious intent. Scores of malware: 0.9, obfuscated: 0.8, security risk: 0.9 are justified based on the observed behavior."
