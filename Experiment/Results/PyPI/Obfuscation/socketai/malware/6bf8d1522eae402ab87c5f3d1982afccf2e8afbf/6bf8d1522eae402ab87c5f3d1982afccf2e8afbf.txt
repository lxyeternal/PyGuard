      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup, strongly indicating malicious behavior. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified. It should be treated as malicious until further analysis (decoding the PowerShell command) confirms otherwise."
