{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package named 'tynlr94j1yqvujzl' and execute a hidden PowerShell script if a certain directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem to check for the existence of 'tahg' directory and executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command, which could potentially be malicious if the encoded command is harmful.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code runs the encoded PowerShell command. The setup function is standard and does not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded in Base64, which is often used to obfuscate malicious scripts. The command is executed with 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and with hidden window flags. The command itself appears to be obfuscated, likely hiding malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup from distutils, a common package for setup scripts. It then attempts to import subprocess and os modules. If 'tahg' directory does not exist, it executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with hidden window style and an encoded command. The encoding suggests an attempt to conceal the script's true purpose. The setup call is straightforward, specifying package metadata. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, which may hide malicious failures. The encoded PowerShell command should be decoded to analyze its true intent, but the presence of Base64 encoding and execution with 'EncodedCommand' strongly indicates obfuscation and potential malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be benign at first glance but contains obfuscated PowerShell code executed without transparency, which is suspicious. The use of encoded PowerShell commands, hidden execution flags, and error suppression are common tactics in malicious scripts. Without decoding the Base64 command, there is a high risk that it could perform malicious actions such as system modification or data exfiltration.",
