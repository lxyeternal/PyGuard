  "flows": "Directory absence triggers execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded, obfuscated PowerShell command with -WindowStyle Hidden; silent exception handling suppresses errors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a directory check and, if absent, executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command silently, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts to hide payloads. The obfuscation and stealthy execution during setup strongly suggest malicious intent. All reports correctly identify these suspicious behaviors, assigning high malware (~0.85-0.9), obfuscation (~0.8-0.9), and risk (~0.85-0.9) scores. The silent error handling further conceals potential malicious activity. Without decoding the payload, certainty is limited, but the indicators are significant enough to warrant high suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup, strongly indicating malicious behavior. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified. It should be treated as malicious until further analysis (decoding the PowerShell command) confirms otherwise.",
