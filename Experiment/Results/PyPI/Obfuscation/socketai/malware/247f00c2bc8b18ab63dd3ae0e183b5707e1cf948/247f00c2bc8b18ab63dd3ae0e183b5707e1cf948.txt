      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The use of encoding, silent execution, and error suppression are typical of malicious payload delivery. Scores of malware 0.85, obfuscated 0.9, and security risk 0.9 are justified based on these indicators."
