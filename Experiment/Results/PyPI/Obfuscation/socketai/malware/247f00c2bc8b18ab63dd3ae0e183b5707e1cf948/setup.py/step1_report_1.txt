{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, with an embedded payload intended to execute a PowerShell command upon installation.",
  "sources": "File existence check for 'tahg'; subprocess.Popen call with encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess call executing encoded PowerShell command, potentially leading to code execution or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code executes a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen, possibly downloading or executing remote payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command that is executed silently, without clear purpose. The code attempts to run a PowerShell script via encoded command in a hidden window. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, hiding potential issues. The overall intent appears to be clandestine execution during setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities from distutils, then checks for a specific file ('tahg'). If absent, it runs a subprocess executing an encoded PowerShell command with hidden window flags. The encoded command is suspicious, likely obfuscated, designed to evade detection. The code then proceeds to call setup() with package metadata, which is standard, but the prior execution could be malicious. The use of subprocess with encoded commands and silent error suppression suggests an attempt to conceal malicious behavior, such as downloading or executing arbitrary scripts or payloads during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell payload executed during setup, which is suspicious and likely malicious. It appears designed to silently execute an encoded command that could download or run malicious code. The package's primary setup function is overshadowed by the embedded malicious activity, indicating malicious intent.",
