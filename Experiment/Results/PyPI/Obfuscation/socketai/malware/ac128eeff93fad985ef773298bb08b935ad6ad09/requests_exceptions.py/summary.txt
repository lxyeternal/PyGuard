  "conclusion": "The code is primarily obfuscated exception class definitions with no active malicious behavior. The obfuscation and suspicious import alias raise some concern, but no concrete malicious activity is evident. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware risk remains low. Further dynamic or behavioral analysis is recommended if used in sensitive environments."
