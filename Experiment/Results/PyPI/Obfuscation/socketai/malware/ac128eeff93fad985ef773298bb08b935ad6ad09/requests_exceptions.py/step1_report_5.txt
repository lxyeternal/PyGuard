  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling HTTP and JSON decoding errors, with some classes containing obfuscated attributes and strings.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and local compat module; class attributes and initializers reading response and request objects.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization of custom exceptions with response and request objects; no data flow to external sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated class attribute names and string literals; classes with no functional logic or clear purpose. No external calls or data exfiltration mechanisms detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, some inheriting from built-in errors and others from each other. Several classes include obfuscated attribute names and string literals that appear to be placeholders or identifiers. The class `nvsqDAppKZUZQGXRvktfoEdkYiTKVzaV` combines an imported JSON decode error class with a seemingly arbitrary subclass, possibly for error handling. No network activity, data collection, or system manipulation code is present. The obfuscation and minimal logic suggest either placeholder code or intentionally concealed identifiers, but no malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to define custom exception classes with obfuscated attributes and strings but contains no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It likely serves as part of a larger, non-malicious codebase, or is intentionally obfuscated without malicious intent.",
