{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, primarily for HTTP and JSON error handling, with obfuscated class and attribute names and constants.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and a local compat module; class attribute constants with obfuscated strings.",
  "sinks": "No data flow, network calls, or external data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Class definitions and inheritance without active data or control flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and attribute names, use of nonsensical string constants, suspicious import aliasing, and no functional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with obfuscated identifiers and constants, lacking any network activity, data processing, or system modifications. The obfuscation appears intentional, possibly to conceal purpose or hinder static analysis. The suspicious import alias and arbitrary strings in some classes suggest potential covert signaling or backdoor mechanisms, but no active malicious behavior is demonstrated. The high obfuscation score (around 0.8-0.9) is justified, and the absence of evidence for malicious activity supports a low malware score. The overall security risk remains low but warrants caution due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily obfuscated exception class definitions with no active malicious behavior. The obfuscation and suspicious import alias raise some concern, but no concrete malicious activity is evident. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware risk remains low. Further dynamic or behavioral analysis is recommended if used in sensitive environments.",
