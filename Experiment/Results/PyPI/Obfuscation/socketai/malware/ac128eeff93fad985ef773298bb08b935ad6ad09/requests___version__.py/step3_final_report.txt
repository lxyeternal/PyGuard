  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, network calls, system commands, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network transmissions, system modifications, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network endpoints or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected; code is absent or standard.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation, with scores consistently at zero for malware and obfuscation. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal threat levels. Confidence levels vary but are generally high when code is absent or benign. Slight adjustments, such as lowering the security risk score in Report 3 from 0.3 to 0.2, improve consistency with the benign assessment. The overall analysis supports a conclusion of no malicious intent or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Minor score adjustments enhance alignment with the evidence. Overall, the dependency is considered safe based on current information.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0,
