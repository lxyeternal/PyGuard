      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert system info exfiltration via obfuscated network communication. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. The package should be flagged for further investigation or removal due to its malicious exfiltration activity."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily obfuscated exception class definitions with no active malicious behavior. The obfuscation and suspicious import alias raise some concern, but no concrete malicious activity is evident. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware risk remains low. Further dynamic or behavioral analysis is recommended if used in sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated HTTP client library with no direct evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not currently demonstrate malicious intent. The malware score is conservatively set at 0.2, the obfuscated score at 0.75, and the overall security risk at 0.3. Further analysis is recommended if used in supply chain contexts, but based on this review, it does not warrant a high malware or risk score."
