  "flows": "User invokes requests methods -> HTTP requests are sent over the network -> Response objects returned with data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. The code is standard documentation and example usage.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily documentation with example snippets demonstrating the use of the requests library. It includes standard method calls such as requests.get and requests.post, with sample payloads and responses. No obfuscated code, hidden functions, or suspicious network activity is present in the snippets. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious instructions. The content appears to be legitimate documentation and example code for a well-known HTTP library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely informational and example usage of the requests library. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks are detected in the provided snippets.",
