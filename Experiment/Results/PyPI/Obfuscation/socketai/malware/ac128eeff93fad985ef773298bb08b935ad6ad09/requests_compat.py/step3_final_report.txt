{
  "purpose": "The code performs environment detection, dependency fallbacks, and module setup, primarily establishing utility functions and configurations without executing malicious actions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, fallback modules, and environment variables; variable assignments and type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; no network, file, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization and import dependencies without any data flow from untrusted input to critical functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports, obfuscated variable names, conditional import logic, and non-descriptive identifiers; no malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily setup and environment detection code with obfuscated variable names, which could be for obfuscation or anti-reverse engineering. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious functions are present. The obfuscation appears to be a technique to hinder static analysis but does not indicate malicious intent. The code's structure and content are consistent with benign setup code for larger applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as environment and dependency setup with obfuscation techniques. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain sabotage. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is approximately 0.65, and security risk score is around 0.2, reflecting minor suspicion due to obfuscation but no active threat.",
