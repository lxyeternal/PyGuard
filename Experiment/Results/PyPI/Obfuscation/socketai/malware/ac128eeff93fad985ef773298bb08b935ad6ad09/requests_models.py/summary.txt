  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated HTTP client library with no direct evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not currently demonstrate malicious intent. The malware score is conservatively set at 0.2, the obfuscated score at 0.75, and the overall security risk at 0.3. Further analysis is recommended if used in supply chain contexts, but based on this review, it does not warrant a high malware or risk score."
