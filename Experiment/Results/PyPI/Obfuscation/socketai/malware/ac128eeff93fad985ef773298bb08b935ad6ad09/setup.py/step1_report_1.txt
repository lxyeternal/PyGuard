  "anomalies": [
    "Obfuscated and encoded code segment that constructs and sends network traffic",
    "Use of non-standard variable names and obfuscated logic",
    "Encoding and decoding data with XOR and base64 before sending",
    "Network communication to an external IP or server, possibly exfiltrating system info",
    "Silent exception handling that suppresses errors in network code"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code begins with a standard setup for a Python package, including dependency management and reading package metadata. However, a highly suspicious segment occurs later where system information (current directory, user name, hostname) is gathered and obfuscated through XOR operations. This obfuscated data is then base64-encoded, embedded into an HTTP GET request header, and transmitted via a socket connection to an external server. The code's obfuscation, combined with network transmission of system details without user consent, indicates malicious intent, specifically data exfiltration. The try-except block suppresses any errors, making detection more difficult. Overall, the package contains code that secretly transmits system info over the network, which is malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script combines normal package setup code with hidden malicious behavior involving system info collection and covert network communication. The obfuscation and network transmission strongly suggest malicious intent, likely aimed at data theft or system monitoring without user awareness.",
