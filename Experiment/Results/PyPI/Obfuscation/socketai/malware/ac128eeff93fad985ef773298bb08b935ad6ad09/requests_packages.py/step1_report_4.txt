{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs data processing, possibly involving network requests or file operations, but without additional context, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data from user inputs, environment variables, or external files.",
  "sinks": "Potential data output to files, network requests, or printing to console.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions towards sinks, possibly involving external communication or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual variable names or dynamic code execution observed. No malicious comments or hidden code blocks.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries and practices; it reads input data and processes it with functions. No suspicious network activity, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are apparent. The structure and formatting are typical for Python scripts, with no signs of obfuscation. All external library calls are conventional, and no risky patterns such as eval() or exec() are present. Without external context or specific function implementations, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code seems to be a typical Python script with no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
