  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that performs some form of data processing or interaction, but without specific context or comments, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Any input functions, environment variable reads, or file reads that are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Outputs such as print statements, network calls, file writes, or subprocess calls that could transmit data or cause side effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through various processing steps, potentially including data transformations or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, dynamic execution, or obfuscated sections. No obvious anomalies detected from the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for common malicious patterns including data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No suspicious network calls, credential handling, or obfuscated code were found. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic suggest benign intent. Due to lack of specific malicious indicators, the code seems standard but without further context, some caution is advised.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the code provided, there are no evident signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The code appears benign with no high-risk patterns detected.",
