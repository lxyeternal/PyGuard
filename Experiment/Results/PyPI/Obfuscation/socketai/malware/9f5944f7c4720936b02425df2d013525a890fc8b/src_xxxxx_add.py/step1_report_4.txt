{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that increments a given number by 1.",
  "sources": "The code reads nothing; it only defines a function and imports the os module without using it.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present; no output or data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists as no input or output is performed.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual function name 'shqdnwxFvpVvAgstaeQmnRNYDoBRcSeE' appears intentionally obfuscated, and the os module is imported but unused. The function itself is simple and does not perform any malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module but does not utilize it, indicating possible obfuscation or incomplete code. The function has a cryptic name and performs a trivial increment operation. No data input, external data reading, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or malicious side effects. The lack of further context makes it a benign utility function with obfuscated naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent. The obfuscated function name and unused import suggest possible attempt at hiding simplicity, but no malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident.",
