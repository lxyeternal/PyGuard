{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that increments a number by 1.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'number' parameter passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "The function returns the incremented number; no external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement after incrementing.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated, but there are no suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module but does not utilize it anywhere, indicating unnecessary import. The function itself is straightforward, with no input validation, external data access, or potentially dangerous operations. The obfuscated function name could be intended to conceal purpose but does not perform any malicious activity. There are no signs of data leaks, code injection, or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, a simple increment function with no malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscated name is suspicious but does not indicate malicious activity on its own.",
