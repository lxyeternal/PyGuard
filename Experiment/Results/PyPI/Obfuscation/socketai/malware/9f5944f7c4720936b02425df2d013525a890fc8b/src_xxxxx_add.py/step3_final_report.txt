{
  "purpose": "This code defines a trivial function that increments a number by 1, with an unused import and an obfuscated function name. It appears to serve as a placeholder or obfuscated code snippet with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The function parameter 'number' as input source.",
  "sinks": "The function output 'number + 1' as a safe, benign operation; no sinks for untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly into the addition operation, producing the output; no external data flows or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name 'shqdnwxFvpVvAgstaeQmnRNYDoBRcSeE' and the unused 'os' import are anomalies indicating obfuscation but not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple increment operation with an obfuscated name and an unused import. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The obfuscation is superficial, likely for concealment or placeholder purposes. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the security risk is minimal. The obfuscation score is moderate, reflecting suspicion but no evidence of malicious intent. The overall security posture is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with superficial obfuscation and no malicious activity detected. The scores are consistent with its simplicity and lack of malicious behavior. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
