{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that increments a number by one.",
  "sources": "The function takes an input parameter 'number'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows through the function to produce 'number + 1'.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated and meaningless; the import of 'os' is unused and suspicious, suggesting potential obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module but does not use it, which could indicate hiding malicious intent or an attempt to include unnecessary dependencies. The function name 'shqdnwxFvpVvAgstaeQmnRNYDoBRcSeE' is nonsensical and obfuscated, a common tactic in malicious code to avoid detection. The function itself simply increments a number, which is benign, but the obfuscated naming and unused import raise suspicion. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious behaviors are directly evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears largely benign but contains signs of obfuscation, such as an unnecessary import and a nonsensical function name, which could be used to hide malicious intent or further malicious code elsewhere. No malicious activity is directly observable in this fragment.",
