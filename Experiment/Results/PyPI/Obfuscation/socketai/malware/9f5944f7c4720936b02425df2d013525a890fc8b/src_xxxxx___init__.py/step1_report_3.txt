{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a simple function that adds 2 to its input, likely intended for mathematical or utility purposes.",
  "sources": "The only input source is the function parameter 'x', which is an external input to the function.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or other data exfiltration points. The code does perform a simple addition operation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input parameter 'x' through the function and returns 'x + 2'. No external data or untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code constructs. The import statement for 'os' is unused, which is a minor anomaly but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module but does not use it. It defines a function with an obfuscated name that performs a basic addition operation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The presence of an unused import suggests the code may be incomplete or intentionally obfuscated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple mathematical function with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The unused import and obfuscated function name are minor anomalies but do not indicate malicious activity.",
