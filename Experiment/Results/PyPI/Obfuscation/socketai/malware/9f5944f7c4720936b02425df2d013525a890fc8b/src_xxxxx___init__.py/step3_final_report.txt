  "purpose": "A simple function that adds 2 to its input, with unused imports and an obfuscated name.",
  "sources": "Function parameter 'x'; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input 'x' flows directly into the return statement; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Unused imports ('os' and 'add'), obfuscated function name, no usage of imported modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward addition function with minor anomalies such as unused imports and an obfuscated name. No malicious behavior, external data flow, or security vulnerabilities are present. The obfuscation and unused imports are minor and do not indicate malicious intent but could suggest code concealment or incomplete implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The anomalies are minor and do not elevate the threat level. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low.",
