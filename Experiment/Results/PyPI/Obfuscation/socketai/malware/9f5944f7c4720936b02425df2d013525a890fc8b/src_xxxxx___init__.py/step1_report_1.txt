{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that adds 2 to its input.",
  "sources": "No input sources such as user input, environment variables, or external data are present.",
  "sinks": "No output or data transmission functions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the function operates solely on its parameter.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes an import of a local module 'add', but this imported module is not used within the provided code snippet. The function name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could suggest an attempt to evade detection, but there is no malicious behavior evident in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'add' but does not utilize it. The function 'edfUBmHpFFWKOMhkvjkflNQHBaZaePAV' is straightforward, returning the input plus 2. No external data sources, sensitive data handling, or network communications are present. The function's obfuscated name alone does not indicate malicious intent, especially in the absence of suspicious code execution or data exfiltration. Overall, the code appears benign and intentionally minimal.",
  "conclusion": "This code is simple, benign, and does not contain any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable aspect is the obfuscated function name and an unused import, which alone do not pose security threats.",
