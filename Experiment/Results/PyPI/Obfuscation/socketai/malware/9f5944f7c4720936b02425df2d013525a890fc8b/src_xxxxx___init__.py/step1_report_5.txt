{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that adds 2 to its input, likely intended for basic arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data; it only defines a function and imports a module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks, such as data output or external system interactions, in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function operates on its input parameter only.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious. The import statement uses a relative import, which is typical in packages but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module and defines a function with a seemingly random name that simply returns its input plus two. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious side effects. The obfuscated function name could suggest intent to hide behavior, but as implemented, it is harmless. No other anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, simple arithmetic function with an obfuscated name. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
