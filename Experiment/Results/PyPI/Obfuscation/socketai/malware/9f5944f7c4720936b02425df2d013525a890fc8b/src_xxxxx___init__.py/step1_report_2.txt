{
  "purpose": "This code defines a simple function that adds 2 to its input and imports a local module named 'add'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the environment via 'import os' and from the local module 'add'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The function 'edfUBmHpFFWKOMhkvjkflNQHBaZaePAV' takes input and performs addition; no external data flows or untrusted inputs are processed.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated or intentionally obscure; the imported module 'add' is not used in this fragment, which could be suspicious if considered in a larger context. The import of 'os' is unused, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing 'os' but not using it, and importing a local module 'add' without using it. The function's name appears obfuscated, which can be a sign of attempts to hide intent. There are no evident malicious actions such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection. The code structure is straightforward, and no malicious behavior or malicious payloads are observable within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign; it performs a simple arithmetic operation and has no active malicious or suspicious behavior. The obfuscated function name and unused imports are minor anomalies but do not indicate malicious intent.",
