  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, or external files (exact sources not specified in the code snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential output functions, network communication, or file writes where untrusted data could be misused.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, but exact paths are unclear due to limited code provided.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python features, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or system modifications. There are no evident hardcoded secrets or suspicious obfuscated segments. Usage of third-party libraries appears benign, and the code structure is straightforward. Lack of context prevents a comprehensive source-to-sink flow analysis, but no immediate security risks are visible.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The code appears benign, with no suspicious activity or anomalies detected.",
