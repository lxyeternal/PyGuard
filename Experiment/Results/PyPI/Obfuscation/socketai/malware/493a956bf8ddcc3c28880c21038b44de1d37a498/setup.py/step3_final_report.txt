{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that contains malicious activities on Windows systems, including downloading remote files from suspicious IP addresses, executing them, performing privilege checks, and system modifications. The obfuscated variable names and network activity strongly suggest malicious intent, likely establishing backdoors or executing malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__version__.py', dependencies list, system environment variables, and network content via 'requests.get'.",
  "sinks": "Writes downloaded files to disk ('local_copy.txt', 'local_b.txt'), executes remote files via subprocess calls, moves/deletes files, and performs privilege checks with 'net session'.",
  "flows": "Source points include remote URL fetches and environment variables; flows lead to writing files, executing downloaded content, and system modifications; network activity from hardcoded IPs to download and execute remote payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, hardcoded IP addresses, URLs, use of 'shell=True' in subprocess calls, downloading and executing remote files, privilege escalation attempts, and system modifications all indicate malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script performs version checks, dependency declarations, and package setup tasks. On Windows, it retrieves the temp directory, attempts to install 'requests' if missing, then downloads files from specific IPs ('52.14.229.35') from URLs like '/connect-CANDC.txt' and '/shoomsha.jpg'. It writes these files locally with suspicious filenames, then executes them via 'cmd /c'. It moves files, deletes temporary files, and checks for administrative privileges using 'net session'. The network activity and remote execution are characteristic of malware or backdoors. The obfuscated variable names and indirect subprocess calls further suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including remote payload download, execution, privilege escalation, and system modifications. The obfuscation and network activity from suspicious IPs confirm its malicious nature. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware score should be set to 1.0. The obfuscation score is justified at 0.8 due to the obfuscated variable names and indirect calls. The security risk score is justified at 0.9, reflecting the high threat level.",
