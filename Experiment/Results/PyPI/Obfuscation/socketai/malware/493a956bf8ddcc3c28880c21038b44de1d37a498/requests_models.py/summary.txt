  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated HTTP utility library with no explicit malicious behavior detected within this fragment. The high level of obfuscation raises suspicion but does not constitute evidence of malware. The scores are consistent with this assessment: low malware risk (~0.1-0.2), high obfuscation (~0.75), and low security risk (~0.2). Further static analysis or runtime monitoring is recommended if used in production to ensure no hidden payloads."
