  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated implementation of internal data structures with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation scores are justified, and the low security risk reflects the absence of external or harmful operations. The malware score remains at 0, indicating no malicious activity detected."
