  "conclusion": "The code snippets are standard 'requests' library examples with obfuscated variable and function names, likely placeholders or obfuscation artifacts. There is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains at 0, indicating no malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low. These snippets are benign but should be reviewed in context if embedded in larger codebases."
