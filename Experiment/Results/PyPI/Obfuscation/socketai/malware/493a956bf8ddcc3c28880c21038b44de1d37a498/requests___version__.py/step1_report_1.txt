  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a specific function or task, but due to the absence of visible code content, the exact purpose cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include user input, environment variables, or data read from files or network connections. However, no explicit data sources are visible in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Possible sinks could be output functions, network transmission points, or file writes. No direct sink points are identifiable without specific code details.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows due to the lack of visible code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are evident in the provided snippet. The code is empty or not provided.",
  "analysis": "The provided input contains no code to analyze. Without code, no sources, sinks, or potential malicious behaviors can be identified. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detectable in an empty or absent code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code either was not provided or is empty, resulting in no suspicious activity detected.",
