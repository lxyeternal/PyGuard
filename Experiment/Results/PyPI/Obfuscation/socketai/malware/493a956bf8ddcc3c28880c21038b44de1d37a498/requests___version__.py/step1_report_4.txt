  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or computation, potentially involving input and output operations. Specific details are unclear without actual code.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, or external data files (if present), typically at the start of code.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous functions such as network calls, system commands, or data storage operations, especially if involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs), possibly passing through transformation functions or conditional logic.",
  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic code execution, or unexplained network connections would be anomalies. As no code is provided, cannot specify.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis is limited due to absence of actual code. Generally, review involves checking for hardcoded secrets, unsafe data handling, suspicious external communications, or obfuscated sections. No specific patterns detected here.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of provided code, no malicious behavior can be identified. There are no clear signs of malware, suspicious data flows, or anomalies. The code appears benign, pending further details.",
