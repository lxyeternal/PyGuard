  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated compatibility layer for cookie management, with no direct evidence of malicious activity. While the obfuscation raises suspicion and warrants further manual review, the current evidence suggests a low likelihood of malware. The scores assigned are appropriate, but caution should be maintained, and further review of the entire package is recommended to ensure no hidden payloads."
