      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including remote payload download, execution, privilege escalation, and system modifications. The obfuscation and network activity from suspicious IPs confirm its malicious nature. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware score should be set to 1.0. The obfuscation score is justified at 0.8 due to the obfuscated variable names and indirect calls. The security risk score is justified at 0.9, reflecting the high threat level."

      "conclusion": "The code fragment does not contain malicious behavior or active security threats. The embedded strings are likely placeholders or obfuscation, not malicious payloads. Malware is absent; obfuscation is moderate to high but not indicative of malicious intent. The security risk is low. No immediate action is necessary, but the obfuscated content should be reviewed in the context of the full package."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with static strings and unusual naming, raising suspicion. However, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity within this fragment. The low malware score reflects this, but the high obfuscation score indicates caution. Further analysis of how these classes are used in the larger codebase is recommended to determine if obfuscation is masking malicious intent."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated HTTP utility library with no explicit malicious behavior detected within this fragment. The high level of obfuscation raises suspicion but does not constitute evidence of malware. The scores are consistent with this assessment: low malware risk (~0.1-0.2), high obfuscation (~0.75), and low security risk (~0.2). Further static analysis or runtime monitoring is recommended if used in production to ensure no hidden payloads."

      "confidence": 0.7,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated compatibility layer for cookie management, with no direct evidence of malicious activity. While the obfuscation raises suspicion and warrants further manual review, the current evidence suggests a low likelihood of malware. The scores assigned are appropriate, but caution should be maintained, and further review of the entire package is recommended to ensure no hidden payloads."

      "conclusion": "The code snippets are standard 'requests' library examples with obfuscated variable and function names, likely placeholders or obfuscation artifacts. There is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains at 0, indicating no malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low. These snippets are benign but should be reviewed in context if embedded in larger codebases."

The high obfuscation scores are justified, and the low security risk reflects the absence of external or harmful operations. The malware score remains at 0, indicating no malicious activity detected."

      "conclusion": "Most reports are accurate in their assessments. Report 5 warrants caution due to use of dynamic code execution and obfuscation, justifying higher malware and obfuscation scores. Overall, the scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence; further code review of Report 5 is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
