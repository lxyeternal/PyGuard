{
  "purpose": "The code performs environment detection, module imports, and type aliasing, primarily serving as setup code with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, module import statements, environment checks, type alias assignments",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, or data leaks are present",
  "flows": "Environment info from sys.version_info to version checks; import statements to module usage; variable assignments to subsequent code (not shown)",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, superficial obfuscation, no malicious code or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly environment setup with fallback imports and type definitions. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated but do not serve malicious purposes. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution of untrusted inputs is detected. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment but not malicious. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), with high confidence that the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign environment setup code with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats in this fragment.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "malware": 0,
