{
  "purpose": "The script appears to gather files in the current directory, send them via Telegram, and log filenames to a text file. Its purpose might be file exfiltration or reconnaissance.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() for directory contents, open() for reading files, os.system() for installing packages",
  "sinks": "requests.post() for sending data to external URLs, open() for file reading and writing",
  "flows": "Directory listing -> file reading -> requests.post() to send files -> filename logging to SIN.txt",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, sending files over network without user consent, attempting to install packages silently, use of obfuscated variable names, and no clear legitimate functionality",
  "analysis": "The code starts by attempting to import modules and install them if missing, indicating potential obfuscation. It hardcodes a Telegram bot token and chat ID, which are used to send messages and documents. The script lists files in the current directory, prints filenames, and sends each file to a Telegram chat as a document. It logs filenames to a local text file. The use of requests.post() with Telegram API endpoints suggests data exfiltration. The code's structure and variable names are obfuscated, and the purpose aligns with potential malicious activity like file theft or reconnaissance. There is no evidence of legitimate use, and the script acts stealthily by installing dependencies and silently exfiltrating data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect local files and send them to an external entity via Telegram, indicating malicious intent related to data exfiltration. Its obfuscated structure and hardcoded credentials further support a malicious purpose. It should be considered malicious with high confidence.",
