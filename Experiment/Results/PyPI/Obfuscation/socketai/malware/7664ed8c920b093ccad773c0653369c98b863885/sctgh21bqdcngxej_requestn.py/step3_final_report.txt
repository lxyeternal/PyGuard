{
  "purpose": "The script enumerates files in the current directory, prints filenames, and exfiltrates each file via Telegram API using hardcoded credentials, while logging filenames locally. It also attempts to install standard modules unnecessarily, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() for directory listing; hardcoded token and chat ID; open() for reading files; requests.post() for network transmission.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() calls to Telegram API endpoints; open() for reading files; writing filenames to SIN.txt.",
  "flows": "os.listdir() -> iteration over files -> open() -> requests.post() to send files -> logging filenames to SIN.txt.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram token and chat ID; unnecessary installation of 'webbrowser' and 'socket' modules via os.system(); minimal obfuscation with non-descriptive variable names; no input validation or error handling; silent exfiltration of files.",
  "analysis": "The code lists directory files, prints filenames, and exfiltrates each file to a Telegram bot using hardcoded credentials, indicating malicious data theft. It logs filenames locally and attempts to install modules unnecessarily, which are standard modules but installed via pip, raising suspicion. Variable names are non-descriptive, and there is no validation or error handling, increasing malicious profile. The network activity and hardcoded secrets strongly suggest covert exfiltration. The code’s behavior aligns with malware, with high potential for unauthorized data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a malicious data exfiltration tool, silently collecting and transmitting files via Telegram with hardcoded credentials, minimal obfuscation, and no user consent. It poses a high security threat, justifying high malware and risk scores.",
