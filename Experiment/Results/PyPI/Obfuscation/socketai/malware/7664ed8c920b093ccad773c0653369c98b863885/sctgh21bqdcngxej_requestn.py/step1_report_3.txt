{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect files from the current directory, log their filenames, and send them via Telegram using a bot, potentially for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads directory contents with os.listdir() and opens files for reading when sending documents via requests.post().",
  "sinks": "Sends messages and files over the network using requests.post() to Telegram API endpoints, with potentially sensitive data being exfiltrated.",
  "flows": "Collects filenames -> logs filenames -> sends files to Telegram -> logs filenames to SIN.txt.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded Telegram bot tokens and chat IDs, attempts to install modules dynamically, and does not handle exceptions properly. The code also sends files from the local directory without user consent. The variable names are obfuscated and non-descriptive. The presence of Telegram API usage with hardcoded tokens indicates potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes hardcoded tokens and IDs, then lists directory files. For each file, it logs the filename, then attempts to send the file to a Telegram bot via requests.post(). It also logs filenames into SIN.txt. The installation commands for modules like 'webbrowser' and 'socket' are redundant and unlikely to succeed since these are standard modules. The code leaks files by uploading them to a Telegram chat, indicating data exfiltration behavior. The obfuscation of variable names and lack of comments suggest concealment. No legitimate user activity or benign purpose is evident; the behavior aligns with data theft or malicious surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting local files and exfiltrating them via Telegram, using hardcoded credentials, and obfuscated variable names. It is likely intended for unauthorized data collection and transfer. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score indicates likely malicious intent.",
