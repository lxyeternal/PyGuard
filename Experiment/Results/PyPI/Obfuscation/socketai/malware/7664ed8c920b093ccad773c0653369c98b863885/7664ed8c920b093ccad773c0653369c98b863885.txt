      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only minor concern is unprofessional author info, which does not constitute a security risk. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with the minor security risk score in one report overstated. The appropriate scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a malicious data exfiltration tool, silently collecting and transmitting files via Telegram with hardcoded credentials, minimal obfuscation, and no user consent. It poses a high security threat, justifying high malware and risk scores."

      "confidence": 0.6,
      "conclusion": "The import statement is minimal and not inherently malicious, but the obfuscated naming pattern warrants caution. Further analysis of the 'requestn' module is recommended to determine if it contains malicious code or obfuscated payloads. The current scores are consistent with the evidence, with low malware risk and high suspicion of obfuscation. No definitive malicious activity is demonstrated in this snippet."
