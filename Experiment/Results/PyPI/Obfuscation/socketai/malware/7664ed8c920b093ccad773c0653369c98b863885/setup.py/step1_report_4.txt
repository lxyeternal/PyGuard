  "purpose": "Configure and set up the Python package named 'requestn' for distribution.",
  "sources": "User input via the setup() function parameters: name, version, author, description, packages, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs detected.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data to dangerous sinks; setup parameters are static strings.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of suspicious or unprofessional author information ('Programmer Golden', '@rrrrrf'), but no malicious code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and classifiers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The author info may be suspiciously informal, but it does not indicate malicious intent. No code execution, dynamic imports, or sensitive data handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The only point of note is potentially unprofessional author information, but it does not pose security risks.",
