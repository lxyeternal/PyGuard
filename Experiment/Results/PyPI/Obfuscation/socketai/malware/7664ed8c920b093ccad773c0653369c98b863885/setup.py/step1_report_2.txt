  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'requestn'.",
  "sources": "Static code defining package metadata; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A - static setup code with no data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be standard package setup without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and uses it to configure package setup parameters, including name, version, author, description, packages, and classifiers. The description includes a Telegram handle '@rrrrrf', which could be for contact or attribution but does not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package distribution. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. No hardcoded credentials, malicious commands, or external network activity are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
