  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package named 'requestn' for distribution.",
  "sources": "User input is minimal; primarily reading static strings for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data affects system security or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "N/A — static setup call, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Author name and description contain suspicious or unprofessional content ('Programmer Golden', 'By Golden In telegram @rrrrrf'), but these are not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata and find packages. No dynamic execution, no obfuscated code, no external network calls. The author information appears potentially unprofessional but not malicious. No security risks or malicious behavior detected based on this setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be a benign package configuration.",
