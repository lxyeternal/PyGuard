  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'requestn' Python library with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields: name, version, author, description, packages, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, user input, or network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Unprofessional author string 'Programmer Golden ' with trailing space; description includes Telegram handle '@rrrrrf'. No malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script with static metadata. No dynamic code, external inputs, or network activity. The author info and description are unprofessional but do not indicate malicious intent. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate. The small security risk score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified given the benign nature of the code; it should be lowered to 0. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only minor concern is unprofessional author info, which does not constitute a security risk. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with the minor security risk score in one report overstated. The appropriate scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
