  "conclusion": "The import statement is minimal and not inherently malicious, but the obfuscated naming pattern warrants caution. Further analysis of the 'requestn' module is recommended to determine if it contains malicious code or obfuscated payloads. The current scores are consistent with the evidence, with low malware risk and high suspicion of obfuscation. No definitive malicious activity is demonstrated in this snippet."
