  "purpose": "The code attempts to set up a Python package and execute a hidden PowerShell command if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "Checks for existence of 'tahg' directory; executes subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing a PowerShell command with encoded payload.",
  "flows": "Presence of 'tahg' directory -> triggers execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command used with 'powershell -EncodedCommand' suggests obfuscation; use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide execution; silent exception handling hides errors.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing 'setup' from distutils.core, then checks if 'tahg' directory exists. If not, it attempts to run a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64, likely to perform additional actions without user detection. The command is run asynchronously and without visible window, which is typical of malicious or stealth operations. The setup function is called with package metadata, wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, preventing detection of setup failures. The presence of an encoded command and silent error handling are suspicious behaviors, indicating possible malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior through the use of encoded PowerShell payloads and hidden execution, indicating potential malicious intent or covert operations. The overall setup process appears normal, but the embedded payload and execution tactics warrant suspicion. The code likely attempts to run hidden commands that could perform malicious activities.",
