      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious, potentially malicious behavior through obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution conditioned on filesystem state. The use of encoded commands and hidden process creation strongly indicates malicious intent. The silent error handling further obscures activity. Scores should reflect high suspicion, with malware and risk scores around 0.8, consistent with the behavior."
