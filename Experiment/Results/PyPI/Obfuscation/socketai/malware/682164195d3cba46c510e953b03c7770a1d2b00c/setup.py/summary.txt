  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution conditioned on a filesystem check. The stealth techniques and obfuscation are typical of malicious payloads in supply chain attacks. The high malware and security risk scores are appropriate; further decoding of the payload is recommended for confirmation."
