      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to stealthy, obfuscated execution of a PowerShell command during package setup. While the actual payload remains unknown without decoding, the pattern aligns with malicious behavior. The high scores are justified, and further decoding is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
