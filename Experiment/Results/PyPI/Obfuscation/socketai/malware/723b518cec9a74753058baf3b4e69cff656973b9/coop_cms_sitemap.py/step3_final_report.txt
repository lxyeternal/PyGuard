  "purpose": "Generate sitemaps for a Django project, supporting localization and article content, with URL resolution and site settings.",
  "sources": "Database models (Site, SiteSettings, article class), external functions (get_article_class, is_localized), URL patterns, localization activation.",
  "sinks": "URL generation via reverse(), site and article queries, localization activation.",
  "flows": "Site and article data retrieved from database -> URL resolution with reverse() -> optional localization activation -> sitemap URL list generated.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'django.core.urlresolvers' import; no obfuscation or secrets; standard Django practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django sitemap implementation with localization support. It uses database models to fetch site and article data, dynamically generates URLs, and supports localization via activate(). No external untrusted input is processed directly, and no malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The deprecated import indicates legacy code but not malicious intent. The code structure is clear, and external functions are assumed safe. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are detected. The localization function 'activate()' is standard but could have side effects if misused; here, it is used appropriately. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and follows best practices, with minor outdated patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of Django sitemaps with localization support. No malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The only concern is the outdated import style, which does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to outdated practices but not security vulnerabilities.",
