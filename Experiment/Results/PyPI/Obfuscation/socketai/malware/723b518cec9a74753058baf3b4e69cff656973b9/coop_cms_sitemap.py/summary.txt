  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of Django sitemaps with localization support. No malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The only concern is the outdated import style, which does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to outdated practices but not security vulnerabilities."
