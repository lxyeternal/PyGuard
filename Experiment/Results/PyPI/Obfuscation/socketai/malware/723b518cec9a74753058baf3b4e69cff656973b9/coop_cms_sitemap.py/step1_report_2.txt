  "purpose": "Generate XML sitemaps for a Django website, including localized and article-specific sitemaps.",
  "sources": "User or external configuration influences language selection, site settings, and URL reversing.",
  "sinks": "The code uses reverse() for URL generation and accesses database models; no direct sinks for untrusted input detected.",
  "flows": "Language setting influences URL localization; site settings determine sitemap mode; URL generation for sitemaps and articles.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. Usage of deprecated django.conf.urls.patterns, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines sitemap classes that fetch data from the database and generate URLs for the sitemap. It handles localization via activate(), retrieves site info, and dynamically builds sitemap items. The URL patterns correctly route to the sitemap view. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The usage of reverse() and database queries is standard. The code appears to be a typical Django sitemap implementation with localization support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django sitemap generator with support for localization and articles. No malicious behavior or security risks identified. The code is well-structured and does not contain suspicious anomalies.",
