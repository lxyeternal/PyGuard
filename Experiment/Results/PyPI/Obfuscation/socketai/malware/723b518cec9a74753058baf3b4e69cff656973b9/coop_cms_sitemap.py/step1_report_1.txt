  "purpose": "Generate sitemaps for a Django website, including localized and article-specific sitemaps.",
  "sources": "django.conf.settings (settings.LANGUAGES, settings.SITE_ID), django.conf.urls (url), django.contrib.sitemaps.Sitemap, django.contrib.sites.models.Site, coop_cms.models (BaseArticle, SiteSettings), coop_cms.settings (get_article_class, is_localized), reverse (URL resolution), activate (localization)",
  "sinks": "reverse() function in ViewSitemap.items() for URL generation, activate() for localization, django.contrib.sitemaps.views.sitemap URL view for serving sitemap",
  "flows": "get_sitemaps() generates sitemaps which are then used in URL pattern; ViewSitemap uses reverse() to generate URLs; location() activates language based on self.language; get_urls() gathers URLs from site(s) based on sitemap mode",
  "anomalies": "Use of activate() from django.utils.translation without sanitization, but this is standard Django behavior; no hardcoded secrets or credentials found; no unusual code patterns; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code generates sitemaps using Django's standard mechanisms. It dynamically constructs URLs via reverse() based on view names, which are provided in view_names. The get_sitemaps() function handles localization by dynamically creating sitemap instances per language. The activate() call adjusts language context. No user input is directly used to construct critical data; URL resolution is standard and safe. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code adheres to typical Django practices with no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of Django sitemaps with localization support. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified. It uses standard Django features appropriately, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
