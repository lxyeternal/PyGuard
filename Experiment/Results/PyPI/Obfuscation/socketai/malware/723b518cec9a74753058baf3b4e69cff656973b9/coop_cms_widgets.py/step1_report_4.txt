{
  "purpose": "Defines custom Django form widgets for admin interface enhancements, including read-only inputs, image editing, chosen.js-based select widgets, and a raw ID widget for generic relations.",
  "sources": "Reading template files ('coop_cms/widgets/readonlyinput.html', 'coop_cms/widgets/imageedit.html', 'coop_cms/widgets/chosen.html'), accessing NavType model data, retrieving text via get_text_from_template, reverse URL resolution, and accessing instance.content_type and instance.object_id.",
  "sinks": "Render methods that generate HTML, including embedded URLs and labels; get_nav_types_url_html creates HTML with navigation URLs; label_for_value fetches model data based on instance attributes.",
  "flows": "Template and HTML rendering flow involves embedding URLs and labels into the output. No direct untrusted data flow to system commands or network connections observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of get_text_from_template may involve dynamic content; no hardcoded credentials, malicious obfuscation, or suspicious external code execution detected. No evidence of data leaks or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles widget rendering and UI-related HTML generation. It dynamically constructs URLs and labels based on model data, and updates context with external templates and static assets. No user input is directly processed or executed. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, code injection, or backdoors. All URL and label generation appears to be based on model data and static resources. The code is well-structured for a Django admin widget extension, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard Django widget customization without malicious intent or security risks. It focuses on rendering UI components with dynamic data, using safe practices. No malicious or malicious-suspicious behavior detected.",
