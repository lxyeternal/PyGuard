{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom Django form widgets for a CMS, including read-only inputs, image editing, chosen select widgets, and a raw ID widget for referencing model instances via URLs. It facilitates rendering and interaction within the admin interface.",
  "sources": "Model data from NavType objects, URL reversals for admin changelists, and template rendering functions such as get_text_from_template.",
  "sinks": "HTML output via mark_safe, URL links in HTML, and JavaScript hooks for widget behavior.",
  "flows": "Data flows from NavType model queries and URL reversals into HTML snippets generated with mark_safe, which are then rendered in the admin interface.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious external code. The use of mark_safe with model data could pose XSS risk if data is malicious, but as data originates from trusted database entries, this is minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Django widget patterns, querying models and generating URLs for admin interfaces. The use of get_text_from_template and mark_safe is controlled and typical for rendering dynamic HTML. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external network activity is present. The risk primarily hinges on the trustworthiness of database data; otherwise, the code is straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Django admin widgets with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score of 0.2 is justified given the controlled data sources and safe practices. Overall, the supply chain security risk for this code is minimal.",
