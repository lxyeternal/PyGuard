  "sinks": "Return statement in get_version(), assignment to __version__",
  "flows": "VERSION tuple -> get_version() -> __version__",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, no suspicious imports or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a version tuple, formats it into a string in get_version(), and assigns it to __version__. There are no external data inputs, no code execution based on untrusted data, no network operations, and no malicious behavior. The code appears standard for version management in a Python package. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a typical versioning module in a Python package, with no suspicious or harmful elements.",
