  "purpose": "Define and expose the version information of the coop_cms package for Django.",
  "sources": "The VERSION tuple and the get_version() function, which constructs a version string from the tuple.",
  "sinks": "Return statement in get_version() that outputs the version string.",
  "flows": "The VERSION tuple is read by get_version(), which then returns a formatted string containing the version number.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and only involves version string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version tuple, defines a function to format and return this version as a string, and assigns this to __version__. There are no inputs from external sources, no handling of untrusted data, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or secret data management observed. The code appears to be standard package version management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign version info module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
