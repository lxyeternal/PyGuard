  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version management module.\n   - The code consists of a version tuple, a function to format this tuple into a string, and an assignment to `__version__`.\n   - There are no external inputs, network calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation**:\n   - No reports detect any obfuscated code, suspicious imports, or malicious patterns.\n   - The code is static, simple, and standard for package versioning.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Risks**:\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that there are no security risks.\n   - Given the code's simplicity, this is appropriate.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious behavior are identified.\n\n4. **Scores**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Confidence scores are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty in the benign nature.\n\n**Critical Evaluation & Recommendations**:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes are necessary; the code is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is a standard versioning module with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
