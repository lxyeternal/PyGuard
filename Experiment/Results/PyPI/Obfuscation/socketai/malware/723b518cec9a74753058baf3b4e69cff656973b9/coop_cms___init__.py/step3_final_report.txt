  "purpose": "Defines and exposes the version information for the Python package.",
  "sources": "The static VERSION tuple, used within get_version() to generate version string.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or external inputs are present.",
  "flows": "The VERSION tuple is formatted by get_version() into a string assigned to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static, straightforward, and standard for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a static version tuple, formats it into a string via get_version(), and assigns it to __version__. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, suspicious imports, or malicious patterns are present. The purpose is solely to define package version info. The logic is correct, simple, and standard. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version management snippet with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications or further security considerations are necessary.",
