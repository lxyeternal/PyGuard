  "purpose": "Define and expose the version number for the coop_cms Django application.",
  "sources": "The VERSION tuple, the get_version() function, and the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not interact with external inputs or untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "The VERSION tuple is used within get_version() to generate a version string, assigned to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static version tuple and a simple function to format it into a string. It assigns this string to __version__, which is a common practice in Python packages. There are no sources of untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for versioning in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version definition module with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply manages the application's version number.",
