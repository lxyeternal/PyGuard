  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version management snippet. The code only defines a version tuple, a function to format it, and assigns it to `__version__`. There are no dynamic inputs, no external data handling, and no suspicious behavior. No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of anomalies, malicious patterns, or obfuscation. No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident. They also appropriately conclude that the code is benign.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the analysis that there are no security concerns.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores**  \nSince the code is purely static version info with no external dependencies, no user input, and no suspicious activity, higher scores are unjustified. The current scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNo reports make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nThe scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. They accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard version management snippet with no security risks or malicious intent.**",
