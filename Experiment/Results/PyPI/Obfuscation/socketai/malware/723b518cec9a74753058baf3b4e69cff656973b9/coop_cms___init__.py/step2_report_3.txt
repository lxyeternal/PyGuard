  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Verification:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple version management module: a static tuple, a formatting function, and an assignment to `__version__`. There are no dynamic inputs, no external data handling, and no network activity. The code is straightforward and standard for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0  \n   - `obfuscated`: 0  \n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)  \n   \n   These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code. The scores align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**  \n   Since the code is purely static version information with no external data handling or suspicious activity, higher risk scores are unwarranted. The current scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**  \n   The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports, as there's no malicious activity or code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard version management.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**  \n- The code is benign, standard version info code.  \n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements are present.  \n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just to reflect that it's a version module, but it's standard and safe)\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo changes are necessary. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.",
