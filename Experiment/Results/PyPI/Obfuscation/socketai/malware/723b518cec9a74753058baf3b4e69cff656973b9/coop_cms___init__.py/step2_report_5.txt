  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the underlying code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines a static version tuple (`VERSION = (1, 2, 26)`).\n- It provides a function `get_version()` that formats this tuple into a string.\n- It assigns this string to `__version__`.\n- It sets a Django app config variable.\n\n**Security and Malicious Behavior Assessment:**\n- The code is entirely static, with no user input, network activity, or dynamic data handling.\n- No obfuscated code, no suspicious imports, no external data sources.\n- The logic is straightforward: define version info and expose it.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n**Analysis of Reports:**\n- All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for version management.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n- The reports do not identify any issues with the code.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard version declaration module.\n- No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.\n- The reports' conclusions are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is entirely benign and serves a typical purpose in Python packages.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious elements. The reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
