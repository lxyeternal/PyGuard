  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, involving only static version information, a simple function to format the version string, and assignment to `__version__`.\n   - No user input, network activity, dynamic code execution, or external data handling is present.\n   - The code does not contain any obfuscated segments, suspicious imports, or backdoors.\n   - The purpose is solely to define and expose version information for the package.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code appears correct and standard for version management in Python packages.\n   - No logical errors or anomalies are detected.\n   - The function `get_version()` correctly formats the version tuple, and the version string is assigned to `__version__`.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the code is purely static and harmless.\n   - No suspicious patterns or behaviors are identified.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency and Justification:**\n   - The reports are consistent with each other.\n   - The scores align with the analysis.\n   - The code is standard, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and standard for version management.\n- No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are present.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe and should be considered secure.",
