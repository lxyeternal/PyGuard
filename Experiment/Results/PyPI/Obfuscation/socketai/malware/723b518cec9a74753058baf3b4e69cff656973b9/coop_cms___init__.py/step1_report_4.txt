  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version definition and assignment",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version tuple, formats it into a string via get_version(), and assigns this string to __version__. It also sets a default app config for Django. There are no external inputs, data processing, or suspicious code patterns. The code is simple and standard for versioning in a Python package. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks.",
