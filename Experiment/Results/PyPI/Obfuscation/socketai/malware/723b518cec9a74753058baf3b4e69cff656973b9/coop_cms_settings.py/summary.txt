  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, configuration-driven Django utility module that employs dynamic class loading. No malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation is evident. The primary security concern is the integrity of configuration settings, which could lead to code execution if compromised. The assigned scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and risk approximately 0.3 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
