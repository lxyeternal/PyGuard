  "purpose": "Configuration and utility functions for coop_cms, including class loading, settings retrieval, and URL pattern management.",
  "sources": "Reading from django_settings attributes, import_module calls for dynamic class loading, and potentially dynamic callback and template lists.",
  "sinks": "Potential dynamic import_module usage and getattr calls, which could be manipulated if settings are maliciously altered, but no direct data leaks or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Settings attributes (source) are used to dynamically load classes or functions (sink) via import_module or getattr. Callbacks and class loaders depend on configuration values, which could be influenced by external settings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import_module and getattr based on settings strings without validation could be risky if settings are maliciously altered. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code's primary concern is potential misconfiguration leading to remote code execution via malicious settings.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily relies on dynamic class and function loading through import_module and getattr, based on configuration in django_settings. While this allows flexible customization, it presents a security risk if settings are tampered with, potentially leading to execution of malicious code if external or untrusted inputs are used to set these configurations. No evidence of backdoors, system sabotage, or data exfiltration is apparent. The code does not include network communication, file modifications, or cryptominers. The use of import_module with user-controlled strings is a potential attack vector, but in normal operation, it depends on trusted configuration. The code lacks input validation on settings strings, which could be exploited in a malicious environment. Overall, the code does not contain malware but could be a vector for malicious code execution if settings are compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a configuration utility for the coop_cms project that uses dynamic imports based on settings values. It does not contain malicious behavior by itself but presents a security risk if configuration settings are maliciously manipulated, as it could lead to remote code execution. No malware or backdoors are present; the primary concern is trust in configuration integrity.",
