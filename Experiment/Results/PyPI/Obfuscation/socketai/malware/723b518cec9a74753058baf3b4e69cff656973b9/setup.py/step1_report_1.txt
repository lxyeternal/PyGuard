  "purpose": "Initial setup for packaging a Django-based CMS and a hidden, potentially malicious network communication script.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd(), pwd.getpwuid(), socket.gethostname(), base64.b64encode(), os.getuid()",
  "sinks": "socket.connect(), socket.sendall()",
  "flows": "Data is collected from system and environment, encoded, and then transmitted over a network socket to a decoded IP address.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated network code that attempts to encode system info and send it over a socket without explicit explanation; excessive whitespace and obfuscated string concatenation; the code runs silently with exception handling that suppresses errors; commented-out dependency links suggest potential external code fetching.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with standard package setup code for a Django CMS, which appears legitimate. However, later, there is a concealed network communication segment that collects system information (current working directory, username, hostname), encodes it with XOR, and transmits it over a socket to an IP address that is base64-decoded from a string. The IP address and port are obfuscated via string concatenation and base64 decoding, and the socket connection is made with a short timeout. The try-except block suppresses any errors, and the code runs silently. The presence of this hidden network activity, combined with obfuscation and the silent exception handling, indicates malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or surveillance. The initial setup code is benign and typical of a Python package, but the second segment is suspicious and likely malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs legitimate package setup, but includes a hidden, obfuscated network communication segment that silently transmits system information to an external IP address. This behavior suggests malicious intent related to data exfiltration. The overall risk is high due to the covert data transmission, and the malware score is elevated. The code should be considered malicious and unsafe for use.",
