  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Django-based CMS library and a suspicious hidden network activity script.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, and later reads system environment, current directory, hostname, user info, and attempts network communication.",
  "sinks": "Network socket connection to an obfuscated IP address, sending encoded data; potential exfiltration or remote command channel.",
  "flows": "Metadata reading → environment info collection → encoding and obfuscation → network connection and data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The second part of the code performs obfuscated network communication, sends encoded system info to a hardcoded IP, and uses obfuscation techniques. It is hidden after the setup code with no comments or indication of purpose.",
  "analysis": "Initial code is a standard setup script for a Python package with dependency management. The latter part, hidden at the end, attempts to gather system info (current directory, user name, hostname), encodes it with XOR and base64, and then sends it over a socket connection to a hardcoded, obfuscated IP address. The connection and data transfer are done in a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, indicating an attempt to hide activity. The obfuscation and network activity strongly suggest malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or establishing a backdoor. The code contains no comments explaining this behavior, and the network IP appears hardcoded and encoded, a common tactic for malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code combines legitimate package setup with hidden malicious behavior, specifically exfiltrating system information over a covert network channel. The obfuscated network communication segment is suspicious, hidden at the end of the script with no clear purpose. Overall, this code exhibits malicious intent with a high likelihood of being used for data theft or remote control purposes.",
