  "purpose": "Define custom form classes with Bootstrap styling in a Django project, enhancing form rendering and styling.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__) of Form and ModelForm classes that set up styling and required attributes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used in a potentially harmful way.",
  "flows": "Initialization (__init__) calls _bs_patch_field_class(), which modifies widget attributes for styling and required flags.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Usage of external libraries appears standard for form handling.",
  "analysis": "The code extends Django form classes to automatically add Bootstrap CSS classes to form fields and set the required attribute. It imports a custom utility 'is_checkbox' for conditional styling. The code only modifies widget attributes during form instantiation, with no input/output processing, network activity, or data storage. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for styling Django forms with Bootstrap. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign, functional enhancement for form styling.",
