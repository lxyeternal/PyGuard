  "purpose": "Define custom form classes with Bootstrap styling in a Django application",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'floppyforms' and 'is_checkbox' function from 'coop_cms.templatetags.coop_utils'",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks; the code modifies form widget attributes internally",
  "flows": "Initialization of form objects → patching of widget classes and required attributes during __init__ methods",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual logic observed; code simply enhances form UI",
  "analysis": "The code defines mixins and form classes for styling forms with Bootstrap classes. It imports external libraries and a utility function to check checkbox fields. The _bs_patch_field_class method iterates over form fields to append CSS classes and set required attributes. The constructors invoke this method to modify widget attributes upon form creation. No user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution occurs. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for UI styling enhancement in Django forms and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and standard for form customization.",
