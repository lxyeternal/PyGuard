  "purpose": "Enhance Django form fields with Bootstrap CSS classes and set the 'required' attribute for form validation.",
  "sources": "Form fields during initialization, specifically self.fields and their widget attributes.",
  "sinks": "Modification of widget.attrs for styling and validation; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Iterates over self.fields, checks if a field is a checkbox, appends 'form-control' class, and sets 'required' attribute if needed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and solely for UI styling. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mixins and form classes that modify form field widget attributes during form initialization to add Bootstrap styling and validation attributes. It uses external libraries for styling logic but does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior. The only inconsistency is in one report assigning a risk score of 1, which is unjustified given the benign nature of the code. Therefore, the appropriate final scores are malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0, with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for styling Django forms with Bootstrap. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores should remain at zero for malware and security risk, with high confidence in this assessment.",
