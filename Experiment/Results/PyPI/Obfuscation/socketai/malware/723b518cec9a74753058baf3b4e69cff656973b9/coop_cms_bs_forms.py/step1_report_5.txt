  "purpose": "Define Django form classes with Bootstrap styling enhancements.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__) of Form and ModelForm classes, which may receive data or input arguments.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no output or data leakage points are evident, nor are untrusted data directly sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into form instances, processed during __init__, then styling attributes are patched locally. No external data transfer occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The imported module 'coop_cms.templatetags.coop_utils' and the function 'is_checkbox' are context-dependent, but no malicious behavior is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines form classes that enhance base Django forms with Bootstrap styling by patching CSS classes and required attributes during initialization. It relies on external utility functions, but these are used only for styling logic, not for malicious activities. There are no network calls, file operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears straightforward and safe, focused on UI enhancement without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of form styling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates within expected patterns for Django form customization.",
