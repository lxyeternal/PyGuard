{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom form classes that extend Django forms to add Bootstrap styling and required attributes.",
  "sources": "Imports 'floppyforms' and 'is_checkbox' function from 'coop_cms.templatetags.coop_utils'. Uses 'self.fields' from Django form classes during initialization.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "The form initialization flows from the constructor (__init__) to '_bs_patch_field_class', which modifies widget attributes in 'self.fields'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code are present. The code is standard for form customization and styling.",
  "analysis": "The code creates mixins and subclasses to add CSS classes and 'required' attributes to form fields. It relies on external imports for form handling and checkbox detection, but does not process or execute external data inputs or untrusted sources. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation for enhancing form styling and validation in Django. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. The code appears safe and intended for UI presentation purposes.",
