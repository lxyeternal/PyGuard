  "purpose": "Enhance form fields with Bootstrap CSS classes and required attributes for styling and validation in Django forms.",
  "sources": "Import of floppyforms library, use of is_checkbox function from coop_cms.templatetags.coop_utils, and class constructors (__init__).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; form field attributes are modified locally for styling and validation purposes.",
  "flows": "Constructor calls super().__init__(), then _bs_patch_field_class() modifies field widget attributes based on form data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious operations. Usage of external functions like is_checkbox is context-dependent but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mixin and form classes to add Bootstrap styling and required attributes to Django form fields. It imports external libraries and functions but does not process or handle external input/output directly. The modifications are purely related to UI styling and validation attributes, with no evident data leaks, code injections, or malicious behavior. The code structure is straightforward, and the logic is typical for Django form customization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for styling Django forms with Bootstrap, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely modifies form field attributes for presentation purposes.",
