  "purpose": "Middleware to handle permission exceptions and redirect unauthorized users to login page.",
  "sources": "request object (request), get_login_url() function, exception object",
  "sinks": "redirect_to_login() function (redirects user), potential user redirection upon permission denial",
  "flows": "Exception occurs -> process_exception checks for PermissionDenied -> if user is not authenticated -> attempts to get login URL -> redirects user to login page",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Use of get_login_url() is standard; fallback to None on exception is safe here.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django middleware handling PermissionDenied exceptions by redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page. It imports necessary functions from Django and a utility to get login URL. It attempts to handle NoReverseMatch exception gracefully. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious logic is present. No data leakage or insecure data handling identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard middleware for permission handling in Django, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected permission exception management.",
