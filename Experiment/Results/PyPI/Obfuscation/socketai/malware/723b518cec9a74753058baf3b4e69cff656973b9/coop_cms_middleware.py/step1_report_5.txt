  "sinks": "redirect_to_login function that redirects users to login URL.",
  "flows": "Exception occurs -> process_exception checks if it's PermissionDenied -> if user is unauthenticated -> attempts to get login URL -> redirects user to login page.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic present. The code uses standard Django middleware practices.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a Django middleware class to handle PermissionDenied exceptions. When such an exception occurs, it checks if the user is unauthenticated and redirects them to a login page. It retrieves the login URL via get_login_url(), with fallback if URL resolution fails. The logic appears standard and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious network activity. Use of standard Django functions suggests normal operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward middleware component handling permission exceptions by redirecting users. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain compromise, or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
