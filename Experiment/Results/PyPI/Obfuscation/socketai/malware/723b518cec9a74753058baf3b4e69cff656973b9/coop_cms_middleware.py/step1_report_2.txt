  "purpose": "Middleware to handle permission exceptions and redirect unauthenticated users to login",
  "sources": "request.user.is_authenticated(), get_login_url(), exception instance (PermissionDenied)",
  "sinks": "redirect_to_login function, potential redirect URL (login_url)",
  "flows": "PermissionDenied exception -> process_exception -> check if user is authenticated -> get_login_url() -> redirect_to_login(request.path, login_url)",
  "anomalies": "None observed; standard Django permission handling logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines a middleware class that intercepts PermissionDenied exceptions during request processing. If the user is not authenticated, it attempts to retrieve a login URL and redirects the user to login page. Usage of standard Django functions and exception handling appears normal. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. No data leakage, system manipulation, or malicious network activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard permission exception handling middleware without any malicious intent or security risks. It correctly redirects unauthenticated users to the login page, aligning with common Django practices.",
