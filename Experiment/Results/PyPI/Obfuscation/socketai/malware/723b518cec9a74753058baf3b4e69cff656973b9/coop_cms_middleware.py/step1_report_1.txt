  "purpose": "Middleware to handle permission exceptions and redirect unauthenticated users to login",
  "sources": "PermissionDenied exception, request.user.is_authenticated(), get_login_url()",
  "sinks": "redirect_to_login() function, which redirects the user to a login URL",
  "flows": "PermissionDenied exception occurs -> process_exception method invoked -> checks user authentication -> attempts to get login URL -> redirects unauthenticated users to login page",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code detected. The code uses standard Django functions and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a Django middleware class that intercepts permission exceptions. If an unauthenticated user encounters a permission denial, it redirects them to a login page. The method get_login_url() is called, which might raise NoReverseMatch exception, handled gracefully. The overall structure is straightforward and follows common Django patterns. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django permission middleware with proper exception handling. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
