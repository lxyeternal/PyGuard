      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious intent through obfuscated, covert PowerShell command execution triggered during setup. The behavior aligns with common malware tactics such as evasion and hidden payload execution. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified, indicating a serious security concern requiring prompt review."
