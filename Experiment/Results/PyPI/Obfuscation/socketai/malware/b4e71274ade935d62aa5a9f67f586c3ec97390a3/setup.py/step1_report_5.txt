  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, defining dependencies and package info.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function call, the 'install_requires' list, and the version string variable.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data handling or sensitive data output.",
  "flows": "N/A, straightforward package setup without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'prpblpn7oibi9yy7' appears obfuscated or intentionally non-descriptive; version stored in a variable with a seemingly random name.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools to configure a Python package. It assigns a version string to a variable with a non-descriptive name, which could be an obfuscation attempt. The setup() function specifies the package name as 'prpblpn7oibi9yy7' and includes a list of dependencies: 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', 'requests'. The dependencies themselves are common libraries, but their inclusion together suggests possible automation or malicious coordination. The code lacks any network activity, input handling, or data processing, and no malicious code or backdoors are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated naming and dependencies that could be associated with automation or potentially malicious intent. However, based solely on this fragment, no malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident.",
