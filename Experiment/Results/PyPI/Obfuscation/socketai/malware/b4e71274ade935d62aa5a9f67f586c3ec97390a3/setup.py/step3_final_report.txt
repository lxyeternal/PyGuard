  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with obfuscated identifiers and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; only defines package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only executes setup.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and package names; no dynamic code or network activity; dependencies are common but could be misused elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script importing 'setuptools', defining a version string in an obfuscated variable, and calling 'setup()' with a package name and dependencies. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. Obfuscation is present but does not imply malicious intent. The dependencies are common packages; their misuse depends on broader context. The code does not perform any network, file, or environment operations. The malware score is appropriately zero; obfuscation is high but not necessarily malicious; security risk is low. The scores across reports are consistent with these observations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated identifiers, likely to conceal purpose but without malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants attention but does not justify a malware classification. The overall security posture is low risk. No changes to scores are necessary.",
