  "purpose": "Define a class named 'rYCzzUiBzTxbtxszrxrKbHfCPbPmuSCi' that prints 'Hi' when the class is defined.",
  "sources": "Class declaration and the print statement within the class body",
  "sinks": "Print statement output",
  "flows": "Class declaration triggers the print statement immediately upon code execution",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name with no functional purpose; code executes a print statement at class definition time, which is atypical and could be used to obfuscate or trigger actions during import",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a seemingly random name. Upon import or execution, the class body executes immediately due to the print statement, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. There are no inputs, no external data sources, and no malicious code or suspicious behavior detected. The class name appears obfuscated, but no malicious intent is evident. The print statement is benign and does not harm or leak data.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains an obfuscated class name and executes a print statement at import time, which could be used to obfuscate behavior or cause side effects during module import. However, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
