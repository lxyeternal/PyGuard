{
  "purpose": "Defines a class with a complex name that executes a print statement during class definition.",
  "sources": "Class definition statement; the print(\"Hi\") executes immediately during class creation.",
  "sinks": "stdout via print; no data flows or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "Class definition (source) directly leads to print execution (sink) at import time.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual placement of print inside class body causes code to run during class definition, not instantiation; class name appears obfuscated or random.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a non-descriptive, complex name, executing a print statement immediately during class definition. No functions, methods, or external inputs are present. The pattern of executing code at class load time is unconventional but not malicious. The class name's complexity suggests obfuscation but does not imply malicious intent. No data leaks, network activity, or harmful behavior are detected. The print statement's execution during import could be used for side effects but is benign here. The overall structure is simple, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity or security threats. The primary concern is the unconventional pattern of code execution at class definition time and the obfuscated class name, which may be used for obfuscation but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score remains 0, and the security risk is minimal. The obfuscation score is moderately high due to the class name complexity. Overall, the code poses no security threat but exhibits slight obfuscation and unconventional pattern.",
