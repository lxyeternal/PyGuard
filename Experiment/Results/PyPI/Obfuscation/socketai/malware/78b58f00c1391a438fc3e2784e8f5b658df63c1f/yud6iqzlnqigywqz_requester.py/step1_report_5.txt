  "purpose": "Defines a class with an obfuscated name and prints 'Hi' upon class definition",
  "sources": "Class definition statement",
  "sinks": "print statement (outputs to console)",
  "flows": "Class declaration -> print statement",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name (obfuscated), no clear purpose, no methods or attributes, class executes print upon definition rather than instantiation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a complex, obfuscated name that does nothing except print 'Hi' when the class is parsed by the interpreter. This is unusual because class definitions typically contain methods or attributes, not immediate execution code. The print statement executes at the time of class creation, which is unconventional. There are no external data sources, no untrusted inputs, no malicious code, or suspicious behaviors like network access, data theft, or backdoors. The obfuscated class name might suggest an attempt to conceal intent, but without further context, it appears benign and possibly designed for obfuscation or testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, with an obfuscated class name and an immediate print statement. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, no malware or security risks are evident, and it appears to serve no functional purpose beyond outputting 'Hi'. The obfuscation may be intentional to hide intent, but based solely on this snippet, it is benign.",
