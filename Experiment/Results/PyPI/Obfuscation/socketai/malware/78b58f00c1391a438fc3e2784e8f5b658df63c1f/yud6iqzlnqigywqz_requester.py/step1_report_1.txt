  "purpose": "Defines a class with a print statement that outputs a greeting message.",
  "sources": "The class definition and the print statement within it.",
  "sinks": "The print function outputs to stdout; no untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the print statement executes upon class definition.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears as a nonsensical string; no parameters or dynamic code. No hidden or obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a seemingly random name and prints 'Hi' when interpreted. The print statement executes immediately during class definition, which is unusual but not malicious. There are no inputs, no external data handling, and no malicious actions or hidden code. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple class definition with an immediate print statement. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, contains no security risks, and appears to be benign. The unusual class name does not impact security but may suggest obfuscation or placeholder content. Overall, no malicious or suspicious activity is present.",
