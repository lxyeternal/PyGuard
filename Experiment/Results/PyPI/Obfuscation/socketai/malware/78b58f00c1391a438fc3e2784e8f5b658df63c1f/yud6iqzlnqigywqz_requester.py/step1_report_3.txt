  "purpose": "Define a class with a print statement that outputs 'Hi'",
  "sources": "The class definition, specifically the print statement inside the class body",
  "sinks": "The print statement which outputs to standard output",
  "flows": "The class is defined, and the print statement executes at class creation time, outputting 'Hi'",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an unusual pattern of executing a print statement directly within a class body, which is not typical; however, it does not perform any malicious actions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a nonsensical name. The print statement inside the class body executes immediately when the class is parsed, outputting 'Hi' to standard output. There are no inputs, no data flows to external systems, and no suspicious or malicious operations. The pattern is unusual but benign. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple class definition with an immediate print statement. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable aspect is the unconventional placement of the print statement inside the class body, which does not pose security concerns.",
