{
  "purpose": "Defines a class with a name that appears to be randomly generated, with an immediate print statement.",
  "sources": "The print statement which outputs 'Hi' when the class is interpreted.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs data to standard output, which is generally benign.",
  "flows": "Class definition flows directly into a print statement during module loading.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears to be a random string, which could be a sign of obfuscation or generated code. No other suspicious behavior or code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an obscure name and executes a print statement at the class level. There are no functions, methods, external data reads, or suspicious operations. The class name itself looks like random or obfuscated text, which could indicate an attempt to hide intent, but the content itself is harmless. No malware behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple class definition with an immediate print statement and no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code appears benign, though the random class name could suggest obfuscation or nonsensical code. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
