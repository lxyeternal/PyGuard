{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, including reading a README file, defining package metadata, and calling setup().",
  "sources": "Reading README.md from the filesystem, executing base64-decoded code, and package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially malicious base64-decoded code execution; reading files; package setup functions.",
  "flows": "Base64-encoded string is decoded and executed, which could lead to arbitrary code execution upon running this script. Package metadata is read from files and variables.",
  "anomalies": "The use of exec() on base64-decoded content is suspicious; the base64 string encodes a large block of code that, upon decoding, performs various network and system operations, potentially malicious. The code also contains obfuscated variable names and redundant import statements.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and reads a README file. The critical concern is the exec() call with decoded base64 string, which executes code that appears to perform network operations, shell commands, and potentially malicious activities. The decoded code includes network requests to URLs, runs commands, and loads scripts, indicating malicious intent or backdoor functionality. The rest of the script appears to set up a Python package with benign-looking metadata, but the presence of the exec() with encoded payload is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated malicious payload executed via exec() of base64-encoded data, indicating probable malicious behavior. The package setup code appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the malicious code execution. Overall, this code should be considered highly dangerous and not safe to use.",
