{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python package setup script with embedded obfuscated code that decodes and executes additional code.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded and executed at the beginning; reading README.md file; environment variables (indirectly via setup); package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decoded code; potentially dangerous if the decoded code is malicious; reading README.md file (safe); package setup parameters (safe).",
  "flows": "The decoded base64 content (source) is executed (sink), which may lead to malicious actions depending on its content. Other flows are standard setup parameter assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on dynamically decoded base64 content; heavily obfuscated code; base64 string decoding and execution at startup; inconsistent variable naming and encoding; the decoded code likely contains further code that can perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, then reads and encodes a long base64 string which it decodes and executes via exec(). The decoded code is a large, obfuscated script that appears to import modules, create objects, and perform network requests or system modifications. It appears to be designed to run potentially malicious code, possibly downloading or executing further payloads. The package setup code is standard, but the presence of exec with decoded content is suspicious. The obfuscation and dynamic execution are common tactics for malware delivery. Overall, the script is suspicious and potentially malicious, designed to execute hidden code at runtime.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious base64-encoded payload executed via exec(), indicating malicious intent. The rest of the code is standard package setup, but the obfuscated payload poses a significant security risk. Confidence in detection is high due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution.",
