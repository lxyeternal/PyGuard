{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with metadata and dependencies, likely intended for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the file 'README.md' for the long description; it also decodes a base64-encoded string which executes potentially malicious code.",
  "sinks": "The decoded base64 string executes code that imports modules, runs subprocesses, and potentially performs network requests or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The base64-decoded code executes immediately upon import, creating flows from the source to the sink (exec), which runs arbitrary code, possibly involving subprocesses and network requests.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded payload executed via exec() at the start, which is a common obfuscation technique. The decoded code appears complex, involving subprocess calls, dynamic imports, and network requests to external URLs. These are suspicious behaviors indicative of malicious intent or backdoor activities.",
  "analysis": "The initial import includes a base64 string that, when decoded and executed, performs multiple actions: it imports various modules, runs subprocess commands, makes network requests to specific URLs, and dynamically imports modules with complex string manipulations. This pattern strongly suggests obfuscated malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, remote control, or backdoors. The rest of the script is a typical setup script, but the embedded obfuscated code poses significant security concerns. The presence of dynamic code execution and network activity with no clear benign purpose indicates high malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated, potentially malicious code executed at import time, likely establishing a backdoor or exfiltrating data. The setup code appears legitimate, but the embedded payload is suspicious and potentially harmful. Overall, this code should be treated with high suspicion and not trusted for use.",
