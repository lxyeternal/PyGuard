{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'cosmosTroposphere' with additional malicious intent evident from network activity and suspicious URLs.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description; reading environment variables; executing 'os.system' command to run a curl request.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' call executing a curl command to an external URL (http://canarytokens.com/...).",
  "flows": "Reading package metadata from README.md -> executing system command to contact external malicious server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or nonsensical variable names; the URL 'https://evil.com' in package metadata; executing an external curl command to a suspicious domain; use of potentially malicious URL 'canarytokens.com'; presence of suspicious URL in package description and author email; no apparent legitimate reason for these network activities in a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and os, reads a README file for long_description, and sets up package metadata with suspicious URLs ('https://evil.com') and strange variable names. The critical anomaly is the 'os.system' call that executes a curl command to an external URL, which is highly suspicious and likely malicious. This command may attempt to exfiltrate data or contact a malicious server. The package metadata itself contains malicious URLs, indicating possible malicious intent. Overall, the code appears designed to perform malicious network activity during setup, potentially to exfiltrate data or contact a malicious server.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior with external network contact via 'curl' during package setup, suspicious URLs, and obfuscated variable names. It indicates high malicious intent and security risk.",
