      "conclusion": "The code contains malicious indicators, notably executing a network request to canarytokens.com during setup and embedding suspicious URLs. The behavior suggests potential data exfiltration or malicious signaling. The malware and security risk scores should be high, around 0.85-1, with obfuscation minimal. Overall, this package is highly suspicious and potentially malicious."
