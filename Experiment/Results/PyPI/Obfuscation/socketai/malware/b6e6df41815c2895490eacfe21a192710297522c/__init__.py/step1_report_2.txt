{
  "purpose": "The function prints the message 'installed' when called.",
  "sources": "The function is called directly after its definition, no external data inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "The code only performs a print operation, which is not a sink for untrusted data or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from any source to a sink; the code simply executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears to be obfuscated or randomly generated; no external or sensitive data is used or manipulated.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with a seemingly random name that prints a static message. The function is immediately invoked after definition. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no external calls. The code structure is minimal, with no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The function name might be obfuscated, but that alone is not malicious. Overall, the code is benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign function that prints a message. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in this snippet.",
