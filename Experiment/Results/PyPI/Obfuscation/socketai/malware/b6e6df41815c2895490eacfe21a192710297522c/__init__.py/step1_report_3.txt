{
  "purpose": "A simple function that prints 'installed' and is immediately called, likely for indicating installation or setup completion.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external files, network, or other data sinks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated, which could be suspicious. The code is minimal but uses an obfuscated function name; no other suspicious behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that only prints a message. The function is called immediately after definition. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no network activity, no credential use, or other typical malicious behaviors. The obfuscation of the function name could be an attempt to hide purpose, but given the simplicity, it appears benign. No signs of malware or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a simple print statement with an obfuscated function name. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected. The obfuscation is minimal and likely harmless.",
