  "purpose": "Defines and calls a function that prints 'installed'",
  "sources": "The function call SvkYLbVwjZVxWZNEJIKjZhfLaNfUMXLy()",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output; no untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Function is called immediately after definition; no data flow beyond printing",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated; no parameters, no complex logic; no external data or input; no signs of malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with an obfuscated name that prints a static string 'installed'. The function is invoked immediately after its definition. There are no inputs, external data reads, or network operations. The obfuscated name could suggest an attempt to hide functionality, but the code itself is benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and benign, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The obfuscated function name appears to be for obscurity rather than malicious purpose.",
