{
  "purpose": "Defines and calls a simple function that prints 'installed'.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated, but the code performs a benign print operation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with an obfuscated name that outputs a static string. The function is immediately invoked, resulting in a console print. There are no inputs, data processing, network calls, or other potentially malicious actions. The naming might be intended to evade simple detection, but the behavior itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and performs a harmless print statement. Despite obfuscated naming, there is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior in this snippet.",
