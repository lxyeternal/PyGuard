{
  "purpose": "A simple function that prints 'installed' and is immediately invoked.",
  "sources": "The function name is obfuscated; no external inputs or data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a static string to the console; no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Function call flows directly from definition to execution, with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; no malicious code, data leaks, or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that prints a static message and calls it immediately. No external data, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, serving only to hide the function name, but does not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward and benign, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, trivial, and does not exhibit malicious behavior. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score should be 0. The obfuscation score can be set to 0.2 to reflect the obfuscated name, and the security risk score to 0.0.",
