{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to execute malicious actions during package installation, including contacting external servers, downloading, and executing a binary payload, with obfuscated code to hide intent.",
  "sources": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; makes HTTP GET requests to suspicious URLs; downloads an executable file; executes the downloaded file via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded binary via os.system; network requests to external malicious domains; writing files to disk.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' → HTTP request to 'linkedopports.com' → download of 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe' from 'python-release.com' → execution of the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; silent exception handling; downloading and executing external payload during setup; network activity to suspicious domains.",
  "analysis": "The code performs network requests to suspicious URLs, downloads an executable, and runs it silently during setup, indicating malicious intent. Obfuscation and error suppression further conceal malicious activity. The behavior aligns with typical supply chain malware, posing a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, actively downloading and executing external payloads during installation, with obfuscation and silent error handling to hide its intent. The scores assigned (malware: 1.0, obfuscated: 0.9, securityRisk: 1.0) are justified and reflect the severity of the threat.",
