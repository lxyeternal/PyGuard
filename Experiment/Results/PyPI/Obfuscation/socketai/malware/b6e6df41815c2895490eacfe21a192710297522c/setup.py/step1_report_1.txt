{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package with additional functionality that executes malicious actions during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables ('COMPUTERNAME') and makes HTTP requests to external URLs. It also downloads and executes a file from a suspicious URL during the install process.",
  "sinks": "Executing a downloaded file ('start ' + filename), which could run arbitrary code. Requests to external URLs could be used for data exfiltration or command and control.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> HTTP request to external server -> Downloads a file from a suspicious URL -> Executes the downloaded file during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code retrieves system environment info, contacts external servers, downloads, and executes a file during package installation, all within the setup script. The URLs used are suspicious and could be malicious. The code also suppresses exceptions, hiding potential errors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries 'setuptools' and 'os' along with 'requests' and custom 'install' class. It defines a function 'wKwxfPsyOBsxTWVfELNNzcLIFnVYBkGl' that reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then makes requests to specific URLs. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it. This behavior is highly indicative of malicious activity during package installation, including downloading and executing potentially harmful code. The code is obfuscated through random function and variable names, and it suppresses exceptions, which further suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by retrieving system info, contacting external servers, downloading, and executing an executable during package setup. The obfuscated names and exception suppression indicate intent to hide malicious actions. This package should be considered malicious and unsafe to use.",
