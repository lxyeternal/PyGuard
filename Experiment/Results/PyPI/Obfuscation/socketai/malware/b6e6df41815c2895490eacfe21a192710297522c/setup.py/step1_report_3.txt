{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, performs malicious network communication and potentially downloads and executes a file from a remote server.",
  "sources": "os.environ['COMPUTERNAME'], requests.get() calls to external URLs, reading environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Writing to a file and executing it with os.system('start ...'), network requests, and potentially executing downloaded content.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is used to generate a URL request, which then triggers a second request to download an executable file, and if on Windows, runs the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names and class names, use of broad try-except without error handling, downloading and executing external code during setup, no explicit user consent, and active network activity in a package install script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and requests, and defines a function wKwxfPsyOBsxTWVfELNNzcLIFnVYBkGl() that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable. It sends a GET request to a suspicious URL with this variable, then, if on Windows, downloads an executable from a remote URL and executes it. The custom install class calls this function during installation. The code’s obfuscation and active remote code execution during package installation indicate malicious intent, potentially serving as a backdoor or malware delivery mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior, including downloading and executing remote code during installation, which is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious. The code’s obfuscation, network activity, and execution of downloaded files during setup strongly indicate malicious intent.",
