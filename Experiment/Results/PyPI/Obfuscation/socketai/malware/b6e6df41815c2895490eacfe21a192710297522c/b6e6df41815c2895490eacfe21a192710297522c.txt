      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, actively downloading and executing external payloads during installation, with obfuscation and silent error handling to hide its intent. The scores assigned (malware: 1.0, obfuscated: 0.9, securityRisk: 1.0) are justified and reflect the severity of the threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, trivial, and does not exhibit malicious behavior. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score should be 0. The obfuscation score can be set to 0.2 to reflect the obfuscated name, and the security risk score to 0.0."
