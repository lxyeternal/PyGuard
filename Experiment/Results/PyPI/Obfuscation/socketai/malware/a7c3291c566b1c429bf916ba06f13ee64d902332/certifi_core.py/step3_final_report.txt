{
  "purpose": "Locate and read the 'cacert.pem' certificate bundle from the 'certifi' package or local directory, supporting multiple Python versions.",
  "sources": "Resource access functions that retrieve 'cacert.pem' path or content using version-specific import and resource handling methods.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations that load 'cacert.pem' content; no external data or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Resource location functions provide path or content to callers, with no external untrusted data flow or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; complex version-dependent resource access logic; no signs of malicious code or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code's core purpose is benign resource management for SSL certificate verification. Obfuscation appears superficial, aimed at hiding complexity rather than malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are detected. The resource access methods are standard, and the obfuscation does not introduce vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.6) are consistent with the benign, obfuscated nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a resource locator for a trusted CA bundle, with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. The security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The current assessments and scores are appropriate.",
