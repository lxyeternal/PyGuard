  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with superficial obfuscation and no active malicious behavior. The main concerns are obfuscation and the use of os.system for package upload, which could be exploited if altered. Malware score is 0, risk is moderate (~0.3), obfuscation is notable (~0.6). Overall, supply chain risk is low but should be monitored, especially if code is modified."
