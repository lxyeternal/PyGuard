  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'certifi' package, extracting version info and optionally publishing the package.",
  "sources": "Reads 'certifi/__init__.py' for version; uses sys.argv for command-line args; executes 'python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload' via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing package upload, which can be exploited if modified.",
  "flows": "Reads version from init.py -> Checks sys.argv for 'publish' -> Executes upload command via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; presence of syntax errors in some reports; use of deprecated 'upload' command; potential obfuscation or tampering.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. It reads version info, handles 'publish' command, and uploads package via os.system. Obfuscated variable names are suspicious but not malicious. Syntax errors in some reports suggest possible tampering. No evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration. The use of os.system for uploading is risky but common in legacy setup scripts. Overall, the script appears benign but warrants caution due to obfuscation and command execution practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with superficial obfuscation and no active malicious behavior. The main concerns are obfuscation and the use of os.system for package upload, which could be exploited if altered. Malware score is 0, risk is moderate (~0.3), obfuscation is notable (~0.6). Overall, supply chain risk is low but should be monitored, especially if code is modified.",
