      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with superficial obfuscation and no active malicious behavior. The main concerns are obfuscation and the use of os.system for package upload, which could be exploited if altered. Malware score is 0, risk is moderate (~0.3), obfuscation is notable (~0.6). Overall, supply chain risk is low but should be monitored, especially if code is modified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a resource locator for a trusted CA bundle, with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. The security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The current assessments and scores are appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with suspicious import identifiers and undefined function calls, suggesting potential concealment of malicious behavior. While no explicit malicious activity is shown, the obfuscation raises suspicion. The overall security risk is moderate, and further investigation is recommended to determine the nature of the imported entities and functions."
