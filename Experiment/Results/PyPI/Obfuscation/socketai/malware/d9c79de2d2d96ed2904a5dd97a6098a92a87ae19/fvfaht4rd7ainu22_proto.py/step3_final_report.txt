{
  "purpose": "Implements SOCKS proxy client functionalities supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with network connection, DNS resolution, and optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Network socket reads, address resolution functions, input parameters for connection and authentication.",
  "sinks": "Socket send/recv operations, network connections, data flows through socket communication.",
  "flows": "Source data (input, DNS resolution) flows through socket send/recv functions, connection setup, and protocol handling functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, complex control flow, but no hardcoded secrets or payloads; standard network handling logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with functions for connection, authentication, DNS resolution, and data transmission. Obfuscation is evident in variable and class names, which could be for concealment. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. The network operations are typical for proxy clients, and no signs of malicious behavior such as system sabotage or data theft are present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious intent based on static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with high obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage. The obfuscation and complexity could be used to hide malicious activity, but static analysis alone does not confirm this. Overall, the code is low risk but warrants cautious deployment and further behavioral testing.",
