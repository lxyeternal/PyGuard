  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with high obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage. The obfuscation and complexity could be used to hide malicious activity, but static analysis alone does not confirm this. Overall, the code is low risk but warrants cautious deployment and further behavioral testing."
