  "purpose": "Defines custom DNS resolver and proxy connector classes for flexible network configuration, including proxy support and DNS resolution.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for proxy credentials, DNS resolution, and network configuration functions.",
  "sinks": "URL formation, network request initiation, proxy setup, and DNS resolution calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into URL construction and network request functions, passing through proxy configuration and DNS resolution methods.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, dynamic URL construction, no hardcoded secrets or malicious commands, standard proxy configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom network resolver and proxy connector classes with obfuscated identifiers, primarily for flexible network setup. No evidence of malicious commands, backdoors, or data exfiltration. Obfuscation is present but appears to serve to hide implementation details rather than malicious intent. The code manages proxy settings and DNS resolution securely, with parameters passed dynamically. No suspicious network activity or malicious payloads are detected. The obfuscation level is notable but not sufficient to suggest malicious behavior; it warrants cautious review but not outright suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, serving as an advanced network configuration utility with obfuscation that does not indicate malicious intent. No active malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The overall malware score is 0, with a moderate obfuscation score of 0.6 and a low security risk score of 0.2, reflecting cautious observation due to obfuscation but no malicious activity.",
