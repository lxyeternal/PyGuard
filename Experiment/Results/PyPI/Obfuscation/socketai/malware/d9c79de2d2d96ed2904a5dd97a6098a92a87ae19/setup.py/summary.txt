  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits multiple signs of malicious activity, including heavy obfuscation, embedded encoded payloads, dynamic execution, silent dependency installation, and environment manipulation. These behaviors are consistent with malware/backdoor functionalities. The high suspicion, combined with the decoding and execution routines, indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0.9, obfuscated: 0.9, security risk: 0.9) are justified and aligned with the observed behaviors."
