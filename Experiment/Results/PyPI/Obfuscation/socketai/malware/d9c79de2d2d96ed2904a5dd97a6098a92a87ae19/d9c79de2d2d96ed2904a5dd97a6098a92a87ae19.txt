      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits multiple signs of malicious activity, including heavy obfuscation, embedded encoded payloads, dynamic execution, silent dependency installation, and environment manipulation. These behaviors are consistent with malware/backdoor functionalities. The high suspicion, combined with the decoding and execution routines, indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0.9, obfuscated: 0.9, security risk: 0.9) are justified and aligned with the observed behaviors."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a network utility with significant obfuscation, lacking explicit malicious payloads. While it could be exploited for malicious purposes if fed malicious inputs, there is no direct evidence of malware. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood is low but non-negligible due to obfuscation and potential misuse."

      "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, serving as an advanced network configuration utility with obfuscation that does not indicate malicious intent. No active malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The overall malware score is 0, with a moderate obfuscation score of 0.6 and a low security risk score of 0.2, reflecting cautious observation due to obfuscation but no malicious activity."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with high obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage. The obfuscation and complexity could be used to hide malicious activity, but static analysis alone does not confirm this. Overall, the code is low risk but warrants cautious deployment and further behavioral testing."

The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code snippet. No modifications are necessary."
