  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python package code for malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules with obfuscated names, version string, and __all__ declaration.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows include import statements and __all__ exports; no direct untrusted data input or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated imports and exported classes/functions suggest internal module interactions; no external data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated import names, minimal code structure, and version string; no explicit malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module with obfuscated identifiers and version info, likely part of a proxy or network library. The reports indicate 'Empty response' with no detailed logs or code snippets, making it impossible to identify vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The obfuscation appears to be a naming choice rather than an indicator of malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, payloads, or backdoors are evident. Given the lack of concrete evidence, the code and reports do not suggest malicious behavior or significant security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with obfuscation not necessarily indicating malicious intent. The reports lack detailed data, so risk and malware scores should be minimal. No vulnerabilities or malicious activities are detected based on current information.",
