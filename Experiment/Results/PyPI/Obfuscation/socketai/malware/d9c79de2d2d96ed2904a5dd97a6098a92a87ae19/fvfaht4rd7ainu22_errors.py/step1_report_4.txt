{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, likely for use in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions without external input or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows detected; classes are only defined with inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated, consisting of random character strings, which is suspicious and may be intended to hide malicious intent or obfuscate functionality. No actual implementation or logic is provided.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains class declarations with obfuscated names, inheriting from built-in exceptions or OS error classes. There are no methods, no data handling, and no code execution. The obfuscated naming pattern is unusual and could be intended to conceal malicious behavior, but on its own, the code does not exhibit malicious actions or security risks. Lack of executable logic limits the assessment, but the obfuscation is a concern.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists solely of obfuscated class declarations inheriting from standard exceptions, which could be used to hide malicious payloads or backdoors if integrated into larger code. However, based solely on this snippet, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation and minimal structure warrant caution.",
