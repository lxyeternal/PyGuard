{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple custom exception classes, some inheriting from a base exception class and others from OSError.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance statements; no input reading, no data sources.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data processing or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure, non-descriptive class names, which can be a technique to obfuscate intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code only creates several custom exception classes with randomized, non-meaningful names, potentially to obfuscate purpose. There is no code logic, data processing, or external interaction. The lack of functional code or data handling makes malicious behavior unlikely. However, the obfuscation could be a tactic to hide malicious intent, but nothing suspicious is explicitly present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be solely defining obfuscated custom exceptions, possibly for use in a larger codebase. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks within this fragment.",
