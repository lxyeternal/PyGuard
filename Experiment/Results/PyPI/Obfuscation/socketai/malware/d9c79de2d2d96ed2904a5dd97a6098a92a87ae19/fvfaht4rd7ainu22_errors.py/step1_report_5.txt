{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, some inheriting from standard exception classes, with no functional implementation or behavior beyond class definitions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions are static and do not read input or data. No runtime data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks, such as data output, external calls, or system modifications, are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths exist, as the code only defines classes without any execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The class names appear obfuscated, consisting of random strings, which is unusual and could be a sign of hiding intent. However, the code contains no other suspicious behavior, such as code execution, network activity, or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with obfuscated class names. No methods, data processing, or external interactions are present. The naming pattern suggests possible obfuscation, but without additional code, this appears as a structural choice rather than malicious activity. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful system commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is limited to defining obfuscated custom exception classes with no operational logic or external interactions. While the obfuscated names are suspicious, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
