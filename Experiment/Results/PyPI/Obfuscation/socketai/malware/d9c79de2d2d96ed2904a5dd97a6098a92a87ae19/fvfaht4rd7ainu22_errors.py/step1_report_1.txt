{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, possibly for use in larger codebase or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions, no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or sensitive information output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class definitions do not process data.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are nonsensical and obfuscated; no meaningful functionality; inheritance from exception classes with no additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions that inherit from standard exception classes or custom exceptions, with random, obfuscated class names. There are no functions, data processing, network activities, or other behaviors. The pattern suggests potential obfuscation, but no malicious activity is evident. The classes do not perform any actions or contain executable code; thus, no malicious intent or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be intentionally obfuscated class declarations for exceptions with no functionality. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
