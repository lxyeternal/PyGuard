{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, likely intended for use within a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions are static; no input reading or external data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares classes without logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The class names appear to be random, obfuscated, or auto-generated, which could suggest obfuscation but might also be harmless if used intentionally. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations, all inheriting from standard exceptions or OS errors. There are no functions, data handling, network operations, or code execution. The obfuscated class names may indicate an attempt to hide intent, but without executable code, no malicious activity can be determined. The lack of data processing, input/output, or network activity suggests benign usage, albeit with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a set of custom exception class declarations with obfuscated class names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code itself is safe but may be part of a larger, possibly obfuscated, codebase.",
