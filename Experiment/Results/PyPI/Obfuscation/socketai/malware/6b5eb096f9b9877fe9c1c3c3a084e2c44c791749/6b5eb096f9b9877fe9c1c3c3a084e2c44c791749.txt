      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command execution during package setup. The behavior aligns with known tactics in malware and supply chain attacks. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified. Further decoding of the PowerShell command would be necessary for definitive confirmation, but current evidence warrants high alert."
