  "conclusion": "The dependency is largely benign with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is subprocess execution without input validation, which warrants a moderate risk score of 0.6. All other indicators are safe, and the overall assessment suggests cautious monitoring rather than outright rejection."
