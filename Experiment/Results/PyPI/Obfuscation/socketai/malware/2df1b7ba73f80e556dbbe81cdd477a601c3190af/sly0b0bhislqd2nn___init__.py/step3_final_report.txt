  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security posture of the open source Python dependency based on multiple reports, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Subprocess calls, environment variable access, data handling routines, command executions, and file reads.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution points, environment variable usage, command line interfaces, data outputs, and potential network communications.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or untrusted data flow into subprocess commands or data processing functions, potentially leading to command injection or data leakage.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess without input validation, potential command execution based on environment variables, no explicit malicious payloads or obfuscation detected, but subprocess calls pose moderate risk.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment variable access, subprocess calls, and data handling with no signs of malicious payloads or obfuscation. The main concern is subprocess calls executed without input validation, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted. Other reports confirm benign behavior with no suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious activities. Scores across reports are consistent: malware=0, obfuscated=0. Risk scores vary from 0.1 to 0.45, with the highest in report 1 due to subprocess concerns. Considering the potential for command injection, I recommend increasing the overall security risk score to 0.6 to reflect the real danger of unvalidated subprocess execution, while maintaining malware and obfuscation scores at 0.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is largely benign with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is subprocess execution without input validation, which warrants a moderate risk score of 0.6. All other indicators are safe, and the overall assessment suggests cautious monitoring rather than outright rejection.",
