{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom install command which collects system information and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() - system information; requests.get() - network request to external URL.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() - sends data over the network to an external domain.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, current directory, username) collected from sources flows directly into the GET request URL parameters, which are then sent to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install command collects sensitive system information without user consent and transmits it externally during installation, which is unusual behavior for a setup script. The class and method names are obfuscated and do not serve a clear purpose, raising suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a class inheriting from the setuptools install class. Inside the custom method, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data to a webhook URL via a GET request during installation. This behavior resembles data exfiltration. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The data transmission occurs automatically upon installation, which is suspicious. No other malicious actions like code execution or file modification are present, but the exfiltration mechanism is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data collection and exfiltration during package installation, indicating malicious intent. It is likely used to secretly gather user system information. The obfuscation and unsolicited network activity confirm malicious behavior.",
