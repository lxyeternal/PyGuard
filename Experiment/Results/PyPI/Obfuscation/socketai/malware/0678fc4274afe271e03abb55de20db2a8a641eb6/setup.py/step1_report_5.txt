{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package and includes a custom install command that collects system information and sends it to a remote server via an HTTP GET request.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), and the requests.get() call which sends data to an external URL.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() function which transmits collected system data to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "During installation, system information is gathered (hostname, current directory, username) and sent via an HTTP GET request to a remote server, potentially leaking user environment data.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install command gathers and exfiltrates environment info without user consent or notification, which is unusual for a setup script. The class name and method names are obfuscated and do not follow standard conventions, indicating potential obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup-related modules and third-party libraries (requests, socket, getpass, os). It defines a class with a very obfuscated name inheriting from the install command, and overrides a method with an obfuscated name. Within this method, it collects system hostname, current working directory, and username. It then performs an HTTP GET request to an external URL, passing the collected data as parameters. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of system info during package installation, which is suspicious and not typical for benign setup scripts. The code does not appear to perform any malicious system modification but does leak user environment info externally. The obfuscated class and method names are indicators of potential malicious obfuscation or intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent, using obfuscated class and method names. It poses a security risk as it can leak user environment details to an external server, which could be used for malicious purposes.",
