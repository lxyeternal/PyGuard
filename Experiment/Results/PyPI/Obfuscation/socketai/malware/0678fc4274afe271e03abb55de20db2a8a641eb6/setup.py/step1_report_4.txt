  "flows": "Collect system info (hostname, cwd, username) -> send data via HTTP GET request to external webhook",
  "anomalies": "Code collects hostname, current working directory, and username during install and exfiltrates this data to a remote server without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during package installation, gathers sensitive environment data such as hostname, current directory, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to an external webhook URL, sending this data. This behavior is hidden within the install process and appears designed for unauthorized data collection. No other suspicious code or obfuscated constructs are present. The data exfiltration occurs without any explicit user notification or consent, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized data collection and exfiltration during package installation, indicating malicious behavior. It does not appear to serve a legitimate or benign purpose and could be used for spying or information theft.",
