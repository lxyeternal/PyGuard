{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script that, during installation, collects system information (hostname, current directory, username) and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to an external webhook URL. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an intent to conceal malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from system calls: socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function sends collected data to an external URL, acting as the sink for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "System info sources (hostname, cwd, username) flow into the requests.get() call, which transmits the data externally.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, data exfiltration during package installation without user consent, sending system info to an external server, which is unusual for benign setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data collection of system info during installation and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request. The obfuscation of class and method names indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The activity is consistent with malicious supply chain behavior, aiming to covertly gather user/system data. No other malicious actions such as code execution or persistence are present. The data exfiltration is performed without user consent, and the code's purpose aligns with malicious intent. The obfuscation and data exfiltration strongly suggest malicious activity, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The code does not contain obfuscation beyond naming, nor does it perform other malicious actions, but the exfiltration alone justifies a high severity assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation, with obfuscated naming to conceal intent. This constitutes a serious supply chain security threat. The activity is deliberate, unauthorized, and potentially harmful, justifying maximum malware and risk scores. The reports correctly identify these issues, and the scores are appropriate given the behavior.",
