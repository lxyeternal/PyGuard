{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools, but it includes a custom install class that performs malicious actions during installation.",
  "sources": "Data sources include socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), and the requests.get() call to a webhook URL.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data is sent via requests.get() to an external URL, exposing system information such as hostname, current directory, and username.",
  "flows": "The code collects system info (source) during installation and immediately sends it to an external webhook (sink), forming a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes a highly obfuscated class name and method name, and the use of requests.get() to send sensitive system data without user consent. The code does not perform any visible setup logic beyond this malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation method. During installation, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a specified webhook URL. This behavior indicates data exfiltration, which is malicious. The obfuscated class and method names further suggest malicious intent, aiming to conceal behavior. The setup call proceeds normally but the malicious code executes during install, making it a supply chain attack. No other security issues are present besides data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code designed to exfiltrate system information during installation by sending data to an external webhook. The obfuscation and data exfiltration strongly indicate malicious intent, constituting a supply chain security risk.",
