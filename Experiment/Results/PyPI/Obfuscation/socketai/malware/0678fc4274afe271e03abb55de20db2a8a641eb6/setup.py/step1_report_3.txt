{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to a remote webhook URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "Requests are sent via requests.get() to an external URL with collected data as a parameter.",
  "flows": "System information is gathered and then transmitted via an HTTP GET request to the specified webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names suggest code hiding or masking intent. The code performs data exfiltration without user consent. The use of socket, getpass, os, and requests together to send system info is suspicious. No validation or encryption of data before sending.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package. During installation, it executes a method that gathers hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a remote webhook URL. The obfuscated class and method names indicate an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The data exfiltration occurs automatically during the install process, which is suspicious, especially given the lack of user awareness or consent. No other malicious activities, such as data theft, system modification, or persistent backdoors, are evident. The code appears to be designed for covert data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and sending it to an external server during installation without user consent. It is suspicious due to obfuscated naming and automatic data exfiltration. It poses a security risk if used maliciously.",
