  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation, with obfuscated naming to conceal intent. This constitutes a serious supply chain security threat. The activity is deliberate, unauthorized, and potentially harmful, justifying maximum malware and risk scores. The reports correctly identify these issues, and the scores are appropriate given the behavior."
