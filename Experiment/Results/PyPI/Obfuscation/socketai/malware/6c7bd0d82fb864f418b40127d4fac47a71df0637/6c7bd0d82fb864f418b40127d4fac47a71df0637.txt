      "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious intent due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, triggered conditionally and with stealth features. The silent error handling further conceals potential failures. Scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8, obfuscated ~0.9, security risk ~0.85) are justified and consistent with this analysis. The behavior warrants high suspicion and further investigation or removal."
