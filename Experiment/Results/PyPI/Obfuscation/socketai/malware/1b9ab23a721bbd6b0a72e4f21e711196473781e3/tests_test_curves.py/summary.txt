  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, heavily obfuscated test suite for financial modeling classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or malicious payloads. The obfuscation is superficial and does not impact security. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware score should remain at 0."
