{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of obfuscated unit tests verifying behaviors of classes/functions related to financial modeling, including deep copies, assertions, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Input data from class method parameters, hardcoded lists within test methods, and imported classes/functions.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and exception handling within the test functions; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and internal test data through assertions and method calls, with no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, but no malicious payloads, secrets, or code injection patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple classes with test methods that perform equality checks, deep copies, and exception tests on imported classes. No external data, network activity, or system modifications are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely stylistic, and does not indicate malicious intent. The code's structure aligns with standard testing practices, and no suspicious patterns such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, heavily obfuscated test suite for financial modeling classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or malicious payloads. The obfuscation is superficial and does not impact security. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware score should remain at 0.",
