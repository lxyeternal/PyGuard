  "purpose": "The code reads supply and demand data from a JSON file, processes it using imported classes, and provides fixtures for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'tests/test_data/supply_demand_data.json' file using open() and json.loads().",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; data is processed internally and no untrusted data is sent elsewhere or used in dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "File reading source flows into json.loads, then into class constructors LivKbpPOppMDQxMrTejIPjVkZOIhPpuK and HMXBZYlMWmmSuNDrrtdzWHQlpMgMzSMV via fixtures.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No suspicious network activity or system calls. Usage of third-party libraries is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a local JSON file containing supply and demand data, loads it into memory, and creates objects of classes imported from an external package. The data access pattern is simple and typical for test setups. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The file path is fixed and local, and no user input or untrusted data is directly involved in sensitive operations. The code does not perform any unsafe operations or suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign; it loads data for testing purposes without any malicious intent or security risks. No signs of supply chain attacks or malicious behavior detected.",
