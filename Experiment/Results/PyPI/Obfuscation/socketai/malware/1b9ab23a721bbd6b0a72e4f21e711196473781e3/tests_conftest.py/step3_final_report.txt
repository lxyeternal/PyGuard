  "purpose": "Load supply/demand data from a JSON file and instantiate corresponding class objects for testing.",
  "sources": "Reading from a fixed JSON file path ('tests/test_data/supply_demand_data.json')",
  "sinks": "None; data is loaded locally and used to instantiate classes without external or untrusted data sinks",
  "flows": "File read -> JSON deserialization -> class instantiation via fixtures",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names (e.g., 'kEPKXjcJMrtHhcvpuQigAfXgkbOWcqsl', 'LivKbpPOppMDQxMrTejIPjVkZOIhPpuK')",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file reading and JSON parsing, then creates class instances for testing. No network activity, code injection, or malicious operations are present. The obfuscated names could be an attempt to hide intent but are not inherently malicious. The data flow is typical for test setup. No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a test fixture to load data and instantiate classes. The obfuscation of names raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is justified at 0.7 due to the obfuscated identifiers, and the overall security risk is low (~0.1-0.2). The code does not pose security threats and appears safe for use.",
