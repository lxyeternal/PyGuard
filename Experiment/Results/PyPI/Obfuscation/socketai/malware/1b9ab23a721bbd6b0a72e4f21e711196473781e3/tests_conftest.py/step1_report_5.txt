{
  "purpose": "The code appears to load supply and demand data from a JSON file, process it with custom classes, and set up test fixtures for unit testing.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'tests/test_data/supply_demand_data.json' file.",
  "sinks": "Data read from the file is passed into class constructors; no direct untrusted data sinks like network, database, or eval found.",
  "flows": "File read -> JSON parsing -> data passed into class instances via fixtures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. Usage of standard library and imports are typical.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a JSON file containing supply and demand data, parses it, and supplies the data to class constructors via pytest fixtures. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The file path is static but benign in context. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a test setup for supply and demand data processing with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs straightforward file I/O and data handling with standard practices.",
