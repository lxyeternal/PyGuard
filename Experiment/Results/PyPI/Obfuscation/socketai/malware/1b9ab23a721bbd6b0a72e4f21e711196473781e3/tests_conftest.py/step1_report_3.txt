{
  "purpose": "The code appears to load supply and demand data from a JSON file, process it with imported classes from a package, and provide fixtures for testing.",
  "sources": "File read operation on 'tests/test_data/supply_demand_data.json' to load JSON data",
  "sinks": "No direct sink for untrusted data; data is used to instantiate classes, and there is no network or system call present",
  "flows": "Data is read from the JSON file and passed into class constructors via fixtures; no further data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from a JSON file, deserializes it, and uses it to instantiate objects from imported classes. The JSON filename is hardcoded, but this is typical for test data. No code injection, system calls, network activity, or other malicious patterns are present. The imported modules and classes do not appear suspicious. The functions are straightforward test fixtures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test setup for loading data and creating fixtures for unit tests. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
