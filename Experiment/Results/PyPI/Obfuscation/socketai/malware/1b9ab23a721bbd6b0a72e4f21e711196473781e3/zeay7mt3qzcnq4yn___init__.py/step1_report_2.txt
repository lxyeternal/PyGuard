  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility module for handling data processing and network communication, possibly part of a larger application.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, user input, or external data files (if present).",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system writes, or data transmission functions.",
  "flows": "Input data from sources is processed and then sent over the network or saved to files.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or misleading variable names are detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing tasks with standard library functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or stealthy network communication. It does not contain any suspicious constructs like eval, exec with untrusted input, or code injection points. Usage of environment variables and network operations are typical and not suspicious in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard and does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious behavior. It appears to be a normal utility or application code with no security risks identified based on the provided content.",
