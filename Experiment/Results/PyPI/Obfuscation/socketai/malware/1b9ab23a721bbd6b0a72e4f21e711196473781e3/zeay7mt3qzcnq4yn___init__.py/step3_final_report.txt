{
  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on code patterns such as dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, and suspicious data flows.",
  "sources": "Input data reading points, such as user inputs, environment variables, network calls, or file reads.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network transmissions, file modifications, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Paths from data sources through processing functions to sinks, especially involving eval/exec or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, misleading variable names, or incomplete/minimal code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation (high in Report 1), dynamic execution (Report 4), and minimal benign patterns (Reports 2, 3, 5). Reports 1 and 4 indicate moderate suspicion, justified by obfuscation and eval/exec usage. Other reports show no suspicious activity. Scores are generally consistent with the analysis, with Report 1's high obfuscation score (0.8) and Report 4's moderate suspicion (malware 0.4, risk 0.5). Overall, the combined assessment suggests low to moderate threat levels, with a malware score around 0.3, obfuscation around 0.3, and risk approximately 0.3-0.4.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, but obfuscation and dynamic execution in some snippets warrant cautious review. The scores are appropriate and align with the observed patterns. No significant adjustments are necessary; continued vigilance is recommended for code involving eval/exec.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
