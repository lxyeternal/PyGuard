{
  "purpose": "Static package metadata including name, description, version, author, email, license, and URL, assigned to obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments with static string values; no external input or data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data flows, network calls, or code execution points.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assignments without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names that do not follow standard naming conventions; no malicious code or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments containing package metadata, with obfuscated variable names. No dynamic code, external inputs, or malicious patterns are present. The obfuscation of variable names is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The absence of data flows, sinks, or external interactions indicates a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports—malware score of 0, high obfuscation scores (~0.8), and zero security risk—are consistent with the code's nature. The high confidence levels reflect the straightforward, metadata-only content. Overall, the code is benign, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing package metadata with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are present. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, metadata-only nature.",
