  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata variables related to a Python package or project, including name, description, version, author, contact info, license, and repository URL.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for package information and metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or perform security-sensitive actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; all variables are assigned static string values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated code detected. The code consists solely of variable assignments with static strings.",
  "analysis": "The code contains straightforward variable assignments with package metadata information. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic data are used. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The structure is simple and non-obfuscated, with no suspicious or malicious patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. It is typical for package setup or documentation purposes. No malware or security concerns identified.",
