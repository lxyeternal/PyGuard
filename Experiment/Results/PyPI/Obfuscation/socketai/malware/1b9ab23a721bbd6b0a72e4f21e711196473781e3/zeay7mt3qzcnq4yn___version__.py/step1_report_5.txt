  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata and configuration information related to a Python package or project, including package name, description, version, author, contact email, license, and repository URL.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments; no input or data reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; no data leaks or external communications are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets variables with static values.",
  "anomalies": "All variables are assigned static, hard-coded strings; no unusual code structures, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of variable assignments with descriptive metadata. No inputs, external calls, or potentially malicious code are present. The static nature and lack of operations indicate no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as package metadata definitions. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
