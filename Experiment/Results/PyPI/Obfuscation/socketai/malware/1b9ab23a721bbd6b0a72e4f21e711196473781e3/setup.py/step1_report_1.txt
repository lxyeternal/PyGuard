{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that appears to fetch and display IP info, and installs a command-line tool.",
  "sources": "Reading the package version from a file (__version__.py), reading the README.md file, importing modules, and executing code from the version file.",
  "sinks": "Requests.get() call which retrieves data from an external URL and prints it, potential use of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reading version data -> executing it -> printing data fetched from https://ipinfo.io/json",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names (e.g., 'STMLNaQkNVipaKtAiTAyOJpuvtBknfjF', 'swafPnBWYaQJokGVtZjoZEpMZpkRjJAH'), the request to 'https://ipinfo.io/json' executed at install time which could leak environment info, use of exec() to execute code from a file, and reading files that might be externally controlled or manipulated.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a setup toolkit, defining a class with an obfuscated name inheriting from 'install'. Within a method of this class, it performs an HTTP GET request to 'https://ipinfo.io/json' and prints the response, which could leak system or network information during installation. It reads the version information from an external file via exec(), which can be risky if the file is compromised. The code also reads a README file for description. The obfuscated variable names and the external request at install time are suspicious and could indicate malicious intent or unwanted behavior such as information leakage. No signs of malware like file modification, backdoors, or system harm are evident outside the info leakage via requests.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated with misleading variable names and performs an external HTTP request during installation, which can be considered malicious or at least undesirable in a supply chain context. It leaks system information by contacting an external service at install time, raising security concerns. No other malicious activity such as code injection or backdoors is apparent. Overall, this package poses a security risk due to info leakage.",
