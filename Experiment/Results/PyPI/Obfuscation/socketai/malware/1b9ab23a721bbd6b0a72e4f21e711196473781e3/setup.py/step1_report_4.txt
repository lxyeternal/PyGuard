  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that also performs an external request during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the version file (__version__.py), reading the README.md file, importing modules, and executing code in the setup process.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URL (https://ipinfo.io/json) during installation; reading version info from a file; executing potentially external code from __version__.py.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code reads version info from a local file, then makes an HTTP GET request to an external server (https://ipinfo.io/json), printing the response. This occurs within the custom install command.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class performs an unsolicited GET request to an external IP info service, which is unusual for a typical setup script. The class name and method names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which may indicate malicious intent or obfuscation. The code executes a read of version data dynamically, which might conceal malicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, upon execution, makes an HTTP request to retrieve and print IP-related info from an external service, which is unusual for a package installation process. The obfuscated class and method names suggest possible concealment. The script reads version data dynamically, potentially hiding malicious modifications. The setup configuration references this custom command and includes a typical list of dependencies and metadata, but the external request during install is suspicious. No direct evidence of malicious payload like data theft or backdoors is present, but the external request is concerning and not justified as part of a normal package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior with the external HTTP request embedded within a custom installation class, along with obfuscated naming. While there is no definitive malicious payload, the behavior is atypical and could be used to fingerprint or track system info during installation. The presence of obfuscation and unsolicited external requests warrants caution.",
