{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes custom installation behavior and metadata definitions.",
  "sources": "Reading '__version__.py' for version info, reading 'README.md' for long description, executing code during setup, and making an HTTP request during installation.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP request to 'https://ipinfo.io/json' potentially leaks system information. Execution of code read from '__version__.py' is a sink if the content is malicious. The setup process itself could be manipulated if the setup script is malicious.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code reads version info from a file and executes it, then makes an HTTP GET request to an external URL, potentially leaking system info. The execution flow from reading and executing '__version__.py' to the installation process and external request forms the main flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming conventions and obfuscated class and variable names suggest code obfuscation or concealment. The code performs an HTTP request to a third-party URL during installation, which is suspicious. The execution of the content of '__version__.py' without validation can be risky if the file is malicious. The class name and method names appear intentionally obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that performs a system info request from 'ipinfo.io' during installation, which may leak user IP and system info. The class name and method names are intentionally obfuscated, likely to hide behavior. The setup reads version info from a file using exec(), which could execute malicious code if the '__version__.py' file is compromised. The script does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obvious malicious payloads, but the external request and code execution are suspicious. Overall, the script is primarily a standard setup with obfuscation and potential information leakage during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and performs a potentially privacy-invasive HTTP request during installation. The execution of external file content without validation is a security concern. The setup script appears to be malicious or at least suspicious due to obfuscation and data leakage behavior, warranting caution.",
