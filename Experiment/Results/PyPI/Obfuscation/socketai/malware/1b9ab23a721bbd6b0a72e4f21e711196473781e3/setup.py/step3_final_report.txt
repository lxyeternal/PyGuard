{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that performs an external IP info request and executes code from an external version file, with obfuscated class and variable names, indicating potential concealment and privacy concerns.",
  "sources": "The requests.get call to 'https://ipinfo.io/json' during installation, reading and executing external '__version__.py' via exec().",
  "sinks": "The external IP info request could leak environment data; exec() executes external code which could be malicious if compromised.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code performs an external HTTP GET request and executes code from an external file, potentially leading to data leakage or malicious code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, external request during setup, use of exec() on external file, all indicative of concealment and suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code makes an external request to 'https://ipinfo.io/json' during installation, which can leak system info. It uses exec() on an external file, risking execution of malicious code. Obfuscated names suggest concealment. No direct malicious payloads like backdoors or destructive actions are present, but the behaviors are suspicious and could be exploited for malicious tracking or data exfiltration. The external request and obfuscation increase the security concern, though no active malware is confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "The package exhibits suspicious behaviors such as privacy-invasive external requests and obfuscation, with potential for malicious activity. While no direct malware is detected, these indicators justify a high security risk assessment and warrant further review before use.",
