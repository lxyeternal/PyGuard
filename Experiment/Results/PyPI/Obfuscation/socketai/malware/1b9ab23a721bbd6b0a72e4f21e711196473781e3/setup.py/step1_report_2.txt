{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with custom installation behavior, including fetching external data during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version information from an external file '__version__.py' and the README.md file for long description. It also imports and potentially executes code during installation, specifically in the custom class 'STMLNaQkNVipaKtAiTAyOJpuvtBknfjF'.",
  "sinks": "The code makes an HTTP GET request to 'https://ipinfo.io/json' during the custom install step, which can leak system information or IP address. It executes external code via 'exec(f.read(), ...)', which can execute arbitrary code from the version file.",
  "flows": "Input from '__version__.py' is executed with 'exec', leading to potential execution of malicious code. During installation, a request to 'https://ipinfo.io/json' occurs, leaking IP info. The setup process reads the README and version data but does not sanitize or validate it.",
  "anomalies": "The class name 'STMLNaQkNVipaKtAiTAyOJpuvtBknfjF' appears obfuscated or randomly generated. The method 'XptvaGNtdhnFZuDlvPQFLBcdGdngczKE' is an unusual name, indicating obfuscation. The code fetches and prints IP info during installation, which is suspicious. Use of 'exec' on external files is risky.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during execution, fetches and prints IP information from an external service, which could leak user data. It also reads and executes code from an external version file, which may contain malicious code or hidden backdoors. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The rest of the setup uses typical package configuration, but the inclusion of network requests and dynamic code execution are security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs typical package setup tasks but includes suspicious behaviors such as executing external code and making network requests to an IP info service during installation. The obfuscated code and external code execution significantly increase the risk of malicious activity or backdoors. Overall, this package should be considered high risk without further verification.",
