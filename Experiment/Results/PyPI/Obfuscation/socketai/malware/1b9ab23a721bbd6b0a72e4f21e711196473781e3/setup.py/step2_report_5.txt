  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports note the obfuscated class and variable names, which is suspicious.\n- All mention the external request to `https://ipinfo.io/json` during installation, which could leak environment info.\n- Multiple reports highlight the use of `exec()` on external files (`__version__.py`), which can execute malicious code if the file is compromised.\n- The `malware` scores are generally low (around 0.2 to 0.75), but some are quite high, reflecting potential malicious activity.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are correspondingly high where external info leakage and obfuscation are noted.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- **External HTTP request during install:** The code performs a GET request to `https://ipinfo.io/json` within the custom install class, which is executed during package installation. This can leak system or network info.\n- **Obfuscated class and method names:** These obscure the code's intent and are typical of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Use of `exec()` on external files:** Reading and executing code from `__version__.py` without validation is risky.\n- **Potential information leakage:** The external request could be used for fingerprinting or tracking.\n\n**No evidence of code modification, backdoors, or destructive payloads** outside the info leakage behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Setup with info leakage.\n- **Key issues:** External request, obfuscation, `exec()`.\n- **Risk score:** 0.7 (justified due to info leakage and obfuscation).\n- **Malware score:** 0.2 (no direct malware observed).\n- **Verdict:** The behavior is suspicious but not definitively malicious.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar setup with external data fetch.\n- **Key issues:** Obfuscated class/method names, external request, dynamic code execution.\n- **Risk score:** 0.8 (high due to combined suspicious behaviors).\n- **Malware score:** 0.75 (higher, reflecting potential malicious intent).\n- **Verdict:** The combination of obfuscation, external requests, and code execution warrants high concern.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Setup with external request.\n- **Key issues:** External request, obfuscation, no malicious payload detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.4 (moderate, primarily privacy concern).\n- **Malware score:** 0.2.\n- **Verdict:** Less suspicious, more about privacy leakage.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Setup with external request.\n- **Key issues:** Obfuscated class/method names, external request.\n- **Risk score:** 0.4.\n- **Malware score:** 0.2.\n- **Verdict:** Similar to report 3, potential privacy concern.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Setup with external request.\n- **Key issues:** Obfuscation, external request, `exec()`.\n- **Risk score:** 0.55.\n- **Malware score:** 0.2.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly higher risk due to `exec()` and obfuscation, but no direct malicious payload.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- **Risk scores:** The external request during installation is a significant privacy concern, especially if it occurs without user consent. Obfuscation suggests an attempt to conceal behavior, raising suspicion.\n- **Malware scores:** No evidence of malicious payloads like code injection, backdoors, or destructive actions. The malware score remains low, but the potential for malicious intent exists given the obfuscation and info leakage.\n\n### Consistency and suggestions:\n\n- The scores seem reasonable given the behaviors described.\n- For reports with high obfuscation and external requests (like report 2), a malware score of 0.75 is justified.\n- For less suspicious reports, the scores are appropriately lower.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** ~0.2–0.3 (mostly based on the absence of direct malicious payloads)\n- **Obfuscated:** ~0.7–0.9 (all reports mention obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** ~0.5–0.75 (due to external info leakage and obfuscation)\n\n**My overall conservative estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.2** (no direct malicious code observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.8** (consistent obfuscation across reports)\n- **Risk:** **0.65** (significant privacy concern, potential for malicious intent if code is malicious)\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n\n- The package exhibits behaviors that are suspicious and potentially malicious, especially with external info leakage and obfuscation.\n- Further static and dynamic analysis would be necessary to confirm malicious payloads.\n- The current scores reflect a cautious stance given the obfuscation and external network activity.\n\n**In conclusion, I recommend treating this package as high risk until further investigation confirms its safety.**",
