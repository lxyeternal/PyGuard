  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward but potentially risky due to external script execution and obfuscation. No malicious payloads are present in this snippet, but the pattern warrants caution. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily depending on the trustworthiness of 'my_script.py'. The malware score should remain low unless further malicious activity is identified."
