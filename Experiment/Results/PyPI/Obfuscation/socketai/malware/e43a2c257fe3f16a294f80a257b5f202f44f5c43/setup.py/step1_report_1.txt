{
  "purpose": "The code aims to set up a Python package called 'seleniumunclickable' with certain dependencies and a custom install step that downloads and executes a Python script from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The URL embedded in the variable 'keTSHnTFkoMftbhuPKBswHaWaORxpYoq' which points to a remote resource; the request to fetch content via 'requests.get'; the download of 'qrcodegen.py'; execution of the downloaded script with subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'qrcodegen.py' via subprocess, which could run arbitrary code; downloading code from an external URL and executing it poses significant risks.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves content from a remote URL, saves it as 'qrcodegen.py', then executes it, creating a direct source-to-sink flow that could execute malicious code if the remote content is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; dynamically fetching and executing remote code during package installation; no verification or validation of downloaded content; potential for executing malicious code during setup.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that, during package installation, fetches a Python script from a remote URL and executes it. The URL is constructed from variables that are concatenated, but ultimately points to a remote resource. Downloading and executing code without validation is highly suspicious and indicates potential malicious intent. The setup configuration is typical but includes this malicious install step. No other malicious behaviors such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated payloads are evident. The code’s primary concern is the dynamic remote code execution during package installation, which is a common tactic for supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious behavior where it downloads and executes a remote Python script during installation without validation. This represents a significant security risk and is indicative of malicious intent. The overall security risk score is high due to this dynamic remote code execution.",
