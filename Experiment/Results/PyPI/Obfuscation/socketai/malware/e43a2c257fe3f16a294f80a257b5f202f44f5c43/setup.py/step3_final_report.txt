{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a remote Python script during package installation and executes it without validation, indicating malicious intent and potential supply chain attack behavior.",
  "sources": "The URL constructed from obfuscated variables, requests.get() fetching the script, and the open() writing to 'qrcodegen.py'.",
  "sinks": "The content fetched from the remote URL is written to a file and then executed via subprocess.check_call(), leading to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves remote content -> content written to 'qrcodegen.py' -> subprocess executes the script, executing remote code during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic URL construction, remote code fetch and execution during package setup, no validation or signature verification.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an obfuscated URL, fetches a Python script from it, saves it locally, and executes it during installation. This pattern indicates malicious behavior, as it allows remote code execution without validation. The obfuscation of variable names and URL parts suggests an intent to hide malicious activity. The remote code execution during setup poses a high security risk, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution on user systems. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9, obfuscated 0.8, securityRisk 0.9) are justified given the behavior. All reports correctly identify the malicious pattern, and their reasoning aligns with the code's actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high-severity supply chain attack pattern by downloading and executing remote code during package installation. The behavior is malicious, and the high scores assigned are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary; the reports accurately reflect the security threat.",
