      "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high-severity supply chain attack pattern by downloading and executing remote code during package installation. The behavior is malicious, and the high scores assigned are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary; the reports accurately reflect the security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code unconditionally executes an external script via an obfuscated function, posing a moderate security risk if the script is malicious. Obfuscation and external execution warrant caution, but no direct malicious activity is evident within this snippet. The overall risk is moderate, and further validation of 'my_script.py' is recommended."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is straightforward but potentially risky due to external script execution and obfuscation. No malicious payloads are present in this snippet, but the pattern warrants caution. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily depending on the trustworthiness of 'my_script.py'. The malware score should remain low unless further malicious activity is identified."
