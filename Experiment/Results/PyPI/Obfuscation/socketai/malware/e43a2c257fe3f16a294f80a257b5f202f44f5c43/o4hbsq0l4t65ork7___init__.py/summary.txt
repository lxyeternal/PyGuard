  "conclusion": "The code unconditionally executes an external script via an obfuscated function, posing a moderate security risk if the script is malicious. Obfuscation and external execution warrant caution, but no direct malicious activity is evident within this snippet. The overall risk is moderate, and further validation of 'my_script.py' is recommended."
