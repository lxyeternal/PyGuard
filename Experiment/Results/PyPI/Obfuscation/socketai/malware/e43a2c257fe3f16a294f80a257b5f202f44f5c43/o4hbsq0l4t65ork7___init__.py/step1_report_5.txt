  "purpose": "Execute an external Python script named 'my_script.py' through a function call.",
  "sources": "The os.system call executing 'python my_script.py'.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call where untrusted command execution could occur if the input was manipulated.",
  "flows": "Main execution flow calls the function, which then executes an external script via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function name, which may be an attempt to hide intent. The code executes an external script without any validation or sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a nonsensical name that runs 'python my_script.py' via os.system. The main block calls this function. The direct execution of an external script through os.system is a potential security risk, especially if 'my_script.py' is not controlled or verified. The obfuscated function name suggests an attempt to conceal its purpose. No other suspicious code or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden malicious commands is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary behavior is to run an external Python script, which could be benign or malicious depending on 'my_script.py'. The obfuscated function name and direct system call raise concerns about potential malicious intent or hidden behavior, especially if the script's origin is untrusted.",
