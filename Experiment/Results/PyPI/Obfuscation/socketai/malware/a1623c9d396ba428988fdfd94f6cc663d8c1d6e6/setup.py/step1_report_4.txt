  "anomalies": [

    "Hardcoded string `gQuZkNKdciQLtCsaNjvxgUxHDolDBjCe` that is unused",
    "No clear malicious behavior in file reading or regex, but the obfuscation is suspicious",
    "Potential for external file manipulation since version string is read from a file, but no direct malicious behavior evident"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package, with obfuscated function and variable names. It reads a version string from a file relative to the script's directory and uses regex to extract the version. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation might be intended to hide malicious intent, but as written, the code only performs typical setup tasks. The hardcoded string and obfuscation are suspicious but do not inherently indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script with obfuscated elements. No malicious or malicious-sounding behavior is evident; it appears to be a typical package setup with obfuscation, which could be for benign reasons or to conceal malicious intent. Due to the obfuscation and unused variables, there is some suspicion, but no concrete evidence of malicious activity.",
