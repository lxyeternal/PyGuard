  "conclusion": "The script is mainly a benign demonstration of colored output with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score should remain low. Overall security risk is minimal but warrants caution if part of a larger, unknown codebase."
