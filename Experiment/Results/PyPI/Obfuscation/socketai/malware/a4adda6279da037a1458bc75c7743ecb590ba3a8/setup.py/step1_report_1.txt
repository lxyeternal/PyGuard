{
  "purpose": "The code sets up the configuration for packaging and distributing a Python CLI tool related to AWS.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from __init__.py, reads README.rst, imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, reads sys.argv, reads files from filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is directly executed or causes security effects.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and long description, configures setup options, conditionally includes py2exe options based on sys.argv.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. No evidence of data exfiltration, network connections, or malicious code. Use of standard setup tools and dependencies. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package metadata and setup configuration for a Python project. It reads version info from a file, constructs installation requirements, and conditionally adds options for py2exe. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network connections, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply defines package metadata, dependencies, and build options.",
