{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing an AWS CLI tool using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a Python file, reads long description from README, and specifies dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no network or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "The script reads version and description info, then passes configuration to setup(), with no data flow to external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code imports 'py2exe' only if specified in command-line args, which is a standard build tool.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading files, extracting version info, defining dependencies, and configuring build options. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The inclusion of py2exe setup is conditional and typical for Windows packaging. All code appears to serve legitimate packaging purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, specifically an AWS CLI tool. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No security issues are identified.",
