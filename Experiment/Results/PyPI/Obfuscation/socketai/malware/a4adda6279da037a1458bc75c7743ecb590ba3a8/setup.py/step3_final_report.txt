  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the AWS CLI Python project, defining dependencies, versioning, and conditional build options.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from __init__.py, reads README.rst for description, imports modules, and conditionally includes py2exe options based on sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network connections, code execution, or external data handling beyond file reads.",
  "flows": "Reads version and description files, sets up package configuration, conditionally imports py2exe, and executes setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Conditional import of py2exe is standard for Windows packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. It performs standard package configuration tasks, reads version info, and includes optional Windows build support. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports accurately assess the code as safe, and no modifications are necessary.",
