  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the content, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as primarily documentation, type annotations, and parameter definitions for a plugin system.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or network activity is present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code snippets are identified.\n- The scores assigned are predominantly 0.9 or 1 for confidence, with malware and security risk scores at 0, which aligns with the content.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes parameter types and documentation.\n- **Analysis:** No executable code, no untrusted data handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard API documentation.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n- **Scores:** Same as above, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Also consistent, describing parameters and return types.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, security risk 0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Same pattern, no executable logic or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Consistent with prior assessments, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), still reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely descriptive, with no executable or malicious content.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable given the absence of suspicious elements.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n- The security risk score is also 0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Based on the provided code snippet and reports:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is purely documentation and type annotations.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources.\n- No executable logic, network activity, or data sinks are present.\n- The consistent, high confidence scores reflect the thorough review.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current scores are appropriate and justified. No adjustments are necessary. The code appears safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and poses no security risk based on the provided snippet and reports.",
