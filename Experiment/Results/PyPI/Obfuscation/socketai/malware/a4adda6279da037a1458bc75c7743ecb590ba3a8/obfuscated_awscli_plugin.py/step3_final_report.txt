  "purpose": "Documentation and type annotations for a plugin management function, defining plugin mappings, event hooks, and inclusion of built-in plugins.",
  "sources": "Parameter definitions and docstrings describing input parameters; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, external calls, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; the code is purely descriptive with no data flows or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward documentation and type annotations without suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of parameter type annotations and descriptive docstrings for a plugin system. There are no executable components, network activities, or data flows involving untrusted sources. The code is human-readable, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious constructs. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the absence of any security concerns. Confidence is high (1), given the clear and safe nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard documentation for a plugin interface, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
