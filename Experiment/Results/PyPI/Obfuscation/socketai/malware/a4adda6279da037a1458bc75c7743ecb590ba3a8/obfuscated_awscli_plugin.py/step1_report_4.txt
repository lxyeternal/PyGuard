{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define parameter annotations and a function signature for a plugin system, likely related to event handling and plugin management in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources such as user input, environment variables, or network inputs are evident in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as file writes, network calls, or system modifications are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are detectable within the provided code snippet since it only contains type annotations and a function signature without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a typical function signature with docstrings, no suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of parameter type annotations, a docstring explaining the parameters and return value, and a function signature. There are no actual code execution, data processing, or security-sensitive operations shown. It does not include any sources of untrusted data, no sinks where data could leak or cause harm, and no visible flows. It appears to be part of a well-structured, standard plugin system setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks in this code snippet. It is a straightforward, well-documented function interface with no detectable malicious elements.",
