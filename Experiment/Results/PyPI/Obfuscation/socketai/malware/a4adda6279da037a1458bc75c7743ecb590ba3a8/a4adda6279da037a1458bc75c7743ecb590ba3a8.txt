The slight elevation in security risk scores (0.2) is overly cautious given the lack of actual code; these should be lowered to 0.0 for a more accurate assessment. Overall, the supply chain security posture based on these descriptions is minimal risk, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation."

The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscated at 0, and security risk at 0 or very close to it. Overall, the code is safe for use in any context where string parsing of CLI options is needed."
