  "purpose": "The code comments describe dynamically retrieving choices from command table keys and overriding a 'hidden' method, indicating flexible design but no executable code.",
  "sources": "No actual data input or data reading functions; only descriptive comments.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or points where untrusted data could cause leaks or effects; only comments.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow present; comments do not specify any runtime behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, only descriptive comments; no anomalies or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The provided content consists solely of comments describing dynamic choice retrieval and method overriding. No code snippets, data flows, or executable logic are present. The comments are typical for flexible Python code and do not indicate malicious intent or security risks. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the risk score is zero, aligning with the absence of any security concerns. Confidence is high that there is no malicious activity or obfuscation, given the lack of code. Overall, the code appears benign, with no signs of sabotage or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code review indicates no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The comments are standard documentation of design choices without executable or suspicious elements. Therefore, the overall security posture is benign, and no action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
