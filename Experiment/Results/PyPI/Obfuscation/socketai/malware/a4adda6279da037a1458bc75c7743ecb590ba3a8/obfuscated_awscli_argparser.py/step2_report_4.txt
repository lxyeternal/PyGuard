  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence for malicious activity, code behavior, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports are based solely on comments or documentation describing dynamic retrieval of choices and method overriding.\n- No actual code snippets, data flows, or executable logic are provided.\n- The comments mention advanced techniques like dynamic choice retrieval and method overriding, which are common in Python and not inherently malicious.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or data leaks are indicated.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious code.\n- The confidence scores are high where comments are detailed (reports 4 and 5), and lower where comments are less confident (reports 1 and 2), which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis per report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Describes dynamic choices from command table keys.\n- No code or data flow, only comments.\n- Malware: 0, security risk: 0, which is appropriate.\n- Confidence: 0.2 — low, due to the minimal info.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar, describing dynamic retrieval and method override.\n- No code or data flow.\n- Malware: 0, security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 0.3 — slightly higher, but still low.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Similar descriptive comment.\n- No executable code.\n- Malware: 0, security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 0.9 — high, reflecting detailed confidence.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same pattern.\n- No code.\n- Malware: 0, security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar descriptive comment.\n- No code.\n- Malware: 0, security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1 — very high, due to detailed comments.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports are based on comments/documentation, not executable code.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The assigned scores for malware and security risk are consistent with the content.\n- Confidence scores are appropriate given the information provided.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The overall assessment aligns with the provided data.\n- Since no actual code or data flows are present, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- Confidence scores are appropriate, reflecting the level of certainty based on the descriptive nature of the reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Security risk:** 0 across all reports.\n\n**Overall:** No security concerns are evident from the provided comments, and the scoring accurately reflects that.",
