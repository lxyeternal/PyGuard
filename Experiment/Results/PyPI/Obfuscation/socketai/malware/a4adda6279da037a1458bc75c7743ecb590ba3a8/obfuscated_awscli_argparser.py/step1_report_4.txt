{
  "purpose": "Describes behavior related to dynamic retrieval of choices for an argument and discusses overriding a method, likely in a command or CLI context.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources, no data reading operations are visible.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external calls, or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified; the snippet is a commentary or documentation, not executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only descriptive comments; no executable code, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The provided text is purely a comment or documentation explaining design choices regarding argument choices and method overriding. There is no actual code present to analyze for security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. No data sources or sinks are involved, and no unusual code patterns are detected. The description hints at dynamic behavior, but without actual code, no security concerns can be identified.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a non-executable comment describing intended behavior and design considerations. No malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation are evident. Therefore, the overall security risk is negligible, and there is no malware or malicious behavior present.",
