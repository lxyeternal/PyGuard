  "purpose": "Documentation or comment describing dynamic retrieval of choices from a command table and method override considerations.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; mentions dynamic retrieval from a command table.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; no code execution or data handling shown.",
  "flows": "No code or data flow demonstrated in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The snippet discusses dynamic choices and overriding methods, which could imply dynamic behavior, but no actual code or malicious activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The provided text appears to be a descriptive comment rather than executable code. It discusses design considerations such as mutable choices derived from command table keys and method overriding practices. There is no evidence of code execution, data handling, or any suspicious behavior. No embedded code, external inputs, or data flows are visible, making it unlikely to contain malicious code or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a descriptive comment rather than actual code; no malicious behavior or security risks are present. The content reflects design choices and best practices concerns but does not execute or manipulate data in a way that would pose security threats.",
