  "conclusion": "All reports accurately reflect the absence of executable code or malicious behavior. The malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero. The slight elevation in security risk scores (0.2) is overly cautious given the lack of actual code; these should be lowered to 0.0 for a more accurate assessment. Overall, the supply chain security posture based on these descriptions is minimal risk, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation."
