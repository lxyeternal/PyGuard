  "flows": "N/A (no executable code or data flow paths identified).",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, scripts, or suspicious patterns; purely descriptive.",
  "analysis": "The reports are high-level descriptions or documentation snippets without embedded code or executable components. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or anomalies are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given the lack of code. The security risk scores are conservatively set at 0.2 in some reports, likely reflecting cautious consideration of potential misuse of environment variables or user input, but without concrete evidence, these could be lowered to 0.1 or 0.0. Confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty that no malicious code or obfuscation exists based on the provided descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately reflect the absence of executable code or malicious behavior. The malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero. The slight elevation in security risk scores (0.2) is overly cautious given the lack of actual code; these should be lowered to 0.0 for a more accurate assessment. Overall, the supply chain security posture based on these descriptions is minimal risk, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
