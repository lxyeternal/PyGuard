  "anomalies": "No code provided; only description of a CLI tool. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malicious behaviors evident.",
  "analysis": "The description suggests a CLI utility for AWS, likely utilizing AWS SDKs or CLI commands. No code is provided to analyze for malicious behaviors such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. As an open-source CLI tool, its security depends on proper handling of credentials and secure API calls. Without source code or implementation details, no malicious behavior or security risks can be identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the description, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The tool appears to be a standard AWS CLI environment. Further analysis would require access to source code or detailed implementation.",
