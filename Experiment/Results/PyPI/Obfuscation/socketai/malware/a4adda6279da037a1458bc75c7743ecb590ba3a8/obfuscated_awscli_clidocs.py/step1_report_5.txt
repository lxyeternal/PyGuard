{
  "purpose": "The code appears to describe a mechanism for registering and unregistering event handlers for document events based on handler methods defined in an object.",
  "sources": "It reads documentation comments or description strings about event registration and unregistration processes.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as data outputs, network operations, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "N/A — no executable data flow is present; the text is descriptive documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected; the code is purely descriptive and lacks executable logic.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a textual description of event registration/unregistration functions, not executable code. It explains that default register/unregister methods iterate through document events and connect or disconnect handler methods if they exist. No code execution, data processing, or system interaction occurs. No embedded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present. The content is consistent with standard event handling documentation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The fragment is purely descriptive documentation explaining event handler registration logic. It contains no executable code, data flow, or malicious behavior. There are no security concerns or anomalies present.",
