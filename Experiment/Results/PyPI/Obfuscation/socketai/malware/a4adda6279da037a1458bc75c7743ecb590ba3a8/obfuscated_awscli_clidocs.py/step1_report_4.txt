  "purpose": "Describes the process of registering and unregistering event handlers for document events within a system.",
  "sources": "Reading internal documentation strings and comments; no input or external data sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data, system commands, or external communications identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present; code appears to define event handling methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a descriptive explanation of registering and unregistering event handlers based on available document events and associated handler methods. It uses standard programming constructs without dynamic execution, external input handling, or suspicious operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code injections. The content appears to be part of a larger framework or documentation, not executable malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment does not contain malware or malicious intent. It is a straightforward description of event handler registration logic with no security risks identified.",
