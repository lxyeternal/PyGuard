      "conclusion": "The primary concern is with the code in Report 1, which exhibits dynamic execution and hardcoded secrets, warranting a cautious malware score of approximately 0.4 and a security risk around 0.7. Other reports appropriately reflect minimal or no malicious activity due to lack of code. Overall, the scores are justified and consistent with the evidence, with a slight adjustment to Report 1's malware and risk scores to better reflect the potential severity."
