{
  "purpose": "The function appears to be a simple print statement indicating that a package or module has been installed.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points are present; the code only prints to the console.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present, as there are no data inputs or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is an obfuscated, nonsensical string, which could be intended to hide purpose. The code is minimal and does not perform any complex or suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obscure name that, when called, outputs a static message 'installed'. There are no data inputs, no network connections, no data leaks, and no malicious operations. The obfuscated name may be an attempt to disguise simple behavior, but it does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The code is extremely simple and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a trivial print statement with an obfuscated function name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. The overall risk is very low.",
