{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform malicious activities during package installation, including contacting suspicious URLs, downloading an executable, and executing it silently, potentially leading to system compromise.",
  "sources": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs; downloads a file; executes the downloaded file via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Executing the downloaded executable via os.system; network requests to suspicious domains; silent exception handling that may hide failures.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> HTTP request to 'linkedopports.com' -> download of 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe' from 'python-release.com' -> execution of the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; broad try-except block suppressing errors; downloading and executing external code during setup; use of suspicious URLs; platform-specific code only running on Windows.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves system info, contacts suspicious URLs, downloads an executable, and runs it silently during installation. Obfuscated names and broad exception handling are typical of malicious scripts. The URLs are suspicious, and executing remote code poses a high security risk. The behavior aligns with supply chain malware tactics, indicating malicious intent with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including remote code download and execution, obfuscation, and use of suspicious URLs. It should be classified as malware with a high security risk, and its use should be avoided.",
