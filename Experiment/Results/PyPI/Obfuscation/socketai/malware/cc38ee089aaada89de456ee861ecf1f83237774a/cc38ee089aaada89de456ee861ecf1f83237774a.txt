      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and a misused argument, raising suspicion but no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The primary concern is obfuscation, which could be used to hide malicious intent, but none is visible here. The package name and argument misuse suggest potential concealment or misconfiguration, warranting further review before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior—downloading and executing a remote binary without validation—making it highly dangerous. Obfuscation further indicates malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with this analysis."
