{
  "purpose": "Minimal setup script defining package metadata and dependencies with obfuscated naming.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call, listing dependencies, and obfuscated variable/package names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; dependencies could be misused if combined with malicious code elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The code imports setup, assigns version, and calls setup() with dependencies; no data flow indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated package name and variable name; dependencies that can be misused; no malicious code or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. Dependencies include potentially sensitive libraries but are common in automation or scraping contexts. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. Malware score is 0.1 due to potential misuse of dependencies; obfuscation score is around 0.6 reflecting non-descriptive naming; security risk score is approximately 0.3 considering obfuscation and dependencies. The code's functionality is benign, but obfuscation warrants cautious review of the actual package contents.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation and common dependencies. No evidence of malicious activity or backdoors. The overall security risk is low, but obfuscation and dependency usage suggest monitoring before deployment.",
