{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility module for handling user input, processing data, and performing network requests, likely part of a larger application.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., reading from stdin), environment variables, configuration files, or network data sources.",
  "sinks": "Network requests (e.g., HTTP calls), file writing/reading, execution of system commands or subprocesses, potentially sensitive data handling (credentials, environment variables).",
  "flows": "Data from input sources or environment variables flows into processing functions, which may then send data over network requests or write to files. Untrusted data could potentially reach network sinks or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network domains or IP addresses. No hidden or unusual dynamic code execution detected. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input collection, data processing, and network operations typical of many applications. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries is standard. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected in code flow. The functions handle data securely in the context of normal operation, and no hardcoded secrets are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility or application logic with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe, with typical data handling and network communication. No malicious or suspicious behavior was identified.",
