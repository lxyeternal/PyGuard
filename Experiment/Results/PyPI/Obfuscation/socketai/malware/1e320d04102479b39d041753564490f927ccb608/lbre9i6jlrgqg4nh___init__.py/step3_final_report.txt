  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, untrusted data flows.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, code execution points, network connections, or file modifications if malicious code exists.",
  "flows": "Untrusted sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) to dangerous sinks (eval, network).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, minimal or missing code, suspicious data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code is mostly benign with straightforward structure, no suspicious patterns, and no malicious indicators. Report 2 indicates signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying higher malware and risk scores. Other reports show no suspicious activity, with scores aligned accordingly. The scores are consistent with the descriptions and observed behaviors. No significant revisions are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears generally safe, with one report indicating potential malicious obfuscation and dynamic execution. The scoring reflects these findings accurately. Overall, the supply chain risk is low, with a notable exception in Report 2.",
