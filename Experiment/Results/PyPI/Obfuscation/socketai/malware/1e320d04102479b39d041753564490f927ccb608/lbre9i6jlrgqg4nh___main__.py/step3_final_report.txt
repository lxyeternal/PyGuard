  "purpose": "Analysis of Python code for potential malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on dynamic execution, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, and suspicious data flows.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, external modules, command-line arguments, network calls, hardcoded data, dynamic code execution functions (eval(), exec()).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data leading to code execution, data leaks, network communication, file operations, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or environment variables flow into eval()/exec() or network calls, potentially leading to malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, hardcoded URLs or credentials, obfuscation or complex code structures, dynamic imports, suspicious data patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits risky behaviors primarily through eval()/exec() usage, which can be exploited if input is untrusted. The presence of hardcoded credentials or URLs suggests malicious intent or sabotage. Obfuscation or complex code structures increase suspicion. In benign cases, such functions are used for legitimate dynamic behaviors, but their untrusted context raises security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports reflect these observations, with higher malware and obfuscation scores correlating with more suspicious features. The confidence levels are appropriate given the evidence, and the overall risk assessments align with the identified signals.",
  "conclusion": "Report 3 presents strong indicators of malicious activity, justified by high malware (0.6), obfuscation (0.7), and risk (0.8) scores. Reports 1 and 2 correctly identify risks associated with eval()/exec() but do not confirm malicious intent, warranting moderate scores. Reports 4 and 5 are benign, with no suspicious features. The scores are consistent with the evidence, but for Report 1, increasing the malware score slightly to 0.2–0.3 and the risk to around 0.4–0.5 would better reflect the potential danger posed by eval()/exec() functions, even in the absence of confirmed malicious activity.",
