  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to some form of data processing or utility functions, but the actual intent cannot be determined definitively without more context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'input_data' variable and possibly from environment variables or external sources if present. No explicit input functions or external data sources are visible.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, log functions, or data transmitted over network connections if present. No clear sinks like network calls, file writes, or system modifications are visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source variables through processing functions or computations, but without external or untrusted data inputs, no direct source-to-sink malicious flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious variable names are detected. The code appears straightforward with standard syntax and structure.",
  "analysis": "A careful review of the code shows no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, does not raise suspicion. The code does not manipulate environment variables insecurely nor execute dynamic code. No anomalies or red flags are present in the visible structure or logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and does not exhibit signs of malware, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities.",
