  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, hardcoded strings, and possibly user input (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess executions, if present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, hardcoded strings) to sinks (network, file, subprocess), if such paths exist.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors detected. No unusual language features or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is examined thoroughly for signs of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard Python features and libraries without obfuscated constructs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are evident. The code appears to serve benign utility functions. Absence of suspicious data flows, hardcoded sensitive info, or unusual behaviors suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility or application code with no malicious intent.",
