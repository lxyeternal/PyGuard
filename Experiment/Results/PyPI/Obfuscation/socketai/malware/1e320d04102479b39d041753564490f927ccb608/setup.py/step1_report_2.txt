  "sinks": "subprocess.run (executes 'bypass.py'), git.Repo.clone_from (clones potentially malicious repo), requests (potential data leaks if used maliciously)",
  "flows": "Code uses subprocess to run 'bypass.py' after cloning repo; cloning repo can introduce malicious code; subprocess execution may run malicious scripts",
  "anomalies": "Cloning external repository from a fixed URL; running a script ('bypass.py') from that repo without validation; hardcoded URL and paths; no input validation or security checks",
  "analysis": "The code installs 'gitpython' dynamically via subprocess, clones a remote GitHub repository into a specific directory, then executes a script ('bypass.py') from that repository. The cloning of an external repository and executing its script can be malicious if the repository contains harmful code. No security measures or validation are in place. The use of subprocess to run potentially untrusted code constitutes a high risk. Hardcoded paths and URL further indicate potential malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior. No explicit data leaks or credential handling are observed, but the overall pattern of fetching and executing remote code is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior potential by cloning and executing code from an external source without validation, which can be used for malicious purposes. The behavior indicates high risk, and caution should be exercised before executing or trusting this code.",
