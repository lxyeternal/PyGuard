{
  "purpose": "The code extracts Roblox cookies from various browsers, validates them via Roblox API, retrieves user info, and exfiltrates data to a Discord webhook, indicating malicious credential theft and privacy invasion.",
  "sources": "Browser cookie storage locations (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) where cookies are read; external requests to Roblox API and IP service.",
  "sinks": "Discord webhook URL where sensitive data (cookies, user info, IP address) is posted; potentially other external endpoints if present.",
  "flows": "Cookies are collected from browsers (sources), validated via Roblox API, user info is gathered, then data (including cookies and user info) flows to the webhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad try-except blocks hiding errors; undefined variables (e.g., 'roblox_cookie', 'rolimons'); hardcoded webhook URL; inconsistent variable usage; code appears incomplete or obfuscated; multiple redundant appends of entire cookie lists.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically extracts Roblox cookies from multiple browsers, verifies their validity, retrieves user info, and exfiltrates this data to an external webhook. The presence of broad exception handling, undefined variables, and hardcoded URLs strongly suggest malicious intent. The code's obfuscation is moderate, primarily through variable naming, but not heavily encrypted. The core behavior aligns with credential harvesting and privacy invasion. The data flow from cookie extraction to external exfiltration confirms malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.8-1, risk: 0.8-1, obfuscation: 0.2-0.8) are justified; given the clear malicious intent, a malware score of 1.0 is appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a malicious credential stealer targeting Roblox users, designed to extract and exfiltrate sensitive cookies and user info without consent. It exhibits typical signs of malicious activity, including data exfiltration, use of obfuscation, and insecure practices. The high malware and security risk scores are justified and should be considered critical. The code warrants immediate review and removal due to its malicious nature.",
