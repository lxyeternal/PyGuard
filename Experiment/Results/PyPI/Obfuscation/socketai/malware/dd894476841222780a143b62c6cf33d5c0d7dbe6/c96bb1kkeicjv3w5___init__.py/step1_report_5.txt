{
  "purpose": "This script appears to retrieve Roblox user information and send it to a Discord webhook, possibly for malicious data collection or account tracking.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) for 'roblox.com'; IP address from ipify.org; user input through cookie validation; Roblox API endpoints for user info.",
  "sinks": "Requests to Discord webhook URL; Roblox API for user info; potential data leaks via webhook with user data and cookies; system commands executed with os.system.",
  "flows": "Cookie extraction from browsers -> Validation via Roblox API -> User info retrieval -> Data compiled into a message -> Sent to Discord webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple browser cookie access methods; sending Roblox cookie and user info directly to a Discord webhook; system commands with os.system; references to uninitialized variables (roblox_cookie, rid, rolimoons, roblox_profile, robux, crdate, rap, friends, age, ip_address) which are undefined in the code provided; heavily obfuscated variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code extracts cookies related to Roblox from various browsers, then validates the cookie by checking its validity via Roblox API. If valid, it retrieves user info such as UserID, username, Robux balance, premium status, creation date, and headshot. The script constructs a message with this info and posts it to a Discord webhook, potentially leaking sensitive data including cookies. The code contains several undefined variables and obfuscated names, indicating possible malicious intent. The system command execution and direct data transmission to external servers are suspicious, as they could be used to exfiltrate data or control the infected system.",
  "conclusion": "This script is designed to collect Roblox user data, including cookies, and send it to an external Discord webhook, indicating malicious behavior. It exploits browser cookies for credential harvesting and transmits sensitive information externally, which poses significant security and privacy risks.",
