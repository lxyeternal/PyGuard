  "purpose": "This script extracts Roblox cookies from browser storage, verifies their validity, retrieves user information from Roblox API, and sends this information to a Discord webhook. It appears to function as a Roblox user data grabber and notifier.",
  "sources": "Reads cookies from browser storage (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome), and retrieves external IP via 'https://api.ipify.org/'",
  "sinks": "Sends data to a Discord webhook URL, including potentially sensitive information such as Roblox cookies, user info, and IP address",
  "flows": "Cookie extraction from browser storage -> validation of cookie -> Roblox API calls to retrieve user info -> sending collected data to Discord webhook",
  "anomalies": "Uses broad try-except blocks without specific exception handling, potentially masking errors. Hardcoded Discord webhook URL and other variables. Concatenates URLs and data in an unsafe manner. The code appears to be designed for unauthorized data collection.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to retrieve Roblox cookies from various browser cookie storage locations, including Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, and Chrome. It then verifies the cookie's validity via Roblox API, retrieves user info such as UserID, UserName, Robux balance, and account details. The script constructs a message containing this data and posts it to a Discord webhook. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and cookie handling suggests malicious intent for unauthorized data harvesting. The code uses multiple try-except blocks broadly, which may hide runtime issues. The code's structure indicates it is intended for malicious data collection without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a malicious Roblox cookie stealer and information exfiltration tool. It collects sensitive user cookies and account info and sends them to an external Discord webhook. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL, cookie harvesting from browsers, and data exfiltration indicates malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and this code should not be used or trusted.",
