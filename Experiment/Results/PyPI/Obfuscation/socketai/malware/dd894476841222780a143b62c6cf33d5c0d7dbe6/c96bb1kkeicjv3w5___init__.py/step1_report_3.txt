  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to extract Roblox cookies from various browsers, validate the cookies, gather user info from Roblox, and send this data to a specified Discord webhook. It may also retrieve IP address information.",
  "sources": "Browser cookie storage (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) for '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie, user input via environment, external web requests to IP and Roblox APIs",
  "sinks": "Requests to Discord webhook URL with sensitive cookie data, external API calls revealing user information and IP address",
  "flows": "Cookie extraction from browser storage → Cookie validation → Roblox user info retrieval → Sending sensitive data to Discord webhook",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple browser cookie methods to locate '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie; attempts to send sensitive cookie data directly to a webhook; contains undefined variables (e.g., 'roblox_cookie', 'rolimons', 'roblox_profile', 'robux', 'crdate', 'rap', 'friends', 'age', 'ip_address') which suggests incomplete or obfuscated code; lack of error handling for failed requests; presence of hardcoded webhook URL; nonsensical variable naming and apparent code obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically retrieves Roblox security cookies from various browser profiles using the 'browser_cookie3' library. It then validates these cookies via Roblox's API. If validation fails, it posts an 'expired cookie' message to the Discord webhook, including the cookie. If successful, it fetches user information such as UserID, username, Robux balance, account age, and avatar. The code constructs URLs for user profile and external sites but does not utilize them meaningfully in the provided snippet. The code eventually posts a detailed message to a Discord webhook, including potentially sensitive user data and cookies. Several variables used in the webhook message are undefined or incomplete, indicating either obfuscation or incomplete code. The script demonstrates behavior consistent with credential theft and unauthorized data exfiltration, with potential for malicious use such as account hijacking or privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to extract and validate Roblox cookies from browser storage, gather user info, and exfiltrate sensitive data to a Discord webhook. It exhibits malicious intent, particularly with the harvesting and transmission of user credentials and personal data without user consent. The code's structure, variable naming, and handling suggest it is intended for malicious purposes rather than legitimate use.",
