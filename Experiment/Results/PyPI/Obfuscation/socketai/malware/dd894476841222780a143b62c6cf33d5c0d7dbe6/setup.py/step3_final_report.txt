  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, defining dependencies and version.",
  "sources": "The variable 'efNgQQifYSjVbtGQVXOQKbGBqoSAlyNd' (version string), package name 'c96bb1kkeicjv3w5', and dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The version variable flows into the setup call (though not explicitly used), and dependencies are declared for installation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name and package name, which are unusual and could be used to conceal intent but do not inherently indicate malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with obfuscated naming that raises suspicion but lacks any malicious code, network activity, or data handling. The dependencies are common libraries, and no runtime logic or external communications are present. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, though it warrants caution. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. The obfuscated score is moderate (~0.5), reflecting the naming pattern, and the security risk score is low (~0.2). Overall, the code appears benign, with obfuscation being the only suspicious aspect.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated variable and package names. No malicious or security-risk behavior is detected. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary based on the provided analysis.",
