  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'c96bb1kkeicjv3w5' with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings and package dependencies; no external or user input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; the code only declares setup parameters and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; setup configuration is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "The package name appears obfuscated or intentionally nonsensical, which could be suspicious. No version control or additional setup steps are present. No use of environment variables or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for packaging purposes and defines a version string with an obfuscated variable name. The setup() function specifies a package name that looks intentionally obscure or generated, and lists dependencies that include browser cookie handling, Discord webhook interaction, Roblox API, and HTTP requests. The code does not contain any input handling, data processing, or network communication beyond specifying dependencies. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. The obfuscated variable name and package name might indicate an attempt to hide intent, but there is no direct evidence of malicious activity.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard package setup with obfuscated naming that could raise suspicion but lacks any actual malicious or security-compromising behavior. The dependencies themselves are legitimate but could be used maliciously if misused. Overall, no malware or security risks are detected within this code snippet.",
