  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, executing an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup, which is characteristic of supply chain sabotage or backdoors. The high obfuscation, hidden execution, and silent error handling justify a high malware and risk score. The current assessments are accurate; the overall security risk should be considered very high, around 0.85."
