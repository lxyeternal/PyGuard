{
  "purpose": "The code appears to create a Python package that, during installation, writes a script that establishes a reverse remote access connection to a specific IP address, enabling remote command execution on the target machine.",
  "sources": "The code reads system and network information such as hostname, platform type, and attempts to connect to a hardcoded IP address; it also reads and writes files ('remote-access.py').",
  "sinks": "The code writes to a file ('remote-access.py') and executes it with subprocess, creating a remote shell access. It also reads the hostname and platform information and makes network connections to a fixed IP address.",
  "flows": "Source: Reading hostname, platform info, and writing 'remote-access.py'; Sink: Executing 'remote-access.py' which contains reverse shell code; Flow: The code writes a reverse shell script and then executes it, establishing remote control.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable names, dynamic code writing, hardcoded IP address (120.76.194.25), and auto-execution of a script that opens a reverse shell without user consent. The reverse shell code is embedded as a string and is designed to connect back to a remote server, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed as a Python package setup script with a custom install command. During installation, it creates a 'remote-access.py' script that contains reverse shell code capable of connecting back to a fixed IP address. The script uses threading and subprocess to spawn remote shells on Windows and Linux systems. After writing the malicious script, it attempts to move it to the user's Documents folder or home directory and then executes it. The embedded code (SaAKWkmeAUcWMOgiYpOSPXeHQthvKumt) is a reverse shell payload, establishing remote control over the compromised system. The presence of obfuscated variable names and hardcoded IP address strongly suggest malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to install a backdoor via reverse shell, enabling remote attackers to control the host machine. It automatically executes payloads that connect to a remote IP address, indicating high malicious intent with potential for system compromise.",
