      "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, acting as a backdoor via embedded reverse shell payloads executed during package installation. It employs obfuscation and hardcoded parameters to evade detection, posing a critical security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and security risk scores at 1, and obfuscation scores around 0.8. This package should be flagged as malware and removed from repositories to prevent system compromise."
