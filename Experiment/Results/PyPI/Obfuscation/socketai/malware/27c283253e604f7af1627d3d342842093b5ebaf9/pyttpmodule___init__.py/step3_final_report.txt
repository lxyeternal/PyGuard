{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a highly malicious info-stealer, collecting user credentials, tokens, cookies, wallet data, system info, decrypting stored data, and exfiltrating via webhooks and file uploads. It also terminates processes and employs obfuscation and threading to evade detection.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, local browser databases, wallet files, system files, user input, and network responses.",
  "sinks": "Requests to Discord webhooks, file uploads to external servers, process termination commands, and encrypted data decryption routines.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables, browser and wallet files → decryption routines → data assembly → exfiltration via webhooks and uploads; also includes process termination and threading for concurrent data collection.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic dependency installation, use of threading, process killing routines, hardcoded URLs, complex decryption routines, and encrypted data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code extensively targets user credentials, tokens, cookies, wallet info, and system data. It decrypts stored encrypted data, employs threading for parallel data collection, kills processes like browsers and wallets, and exfiltrates data via Discord webhooks and file uploads. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, and the code dynamically installs dependencies, indicating malicious intent and effort to evade detection. The routines for decryption, process termination, and data exfiltration are consistent with malware designed for stealthy data theft and system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, exhibiting comprehensive data theft, decryption routines, process manipulation, and exfiltration activities. It employs obfuscation and threading to maximize stealth and efficiency. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware score is at the maximum. The obfuscation score is also high due to variable name confusion and complex routines. The code should be classified as high-severity malware with near certainty of malicious intent.",
