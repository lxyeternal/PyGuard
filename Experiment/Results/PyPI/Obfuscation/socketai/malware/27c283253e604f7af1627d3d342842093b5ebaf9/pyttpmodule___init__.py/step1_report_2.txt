  "purpose": "The code appears to perform malicious activities such as stealing user credentials, cookies, browser data, and system information, then exfiltrating this data via webhook to a Discord server. It also interacts with system files, browser storage, and possibly decrypts sensitive data from browsers and wallet applications.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (e.g., 'LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA', 'TEMP'), system files (browser leveldb, wallet files, system logs), and network responses (IP geolocation, Discord API endpoints). It reads browser local storage, cookies, wallet data, and other system-specific files.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration occurs through webhook requests to Discord (requests with sensitive info like tokens, cookies, passwords, emails), and possibly through file uploads to external servers (via 'gofile.io'). It also interacts with system processes and kills tasks, which could be used maliciously.",
  "flows": "Sources such as system files, browser storage, and environment variables feed into decryption and data extraction routines, which then send the extracted data to remote servers via webhook or upload links. System info like IP, user info, and browser data flows into the data collection functions and is sent to external endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated variable names, dynamically installs packages, kills system processes, decrypts browser wallet data, and accesses various browser and wallet storage locations. It uses multiple threading for concurrent operations, decrypts sensitive data, and prepares detailed reports with user info, tokens, passwords, and cookies. It also interacts with system files and attempts to exfiltrate them.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by importing numerous modules, including some that are conditionally installed, suggesting an attempt to obscure dependencies. It performs network calls to obtain the system's public IP and geolocation data. It then defines multiple functions for decryption, data collection, and exfiltration via Discord webhooks. It actively kills certain processes, extracts browser cookies, local storage, and wallet data, decrypts encrypted keys, and searches for specific patterns in system logs and files. The code uses threading to parallelize tasks, collects tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data, and compiles reports with detailed user and system information. It ultimately sends all this data to Discord webhooks and uploads files to external servers, indicating malicious intent to exfiltrate user data stealthily. Variable names and obfuscated code constructs further suggest an attempt to hide malicious activities, making the overall purpose clearly malicious. The code also includes functions to interact with various browser profiles and wallets, indicating it targets multiple platforms and applications to maximize data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is malicious, designed to extract sensitive user information such as cookies, tokens, passwords, wallet data, and system info, then exfiltrate it via webhooks and file uploads. It employs obfuscation, process termination, and multi-threading to evade detection and maximize data theft. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the package should be considered dangerous and unsafe for use.",
