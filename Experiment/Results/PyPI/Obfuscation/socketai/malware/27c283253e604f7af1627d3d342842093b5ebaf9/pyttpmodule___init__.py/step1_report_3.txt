{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data collection and exfiltration, including gathering system info, cookies, passwords, tokens, and potentially sensitive data from browsers and applications, then reporting this information to a remote webhook or server.",
  "sources": "Inputs include environment variables, files from browser/user data directories, local database files, environment variables, and URL responses from external servers.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to external URLs via HTTP requests, including Discord webhooks, GoFile uploads, and other server endpoints. Files are created, manipulated, and uploaded, and subprocesses are invoked to kill processes and handle files.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (user/system data) flows into data collection routines, then to external servers via HTTP POST requests, file uploads, or process termination commands. Sensitive data from cookies, browser data, or local system info is collected and exfiltrated.",
  "anomalies": "Code dynamically installs dependencies without verification, collects cookies, passwords, browser info, and system info, then uploads data to external servers. Multiple functions manipulate system files, database files, and environment data, often in a way that suggests covert data collection. Use of threading, subprocesses, and direct process termination indicates malicious intent. The code also gathers potentially sensitive user info, including tokens, cookies, and local data. Obfuscated variable names and the use of dynamic process handling suggest malicious concealment. Also, code explicitly kills processes by name and archives system data.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed for stealthy data collection from user systems, including browser cookies, passwords, tokens, and local application data. It installs dependencies silently, uses threading to collect info concurrently, and uploads data to remote servers or webhooks. The collection functions target sensitive user data, system info, and application data, then transmit this data via HTTP requests or file uploads. It terminates specific processes and archives files for exfiltration. The use of obfuscated variables, dynamic process killing, and multiple data collection methods strongly indicate malicious behavior intended for unauthorized surveillance or theft of user information.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious intent, acting as a malware or info-stealer targeting user data, credentials, tokens, and system information. It stealthily installs dependencies, collects sensitive data from browsers and applications, and exfiltrates the information to external servers. It employs obfuscation techniques, process termination, and background threading to conceal its activities. Overall, this code is highly malicious and should be considered dangerous.",
