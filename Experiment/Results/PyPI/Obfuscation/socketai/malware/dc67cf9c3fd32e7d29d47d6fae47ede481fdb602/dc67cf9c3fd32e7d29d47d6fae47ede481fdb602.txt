      "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior indicative of malware, including stealthy, obfuscated PowerShell execution during setup. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and conditional trigger strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting caution and further analysis of the encoded command. The overall security risk is very high."
