  "purpose": "The script customizes the installation process of a Python package, executing system commands to collect system and network information, and then sends this data to a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads data from system commands ('uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist', 'whoami', 'hostname') and current working directory.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.system to send a formatted JSON payload containing collected data to a Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Sources (system commands and current directory) feed into the collection variables, which are then formatted into a JSON payload and sent via os.system call to a remote Slack URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects sensitive system information and transmits it to an external URL without user consent, which is suspicious. The use of dynamic system commands and environment data collection during package installation is unusual. The data transmission occurs automatically during setup, which is atypical for legitimate package behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the 'install' method. During installation, it executes system-specific commands to gather detailed system information, including OS details, network configuration, and process lists. It then constructs a JSON message containing the filename, hostname, user, IP address, current directory, OS info, and public IP, and sends this data via an HTTP POST request embedded in an os.system call to a Slack webhook URL. This behavior indicates the code is collecting and exfiltrating system data without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity or data theft. The usage of such data collection during package installation is highly suspicious and not typical for legitimate packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by automatically collecting sensitive system information and exfiltrating it to an external service during package setup. This behavior indicates potential data theft or surveillance, making this package unsafe to install or use.",
