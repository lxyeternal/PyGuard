{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system and environment information and send it to a remote Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Data is read from system commands via os.popen (uname, ifconfig, ipconfig, systeminfo, curl), and from environment variables (whoami, hostname).",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via an os.system call executing a curl command to a Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Collected system info flows from system commands to variables, then these variables are formatted into a JSON payload sent over the network via curl executed with os.system.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes obfuscated class and variable names. It performs system information collection without any user interaction or explicit consent. The data is directly sent to a remote server via a POST request embedded in a system call. Hardcoded webhook URL is embedded directly in the code, which could be malicious if the endpoint is malicious or unauthorized.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command class that, during installation, gathers system information depending on the platform (Linux, Windows, macOS). It retrieves OS details, network configuration, user info, hostname, and process list. It then constructs a JSON payload with this information and sends it via a curl command to a Slack webhook URL, which is hardcoded in the script. The obfuscated class name and variable names suggest an attempt to hide the malicious intent. The data collection and exfiltration happen automatically during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious, as it can be used for reconnaissance or unauthorized monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and exhibits malicious behavior by collecting detailed system information and exfiltrating it to a remote webhook during package installation. The obfuscated naming, direct network transmission, and automatic execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",
