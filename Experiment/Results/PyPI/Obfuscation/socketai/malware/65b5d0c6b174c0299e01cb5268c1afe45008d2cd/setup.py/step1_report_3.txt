  "purpose": "Custom setup script for Python package that collects system information during installation and sends it to a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "System commands executed via os.popen (uname, ifconfig, curl, systeminfo, ipconfig, tasklist, whoami, hostname). Data is retrieved from system commands and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a curl POST request to a Slack webhook with collected system info embedded in the payload.",
  "flows": "Data from system commands (sources) flows into the JSON payload in the os.system call, which then sends the data over the network to a remote Slack webhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of a custom class with obfuscated name, running system commands for gathering system info, and sending collected info over network during package installation. The data collection appears aggressive and potentially privacy-invasive. The use of hardcoded webhook URL (hidden in the code) is a security concern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during package installation, gathers detailed system information via platform-specific commands. It then constructs a JSON payload containing the filename, hostname, user, public IP, current directory, OS info, and IP configuration. This payload is sent to a Slack webhook URL using a system call with embedded data, which indicates data exfiltration. The use of obfuscated class name and the network transmission during setup are suspicious. The code does not appear to perform malicious actions beyond data collection and exfiltration, but these behaviors are privacy-invasive and could be exploited maliciously if the webhook URL is controlled by an attacker.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates potentially malicious behavior by collecting detailed system info and exfiltrating it during package installation without explicit user consent. The obfuscation and network activity indicate malicious intent or at least malicious capability, constituting a high security risk.",
