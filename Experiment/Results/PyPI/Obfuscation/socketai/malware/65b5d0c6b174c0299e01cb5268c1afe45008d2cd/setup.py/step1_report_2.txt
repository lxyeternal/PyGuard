  "purpose": "Customize installation process to gather system information and send it to a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "OS commands executed via os.popen() (uname, ifconfig, curl, systeminfo, ipconfig, tasklist, whoami, hostname)",
  "sinks": "os.system() call that sends data via curl POST request to Slack webhook URL",
  "flows": "Data from system commands flows into the JSON payload of the curl POST request, sending potentially sensitive info to an external server",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Slack webhook URL; extensive system information collection; execution of multiple OS-specific commands; no validation or sanitization of collected data",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during installation, executes various system commands based on platform. It collects OS details, hostname, username, IP info, and system info. It then formats this data into a JSON payload and sends it via a curl POST request to an external Slack webhook URL. The hardcoded webhook URL and collection of detailed system info suggest potential privacy violations. The code does not sanitize inputs or check for malicious intent but performs extensive data collection and external communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect detailed system information and transmit it to an external service without user consent, indicating malicious intent or privacy violation. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL and extensive system data collection raise high security concerns.",
