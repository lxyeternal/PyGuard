  "purpose": "Custom installation script that collects system information and posts it to a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "os.popen calls for system info, hostname, user, and IP; sys.platform for OS detection.",
  "sinks": "os.system call that sends collected data via curl POST request to external Slack webhook.",
  "flows": "Sources (os.popen outputs and sys.platform) are collected, stored in variables, then formatted into a JSON payload sent through os.system with curl to a remote URL.",
  "anomalies": "Code collects detailed system information including OS details, network info, and user info, then immediately posts this data to an external server during installation. Use of obfuscated class name and method name suggests attempts to hide behavior. No validation or encryption of data before transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that overrides the 'install' command from setuptools. During installation, it detects the platform and executes several system commands to gather environment, network, and system data. All data is concatenated into a JSON string and sent via a curl command to a specified Slack webhook URL. The code appears to be exfiltrating sensitive system info during package installation without user consent. The obfuscated class and method names, along with the data exfiltration, indicate malicious intent or at least highly suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs unauthorized collection and exfiltration of system information during package installation. Such behavior is typical of malicious or supply chain attack code. It does not have benign or legitimate reasons for sending detailed system info to an external webhook during a package install process.",
