{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information during package installation and exfiltrates it to an external Slack webhook, indicating malicious intent to spy or steal data without user consent.",
  "sources": "System commands such as 'uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'ipconfig', 'systeminfo', 'tasklist', 'whoami', 'hostname', and 'os.popen' calls to gather system info and user data.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' call executing a 'curl' command to POST collected data to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data is collected via system commands, stored in variables, formatted into a JSON payload, and then transmitted via 'curl' executed through 'os.system()' to the external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name and variable names, use of platform-specific commands, automatic data exfiltration during setup, hardcoded webhook URL, and collection of sensitive system info without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated custom 'install' class that, during package installation, executes platform-specific commands to gather system info, including hostname, user, IP addresses, OS details, and running processes. It then constructs a JSON payload with this info and sends it via a 'curl' POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL using 'os.system'. The obfuscation of class and variable names suggests an intent to hide malicious activity. The behavior is highly suspicious, as it exfiltrates sensitive data automatically during setup without user knowledge or consent. The code does not contain malicious payloads or exploits but performs privacy-invasive data collection and transmission, which classifies as malicious or at least highly suspicious. The high obfuscation and hardcoded URL further support malicious intent. The malware score is set to 1 due to the clear exfiltration activity, and the security risk score is also high, reflecting the privacy invasion and potential misuse.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting and exfiltrating sensitive system information during package installation, with obfuscation and hardcoded webhooks indicating malicious intent. It should be flagged as malware with high security risk. The activity aligns with supply chain attack patterns aimed at surveillance or data theft.",
