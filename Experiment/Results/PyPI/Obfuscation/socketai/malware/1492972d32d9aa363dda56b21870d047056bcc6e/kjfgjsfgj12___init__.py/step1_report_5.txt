  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident",
  "analysis": "This code only contains an import statement, which is a standard operation in Python to include modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code execution, or backdoors. The simplicity suggests it is a part of a larger codebase. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this minimal code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign import statement.",
