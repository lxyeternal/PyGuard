  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated scores:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement: `from . import main`.\n   - There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities based solely on this line.\n\n2. **Analysis of the Logical Reasoning and Conclusions:**\n   - Each report correctly states that the code is benign, minimal, and standard.\n   - The reasoning that no data flows, sinks, or anomalies are present is sound.\n   - The reports do not overreach; they acknowledge the limited context.\n\n3. **Score Justifications:**\n   - **Confidence:** Mostly 1, with one at 0.9, which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n   - **Obfuscated:** All 0, which is correct.\n   - **Malware:** All 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - **Security Risk:** All 0 or very close to it (0.1 in one report), which is appropriate given the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Overestimations:**\n   - No report suggests any suspicious behavior, external data handling, or malicious intent.\n   - The minimal code snippet does not warrant any higher risk or malware scores.\n\n5. **Scores Higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign scores above 0.5 for malware or security risk, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Final Assessment:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The scores align well with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Overall, my estimated scores for this code snippet are:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that this is a benign, standard import statement with no security concerns.",
