  "purpose": "Import the 'main' module from the current package, likely for executing or accessing core functionality.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads are evident in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network connections, or sensitive operations are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only performs an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident. The import statement is straightforward and typical for Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement importing 'main' from the current package. There are no inputs, outputs, network operations, or data handling. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. This is a standard import statement commonly used in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple relative import with no malicious intent or security concerns evident. It appears to be a routine part of a larger codebase, and there are no signals of malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet.",
