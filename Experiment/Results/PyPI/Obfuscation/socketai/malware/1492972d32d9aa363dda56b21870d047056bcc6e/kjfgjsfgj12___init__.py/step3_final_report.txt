{
  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of the 'main' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is the source; no external data or input is read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present; the import simply includes a module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement. It does not execute code beyond module inclusion, does not handle data, and does not perform network operations. The minimal nature of the code and lack of suspicious patterns indicate no malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports reflect this, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores at zero or near-zero. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a standard import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
