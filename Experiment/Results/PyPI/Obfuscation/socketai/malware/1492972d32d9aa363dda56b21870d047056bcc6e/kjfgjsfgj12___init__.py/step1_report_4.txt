  "purpose": "Importing the 'main' module from the current package.",
  "sources": "The code imports a module named 'main' from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single import statement from the current package, which is standard in Python for modular organization. There are no visible signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code execution. Since this is a very limited snippet, there is no evidence of data leakage, injection, or obfuscated code. No external or untrusted data sources are involved, nor are there any sinks where data might be leaked or misused.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this minimal snippet, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and standard for Python module structure.",
