{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to execute obfuscated/complex functions, likely malicious, despite a print statement.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated lambda functions, globals, and code execution points.",
  "sinks": "eval, globals, exec, dynamic import, potentially malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "From obfuscated lambda functions and globals to eval/exec and dynamic import.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, string encoding, complex lambda functions, dynamic module import, and code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code employs complex, obfuscated functions, dynamic import, eval, exec, and string decoding, all typical of malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "High suspicion of malicious intent, high confidence (0.95), obfuscated (0.9), malware (1), risk (1). The code is heavily obfuscated, employs dynamic code execution, and uses encoded strings to conceal malicious payloads. It should be treated as a high-severity security threat.",
