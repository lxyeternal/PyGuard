{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, with an embedded potentially malicious PowerShell command that executes upon installation.",
  "sources": "Reading file existence with os.path.exists, importing subprocess and os modules, and executing a subprocess command with PowerShell encoded command.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executes the PowerShell encoded command, which is likely used to run malicious payload silently.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code triggers subprocess.Popen with an encoded PowerShell command, executing outside normal setup procedures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64, running during setup without user consent; silent execution via CREATE_NO_WINDOW; lack of any visible logging or user notification.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a setup for a Python package but includes a suspicious block that checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg'. If absent, it executes a subprocess with a PowerShell encoded command, likely for malicious purposes. The subprocess is configured to run hidden, avoiding user detection. The setup call itself is standard and benign, but the embedded command raises suspicion. The try-except blocks suppress errors silently, further obscuring malicious activity. Overall, the code appears designed to execute hidden, potentially malicious code during package installation, constituting a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload executed via PowerShell during package setup, likely for malicious purposes such as persistence, data collection, or remote control. The rest of the script appears standard. It should not be used in production without thorough investigation and removal of the payload.",
