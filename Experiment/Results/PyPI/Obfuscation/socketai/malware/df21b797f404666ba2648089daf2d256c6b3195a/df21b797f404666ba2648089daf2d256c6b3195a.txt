      "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior indicative of malicious activity, including stealthy execution of an encoded PowerShell command during setup. The obfuscation, silent execution, and lack of transparency justify high malware and risk scores. The pattern aligns with common malware tactics, warranting caution and further investigation."
