{
  "purpose": "The code performs system reconnaissance and exfiltrates system information to an external server during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Hostname, current working directory, username, IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6), directory listings from specified root directories.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to 'https://425a2.rt11.ml' transmitting collected data in JSON format.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system info functions, encoded in hex, assembled into a hostname, DNS resolution occurs, then data flows via HTTP POST to external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with variable names and string encoding, dynamic hostname construction, DNS resolution of constructed hostname, network activity during setup, use of suspicious external URL.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the install command to execute during package setup, collecting system info and directory listings, encoding data, constructing a hostname, performing DNS resolution, and sending data via HTTP POST to an external server. Obfuscated variable names and hex encoding are used to conceal malicious intent. The external URL and data exfiltration are outside normal setup scope, indicating malicious activity. The behavior aligns with data theft or device fingerprinting tactics. The high scores assigned in the reports (around 0.8-0.9 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk) are justified given the covert data collection and exfiltration behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior through covert data collection, obfuscation, and external exfiltration during package installation. The high scores across reports are justified and reflect a high-security threat. It should be flagged as malware and avoided.",
