{
  "purpose": "The code provides a comment describing the functionality of the 'requests.certs' module, specifically about returning the default CA certificate bundle.",
  "sources": "No actual data reading sources present in executable code; only a descriptive comment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths as there is no executable logic, only comments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a code-like reference 'requests.certs' without actual implementation; comment appears incomplete or out of context. The line 'requests.certs' could be mistaken for code but is likely just a header or annotation.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet is a comment describing the behavior of the 'requests.certs' module, stating that it returns the default CA bundle from 'certifi'. There is no executable code, no data handling, and no logic implemented. The mention of changing 'where()' suggests configurability but provides no actual code to analyze for malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain executable logic or data handling, only a descriptive comment. It appears to be documentation or a header snippet rather than active code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
