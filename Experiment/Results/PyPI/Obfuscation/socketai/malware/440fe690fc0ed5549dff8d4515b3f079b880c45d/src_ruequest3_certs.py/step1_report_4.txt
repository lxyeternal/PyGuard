{
  "purpose": "The code appears to describe a module related to obtaining the default CA certificate bundle used by the requests library.",
  "sources": "No actual data input or external data reading occurs in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink functions or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code does not process or transfer data from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an incomplete line 'requests.certs' and a fragmented comment. The line 'requests.certs' does not perform any operation and appears to be an orphaned reference. The comment mentions changing 'where()' but no such function is defined or invoked.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal and appears to be a fragment of documentation or an incomplete module. It references the 'requests' library and its certificate handling but lacks executable statements or logic. The only notable feature is an orphaned attribute 'requests.certs' which does not impact execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations. The comment suggests customization of CA bundle location, a normal practice in packaging but provides no malicious intent or actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign and likely part of documentation or a stub. It contains no executable code or malicious behavior. Its structure is incomplete, with no active functions or data flows indicating any security risk.",
