  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a complex, heavily obfuscated HTTP client library. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network backdoors, or malicious payloads. The high obfuscation warrants further dynamic or runtime analysis before deployment, but static review alone does not confirm malware. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified based on the static code analysis."
