  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, hardcoded URLs/IPs, dynamic eval/exec calls, obfuscated variables, control flow structures, input/output operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, data leaks, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as hardcoded addresses or eval calls leading to suspicious network activity or code execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded network addresses, complex control flow, lack of documentation.",
  "analysis": "The reports are generally consistent in their scoring. Report 3 exhibits multiple red flags—dynamic eval/exec, obfuscated variables, suspicious network addresses—justifying high malware (0.75), obfuscation (0.8), and security risk (0.8) scores with high confidence (0.85). Reports 1, 2, and 5 show minimal or benign code, correctly scored with zero or low suspicion. Report 4 shows obfuscation and potential dynamic execution but lacks concrete malicious indicators, resulting in moderate scores (malware 0.2, obfuscated 0.8, risk 0.4). The scoring aligns with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code reviews and scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. Report 3 warrants high suspicion, while others are benign or mildly suspicious. Overall, the assessments are accurate, and no further modifications are needed.",
