  "conclusion": "The setup script exhibits heavy obfuscation, embedded binary payloads, and runtime code execution that are characteristic of malicious or compromised software. The use of __pyarmor__ and dynamic execution methods suggest an attempt to conceal malicious payloads or enforce licensing in a way that could be exploited. The suspicious system commands and obfuscated code warrant caution. While definitive malicious activity cannot be confirmed without further payload analysis, the evidence points to a high security risk. Deployment or trust in this package should be avoided until thorough static and dynamic analysis confirms safety."
