{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated exception class definitions with static string attributes, no active malicious behavior or data flows observed.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'urllib3.exceptions' and local compat module; class attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, external data handling, or network interactions detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; static class attributes with no dynamic data processing.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation in class names and attribute values; use of meaningless strings and inheritance from standard exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with obfuscated names and static string attributes, inheriting from standard or third-party exceptions. No evidence of data input, external communication, or malicious code execution. The obfuscation appears to be a stylistic or concealment measure rather than an indicator of malicious intent. Static analysis supports a benign assessment, with no active malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated exception classes with no active malicious features. Static analysis indicates minimal security risk, but obfuscation warrants cautious review. Malware score is set to 0, obfuscated score remains high (~0.7), and overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
