  "purpose": "Compatibility functions for http.cookiejar.CookieJar with requests, managing cookie headers and policies.",
  "sources": "Headers, CookieJar objects, request parameters, environment variables, input data for cookies.",
  "sinks": "Cookie headers in requests, CookieJar modifications, header extraction, cookie setting/removal.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into CookieJar and headers; headers and cookies are extracted or set based on input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable and function names, placeholder-like comments, inconsistent formatting, suspicious comments.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a compatibility layer for cookie management, involving standard cookie operations. The heavy obfuscation and placeholder text are suspicious but do not directly indicate malicious activity. No network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications are evident. The obfuscation could be an attempt to conceal malicious intent or sabotage, but from static analysis alone, no malicious commands are visible. The code appears to be a utility for cookie handling with obfuscation as the main red flag.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely a heavily obfuscated compatibility utility for cookie management. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscation warrants caution. Scores should reflect moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation, but not outright malware.",
