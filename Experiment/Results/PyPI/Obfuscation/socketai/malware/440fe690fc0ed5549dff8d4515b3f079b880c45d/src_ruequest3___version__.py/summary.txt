  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are justified and appropriate. Minor adjustments could lower the risk score to 0.1 for increased accuracy, but given the evidence, the existing low risk level remains valid."
