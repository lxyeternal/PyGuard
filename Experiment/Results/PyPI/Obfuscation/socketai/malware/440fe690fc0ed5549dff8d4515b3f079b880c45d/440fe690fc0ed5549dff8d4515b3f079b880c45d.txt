      "conclusion": "The setup script exhibits heavy obfuscation, embedded binary payloads, and runtime code execution that are characteristic of malicious or compromised software. The use of __pyarmor__ and dynamic execution methods suggest an attempt to conceal malicious payloads or enforce licensing in a way that could be exploited. The suspicious system commands and obfuscated code warrant caution. While definitive malicious activity cannot be confirmed without further payload analysis, the evidence points to a high security risk. Deployment or trust in this package should be avoided until thorough static and dynamic analysis confirms safety."

While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network backdoors, or malicious payloads. The high obfuscation warrants further dynamic or runtime analysis before deployment, but static review alone does not confirm malware. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified based on the static code analysis."

The high security risk score in Report 1 should be lowered. Obfuscation scores in reports 2 and 3 could be increased slightly to reflect suspicion, but malware scores should remain at zero. Overall, the dependency appears safe with minor obfuscation concerns."

Minor adjustments could lower the risk score to 0.1 for increased accuracy, but given the evidence, the existing low risk level remains valid."
