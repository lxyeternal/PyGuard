  "purpose": "Describe the usage and features of the Python 'requests' HTTP library for making GET and POST requests.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data from network responses, variables, and parameters in functions.",
  "sinks": "Network request functions ('requests.get', 'requests.post'), potentially exposing untrusted data over the network or handling user input.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., URLs, payloads) flow into 'requests' methods, and responses are processed or outputted, but no direct malicious flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual placeholder variable names such as 'r.DYCOnyRYHbDCjPoaDGCgUbuOwGElwJjL' and 'r.UXwUKpxKmMEXwnKEldiPumoBvFHneTTb' which appear as obfuscated or nonsensical. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code snippets seem intentionally obscured or corrupted, possibly to hide actual logic.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a documentation or example snippet describing the usage of the 'requests' library. It includes example GET and POST requests with typical parameters. The presence of strange, nonsensical variable names suggests potential obfuscation or placeholder content. No actual malicious logic, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors, is present in the provided snippet. The code does not perform any harmful operations beyond standard HTTP requests. The unusual variable names might imply obfuscation or corruption but do not constitute malicious intent per se.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily serves as documentation or sample usage for the 'requests' library. It contains no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The anomalous variable names are suspicious but do not appear to be malicious in this context. Overall, the code is safe based on the provided snippet.",
