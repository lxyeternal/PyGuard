  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Embedded code snippets, comments, variable names, and placeholder strings within the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or malicious actions if untrusted data is processed or network connections are misused; primarily theoretical as no active code is present.",
  "flows": "Code snippets show data flow from input (comments/examples) to output (responses), but no actual runtime flows are demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder or nonsensical strings, heavily obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'r.DYCOnyRYHbDCjPoaDGCgUbuOwGElwJjL'), and inconsistent naming conventions suggest obfuscation or placeholder content.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of documentation and illustrative examples with embedded placeholder strings and obfuscated variable names. No active malicious code, payloads, or network exfiltration are evident. The obfuscation appears as placeholder or formatting artifacts rather than malicious obfuscation. The high risk score in Report 1 is unjustified given the benign nature of the content. The embedded nonsensical strings and obfuscated variable names in other reports suggest potential obfuscation but do not demonstrate malicious intent. Malware scores are correctly set to zero across all reports. Obfuscation scores are higher where placeholder strings are present, justified by the suspicion of obfuscation artifacts. Overall, the code is safe but warrants cautious monitoring due to obfuscation signs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign documentation with some obfuscation artifacts. No active malware or malicious behavior is detected. The high security risk score in Report 1 should be lowered. Obfuscation scores in reports 2 and 3 could be increased slightly to reflect suspicion, but malware scores should remain at zero. Overall, the dependency appears safe with minor obfuscation concerns.",
