  "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign documentation with some obfuscation artifacts. No active malware or malicious behavior is detected. The high security risk score in Report 1 should be lowered. Obfuscation scores in reports 2 and 3 could be increased slightly to reflect suspicion, but malware scores should remain at zero. Overall, the dependency appears safe with minor obfuscation concerns."
