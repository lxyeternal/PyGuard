{
  "purpose": "To provide an overview and usage examples of the Python 'requests' library for making HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'import requests', usage of 'requests.get', 'requests.post', and access to response attributes",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if untrusted data is handled insecurely, such as printing response content or using unvalidated input in requests",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., URLs, payloads) from user or external sources flows into 'requests' methods, which generate HTTP requests and responses; response data is accessed via response attributes",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected; obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are absent",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward documentation and example usage of the 'requests' library, demonstrating GET and POST requests with sample code snippets. No dynamic or untrusted input processing is shown, nor any code executing external commands, handling secrets, or performing insecure operations. The library usage appears standard, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The code is purely illustrative and references external documentation for full details.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example and documentation for the 'requests' library, with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and standard usage of the library.",
