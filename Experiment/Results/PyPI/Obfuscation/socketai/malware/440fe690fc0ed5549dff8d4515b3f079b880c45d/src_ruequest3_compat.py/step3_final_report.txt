  "purpose": "Environment setup and compatibility detection through conditional imports and version checks.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements, variable assignments, version info checks",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no data exfiltration or malicious network activity present",
  "flows": "Version info variables influence conditional import logic; obfuscated variables used throughout",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, redefinition of built-in types (str, bytes), conditional imports based on environment",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection, conditional imports (e.g., chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json), and defines data types. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, likely for concealment or protection. No network activity, data handling, or malicious functions are present. The obfuscation is notable but not inherently malicious. The code appears to be a compatibility or setup routine typical in larger libraries. Scores assigned in previous reports (malware: near zero, obfuscation high, low risk) are consistent with the benign nature of this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign environment setup routine with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware scores should remain at 0 given the lack of malicious activity. Overall, the code is safe and typical for compatibility layers.",
