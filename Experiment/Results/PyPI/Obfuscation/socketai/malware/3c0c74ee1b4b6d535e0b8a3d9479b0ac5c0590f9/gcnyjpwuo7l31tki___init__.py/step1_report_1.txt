  "flows": "No data flows, input-to-output or otherwise, are present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is empty with no content, functions, or logic; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment is empty, containing no executable statements, functions, or data handling. As a result, there are no apparent sources, sinks, or data flows. The lack of content means there are no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code present. The structure and format do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the complete absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be an empty placeholder with no functionality or security concerns.",
