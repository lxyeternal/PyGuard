  "sources": "No identifiable sources of input or data are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or points where untrusted data could cause harm are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows because the code contains no logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is empty, contains no functions, variables, or operations, which is unusual for functional code but not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is empty, with no executable statements, no imports, and no data handling mechanisms. This could indicate a placeholder file or incomplete code, but no malicious or suspicious behavior is detectable. Without additional code, there are no security concerns, no hardcoded credentials, and no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an empty or placeholder file with no malicious content or security risks. Due to lack of actual logic or data processing, there are no signs of malware, anomalies, or security threats.",
