  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 2 shows suspicious patterns warranting higher scores, but no confirmed malicious activity is present. Slight score adjustments improve accuracy. The overall security posture remains low risk, with cautious monitoring recommended for suspicious patterns."
