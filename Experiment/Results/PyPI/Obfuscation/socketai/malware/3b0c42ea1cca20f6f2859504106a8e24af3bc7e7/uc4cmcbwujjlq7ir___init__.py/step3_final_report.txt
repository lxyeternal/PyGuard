  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Imports, environment variables, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), control flow structures, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) to sinks (network, file, eval/exec) via control flow and data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious dynamic execution, obfuscation hints, complex control flow, environment manipulation, minimal or no code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets generally show benign, straightforward scripts with no suspicious activity. Report 2 exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution hints, raising suspicion but lacking concrete malicious payloads. Reports 1, 3, 4, and 5 are consistent with benign code. The scores reflect these observations, with some reports potentially underestimating suspicion in Report 2. Adjustments suggest increasing malware and obfuscation scores for Report 2 to better match the suspicious features. Overall, the assessments are aligned with the evidence, indicating low to moderate risk, with the highest concern in Report 2.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 2 shows suspicious patterns warranting higher scores, but no confirmed malicious activity is present. Slight score adjustments improve accuracy. The overall security posture remains low risk, with cautious monitoring recommended for suspicious patterns.",
