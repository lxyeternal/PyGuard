{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python module or script, potentially for general utility or application logic. No specific malicious intent or unusual functionality is immediately evident.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly from external modules or network requests if present.",
  "sinks": "Data is potentially sent over network connections, written to files, or used in system calls or database queries. Specific sink points are not explicitly detailed in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions or environment variables through internal processing and possibly towards network sockets, files, or other output functions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no evident anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution. The code structure appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code shows standard usage of Python constructs, third-party libraries, and common patterns. No indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The absence of suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or anomalous code flow supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the detailed review, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a typical, benign Python script or module. However, without additional context or runtime behavior, the confidence level remains high but not absolute.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
