  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, embedding a reverse shell and backdoor mechanism during package setup. It reads system info, connects to an external server, redirects I/O, and spawns a shell, enabling remote control. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. All reports correctly identify these behaviors, and the overall assessment confirms a severe security threat."
