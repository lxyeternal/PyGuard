{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to execute during package setup, reading process info from /proc, establishing a network connection to a remote IP, redirecting I/O streams, and spawning a shell, effectively creating a reverse shell backdoor.",
  "sources": "Reads /proc/{pid}/cmdline, /proc/{pid}/status, /proc/{pid}/stat, /proc/{pid}/statm files; uses socket connection to remote IP; environment variable modification; invocation during setup commands.",
  "sinks": "Network socket connection to remote IP; spawning a shell via pty.spawn; redirecting stdin, stdout, stderr to socket; setting environment variables.",
  "flows": "Reads process info from /proc files -> connects to remote IP -> redirects I/O streams to socket -> spawns shell -> allows remote command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and class names; code executes during package setup; hardcoded remote IP and port; spawning a shell during installation; reading sensitive process info.",
  "analysis": "The code performs malicious activities including establishing a reverse shell, reading process information, and executing during package installation, which are classic indicators of a supply chain backdoor. The obfuscation and embedded network activity strongly suggest malicious intent. The code's behavior is consistent across reports, with all identifying the reverse shell, remote control, and obfuscation. The connection to a specific external IP during setup is a significant security concern. The code does not contain benign logic, and the malicious indicators are clear and deliberate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, embedding a reverse shell and backdoor mechanism during package setup. It reads system info, connects to an external server, redirects I/O, and spawns a shell, enabling remote control. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. All reports correctly identify these behaviors, and the overall assessment confirms a severe security threat.",
