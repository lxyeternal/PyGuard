{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for package setup and installation, but it also includes functionality to gather process information and establish a reverse shell connection to a specified IP address.",
  "sources": "Reading process files in /proc filesystem; socket connection to external IP; environment variable modification; spawning a shell process.",
  "sinks": "socket connection to external server; spawning a shell process; environment variable modification; writing to a file.",
  "flows": "Process info reading functions feed data into file writes; socket connection initiated and used to spawn a shell; environment variable is set before spawning a shell.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code structure with obfuscated function and variable names; use of /proc filesystem info reading (commonly used for reconnaissance); attempt to open a socket and spawn a shell, which indicates potential remote access or control; no comments or documentation explaining intent; presence of code that triggers a reverse shell during setup phase.",
  "analysis": "The code defines obfuscated functions and variables that read process information from /proc, which could be reconnaissance or data collection. The function jAxZxNMDdKcMmmxsMSQwTaCaIKTLduTx() connects to a hardcoded IP address (3.228.3.164) on port 80, writes process info to a file, then attempts to spawn a bash shell via pty.spawn, redirecting I/O streams through the socket. This behavior is typical of a reverse shell or remote code execution. The class inheritance from egg_info and install indicates this code runs during package setup, which could be malicious if integrated into a package distributed publicly. The code does not contain obvious hardcoded credentials but does perform suspicious network and shell operations. The obfuscation, combined with network and shell activity in a setup context, suggests malicious intent to establish remote access or control.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior: it attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a specific IP during package installation, reading process info and redirecting I/O streams through the socket. This indicates it is likely a malicious backdoor embedded within a package. The obfuscation and unusual behavior significantly increase the risk profile.",
