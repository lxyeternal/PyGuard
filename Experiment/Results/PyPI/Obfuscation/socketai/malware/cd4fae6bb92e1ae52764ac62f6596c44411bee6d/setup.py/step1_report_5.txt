{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package and includes functions that gather process information and attempt to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading process info files in /proc (e.g., /proc/{pid}/cmdline, /proc/{pid}/status, etc.), socket connection to a hardcoded IP, environment variable manipulation, and spawning a shell.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to remote IP (potential data exfiltration), spawning a shell (potential remote code execution), environment variable modification, file writing of process info.",
  "flows": "Process info files are read and saved locally; socket connection is established to a fixed IP; upon connection, the code duplicates socket to stdin, stdout, stderr, modifies environment, then spawns a shell, potentially allowing remote command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP address, function names are obfuscated, code attempts to spawn a shell connected to a remote server, reads and writes process info, includes classes that override setup commands, which may execute malicious code during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary behavior involves collecting process information from /proc, then attempting to connect back to a specific IP address (3.228.3.164) on port 80. Once connected, it redirects the shell's standard streams to this network socket and spawns a bash shell, which is a common pattern for establishing a reverse shell. This behavior is highly suspicious, especially given the hardcoded IP and the use of socket and pty modules to facilitate remote command execution. The code also overwrites setup commands to execute this reverse shell during installation, indicating potential sabotage of the package. Overall, the code is designed for malicious remote control, representing a severe security threat.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code that, if installed, would attempt to establish a reverse shell to a hardcoded remote server, providing remote control over the host machine. The presence of obfuscated function names, reverse shell logic, and environment modifications confirms malicious intent. The code is a security risk and should not be used.",
