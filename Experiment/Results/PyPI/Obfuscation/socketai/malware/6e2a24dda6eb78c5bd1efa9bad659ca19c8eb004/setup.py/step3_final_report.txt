  "purpose": "Build configuration script for a Python package involving CFFI and libffi, with platform-specific setup and environment detection.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PKG_CONFIG, CFFI_FORCE_STATIC), filesystem checks, subprocess calls, system platform detection.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess executions, environment variable reads, filesystem access, system configuration modifications.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence subprocess commands and configuration; platform detection guides setup; subprocess outputs influence configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'cmsntkrcwvoqatf5' appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual but not malicious; use of os.popen for 'brew' detection is outdated but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build setup tasks for a Python C extension, with environment-aware configuration and platform-specific logic. No malicious code, backdoors, or network activity are present. The only suspicious aspect is the package name, which appears obfuscated but does not indicate malicious intent. The use of environment variables and subprocess calls aligns with typical build scripts. No signs of obfuscation techniques or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build configuration for a Python extension involving CFFI and libffi. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The only point of concern is the package name, which appears obfuscated but not malicious. The overall security risk is low.",
