  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly identifies as a setup script for building a Python package with CFFI and libffi.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess, environment variables, and filesystem access in standard ways for build scripts.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no malicious code, and no suspicious network activity. The logic is consistent with typical build scripts.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe, and standard.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (reasonable given the environment-dependent complexity but no malicious intent)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on environment variables and subprocesses.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Notes potential manipulation via environment variables and filesystem, but no actual malicious activity. Use of os.popen and environment checks are typical.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard build script, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (appropriate, considering the potential for environment manipulation but no active maliciousness)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general purpose, with focus on cross-platform build configuration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The package name 'cmsntkrcwvoqatf5' appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual. However, the code logic remains typical for build scripts.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious code, just an odd package name. No evidence of malware.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2 (justified due to the suspicious package name)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (reasonable)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build configuration with environment and system detection.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The use of environment variables like 'CFFI_FORCE_STATIC' and dynamic configuration could be manipulated, but no malicious intent is evident. The package name again looks suspicious but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical build script, no malware.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (acceptable, considering environment manipulation potential)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard build configuration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; detailed environment handling is typical.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build script.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (appropriate, minimal risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Slightly elevated in reports 3 and 4 due to the package name but not indicative of actual obfuscation techniques.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low, reflecting the standard nature of build scripts, with slight increases due to environment variable manipulations and unusual package names.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.2 (due to suspicious package name in some reports)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (standard build script risks, environment manipulation potential)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The code is a typical, environment-aware build configuration script for a Python package involving C extensions. No malicious or obfuscated code is present beyond superficial package name oddities. The overall security risk remains low.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed to the scores. The code is safe, and the reports are justified.",
