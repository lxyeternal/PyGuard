{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to handle C foreign function interface (FFI) type resolution, particularly for Windows platform-specific types, using the cffi library.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, local modules (model, error), optional _cffi_backend module, and dynamic type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Type resolution functions that process type strings and cache results; potential for injecting malicious data if external input influences 'commontype'.",
  "flows": "Type string input (commontype) -> resolve_common_type function -> parsing or retrieval from cache -> return type object.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except blocks for dynamic import, conditional updates to COMMON_TYPES based on platform, no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. The code appears standard for FFI type handling.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a type mapping dictionary, attempts to load platform-specific or backend-specific types, and defines functions to resolve types with caching. It handles special cases for Windows-specific types. No evidence of malicious code, such as network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration. The code relies on standard libraries and local modules. The type resolution and platform-specific updates are typical for such interface code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for managing CFFI types with platform-specific adjustments. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
