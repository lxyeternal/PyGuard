  "purpose": "Manage CFFI types with platform-specific adjustments, caching, and type resolution functions.",
  "sources": "Type definitions, platform detection, internal parser and model modules",
  "sinks": "Internal cache, type resolution functions, no external data sinks",
  "flows": "resolve_common_type calls parser.parse_type_and_quals with cdecl; caches results",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'set-unicode-needed' as a placeholder for deferred types; no suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility for managing CFFI types across platforms, with conditional platform-specific type definitions, caching, and exception handling. It does not perform network activity, file I/O beyond type definitions, or execute external commands. The placeholders are typical for deferred type resolution. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code's logic is straightforward and aligns with common practices in FFI type management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for CFFI type handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The use of placeholders and dynamic imports are standard patterns, not indicators of malicious intent.",
