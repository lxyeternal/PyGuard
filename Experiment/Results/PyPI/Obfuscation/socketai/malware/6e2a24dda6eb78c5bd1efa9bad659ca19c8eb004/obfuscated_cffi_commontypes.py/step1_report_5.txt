  "purpose": "This code defines and manages common types for CFFI (C Foreign Function Interface) usage, primarily focusing on type resolution and platform-specific type definitions for Windows.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (sys, model, FFIError), attempts to import _cffi_backend, reads from COMMON_TYPES dictionary, and uses sys.platform to determine platform-specific types.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data output points related to untrusted input; type definitions and type resolution logic do not process external untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code initializes COMMON_TYPES, attempts to populate it from an internal CFFI backend, then resolves types via resolve_common_type, and updates platform-specific types if on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The use of try-except for optional import is standard. No obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script manages type definitions and resolution for a CFFI interface, including platform-specific handling. It attempts to import internal backend functions, falls back gracefully if unavailable, and raises errors on unsupported types. The code is well-structured with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The logic is straightforward and consistent with type management tasks. No external data input or output is processed in a way that suggests malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign type management module for CFFI, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs standard type resolution and platform-specific type definitions without any malicious intent.",
