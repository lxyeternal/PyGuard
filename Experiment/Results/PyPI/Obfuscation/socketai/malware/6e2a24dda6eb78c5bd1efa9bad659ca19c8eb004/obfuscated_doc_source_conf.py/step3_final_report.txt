  "purpose": "This code is a static configuration script for Sphinx documentation, setting various project and output parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from static variable assignments; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' and 'os' modules but does not utilize them, serving only as static configuration. It sets project metadata and output options without any dynamic or external data handling. No suspicious patterns, code injection, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and standard for Sphinx documentation setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
