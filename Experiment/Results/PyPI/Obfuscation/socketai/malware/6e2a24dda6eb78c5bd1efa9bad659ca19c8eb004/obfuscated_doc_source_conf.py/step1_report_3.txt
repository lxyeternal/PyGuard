  "purpose": "This code configures documentation build settings for a Python project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'sys' and 'os' modules but does not invoke any functions or methods that process untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that handle untrusted data; no external communications, file writes, or data leaks are performed.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines static configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed. The imports are standard, and no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward static configuration for Sphinx documentation. It imports standard modules but does not utilize them beyond the import statement. No input handling, no external communications, nor any code that could be malicious. The variables are typical for Sphinx configuration files, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code insertion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script for documentation purposes. There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present.",
