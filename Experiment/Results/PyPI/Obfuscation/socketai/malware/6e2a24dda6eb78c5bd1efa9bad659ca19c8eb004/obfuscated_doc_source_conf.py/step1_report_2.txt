  "purpose": "The code is a configuration script for setting up documentation generation using Sphinx for the project named 'CFFI'.",
  "sources": "The script reads static configuration data, including project info, file paths, and extension lists.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks involving untrusted data or external outputs in this code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules, defining configuration variables, and setting up documentation parameters without any data processing or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code, are present.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward static configuration file for Sphinx documentation. It imports standard modules, sets static configuration variables, and defines documentation parameters. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are involved. The code does not contain any suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The structure and content are typical of Sphinx conf.py files, indicating a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
