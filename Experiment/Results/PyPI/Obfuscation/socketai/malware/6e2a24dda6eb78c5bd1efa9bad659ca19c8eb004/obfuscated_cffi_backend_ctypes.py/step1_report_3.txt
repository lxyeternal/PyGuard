  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a utility script possibly related to network or data processing, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, possibly reads files or network data if present (not explicitly shown), but no clear data sources are visible in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data processing functions. However, without explicit code snippets, specific sink points cannot be identified.",
  "flows": "Without concrete code, flow analysis cannot be precisely determined. Typically, untrusted data would flow from sources to sinks if malicious intent exists.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are detected. Lack of explicit malicious patterns or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of visible code in the provided input, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. If code were provided, I would examine for suspicious patterns, insecure data handling, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, there is no evident malicious behavior or security risk. The code appears benign, but the lack of specific content limits confidence. Please provide the actual code snippet for a thorough review.",
