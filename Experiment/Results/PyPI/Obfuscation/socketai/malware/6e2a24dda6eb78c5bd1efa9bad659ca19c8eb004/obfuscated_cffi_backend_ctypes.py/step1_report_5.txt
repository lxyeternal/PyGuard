{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing and possibly network communication, but without explicit context, the exact purpose cannot be fully determined.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, input functions, or possibly network sockets or files (depending on code details).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to network sockets, files, or outputs data via print statements. Might include database queries or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment variables, user input, network) to sinks (network, files, console), possibly passing through processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are detected. Code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, following typical patterns for input handling and processing. No suspicious patterns or malicious constructs are evident. Usage of third-party libraries seems appropriate. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic identified. The code lacks obfuscation or unusual constructs. No signs of malware such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate application code with no indications of supply chain attack or malicious intent.",
