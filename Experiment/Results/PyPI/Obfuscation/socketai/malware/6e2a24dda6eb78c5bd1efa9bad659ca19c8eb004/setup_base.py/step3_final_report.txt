  "purpose": "Standard setup script for building a Python extension module using distutils, importing configuration parameters from a setup module.",
  "sources": "Imports from setup module (include_dirs, sources, libraries, define_macros, library_dirs, extra_compile_args, extra_link_args).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; primarily configuration for compilation.",
  "flows": "Configuration variables from setup module flow into Extension object parameters during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and typical for build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup script that constructs an Extension object with parameters imported from a setup module. It conditionally adjusts behavior based on whether running under PyPy. No suspicious logic, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The reports are empty, indicating no analysis or issues reported. Given the lack of evidence, the code appears benign, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign build script with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. The empty reports do not provide any conflicting information. Scores should reflect no malware, obfuscation, or risk, consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
