  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to obfuscated, hidden execution of a PowerShell command during setup. The pattern aligns with common tactics in supply chain attacks or malware distribution. The high scores are justified, and further decoding of the command is recommended for definitive analysis."
