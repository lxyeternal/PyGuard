{
  "purpose": "The code downloads three executables from localhost URLs and executes one of them during package installation, indicating malicious activity intended to establish backdoors or remote control.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/listener_exe', 'payload_exe', and 'Rshell_exe' to download payloads; reading sys.argv for 'install' command.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded content to 'C:\\Windows\\Temp\\' and executing 'Alistener.exe' via subprocess.Popen with hidden process flags.",
  "flows": "On 'install' argument, requests fetch executables from localhost, save to temp directory, then execute 'Alistener.exe' silently.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; download from localhost during setup; execution without validation; use of subprocess with hidden flags.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a function that, when triggered during installation, downloads three executables from localhost URLs and executes one silently. The function name is obfuscated, and no validation of the downloaded files occurs. The execution uses subprocess.Popen with flags to hide the process, suggesting malicious intent. The behavior aligns with malware activity such as establishing backdoors or remote access points. The code's design during setup indicates a supply chain attack vector. The high malware and security risk scores are justified by the silent download and execution of potentially malicious payloads without validation, combined with obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high malicious intent, involving silent download and execution of payloads during package installation, with obfuscation and use of hidden process flags. It should be classified as highly malicious with maximum security risk.",
