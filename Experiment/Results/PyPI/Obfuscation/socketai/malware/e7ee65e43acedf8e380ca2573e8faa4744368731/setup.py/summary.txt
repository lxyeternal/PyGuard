  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion for malicious activity due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup. While the payload content is unknown, the tactics used are characteristic of malware or backdoors. Scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75-0.8, obfuscated ~0.8, security risk ~0.8) are justified and consistent with this behavior. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious intent, but current evidence warrants treating the package as potentially malicious."
