{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to scrape images from the website yiff-party.com, allowing users to get recent images, random images, or stream new uploads based on categories.",
  "sources": "Requests made to yiff-party.com to retrieve webpage content; reading HTML content and extracting 'img' tags; reading environment variables for code execution.",
  "sinks": "Potentially malicious code execution via eval() with obfuscated strings; base64 decoding and eval in combination; HTTP requests to external domains; use of dynamic evaluation functions; data extracted and possibly used for further malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Requests to external website URLs (sources) feed HTML content into BeautifulSoup parsers; extracted image URLs are stored; these URLs are returned or used in functions; eval() executes obfuscated code which is dynamically decoded and run; data flows from HTTP responses into parsed HTML and into eval() statements that execute code; dynamic code execution leads to possible malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() with obfuscated string literals, including base64 decoding and runtime evaluation of string-encoded code; dynamic execution of code from decoded data; possible attempt to hide malicious intent via obfuscation; presence of seemingly random or nonsensical variable names; indirect code execution via eval() and compile().",
  "analysis": "The code includes multiple functions for scraping webpage data from yiff-party.com, extracting image URLs, and selecting images based on categories. It utilizes requests for HTTP GET requests and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML. Notably, it contains obfuscated code segments that decode base64-encoded data and evaluate it dynamically using eval() and compile(). This pattern is a common indicator of attempts to hide malicious behavior. The eval() calls execute code that is constructed at runtime, which can be exploited to run arbitrary or malicious code. The script also retrieves and manipulates data from external URLs, possibly for further malicious actions. The presence of code that executes eval() on obfuscated strings strongly suggests malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior, especially given the obfuscation techniques used.",
  "conclusion": "The script primarily performs web scraping to collect image URLs from a specific website, which is not inherently malicious. However, the use of obfuscated eval() code with base64 decoding indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior or an attempt to conceal malicious actions. The dynamic code execution poses a significant security risk, as it could execute arbitrary code potentially harmful to the system or data. Therefore, the package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious, and its use is strongly discouraged.",
