  "malware_score": 0.85,
  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its heavy obfuscation and use of eval() on base64-encoded strings, which can conceal malicious payloads. It should be considered potentially malicious or at least highly dangerous without sandboxed static or dynamic analysis. The scores are consistent with this assessment."
