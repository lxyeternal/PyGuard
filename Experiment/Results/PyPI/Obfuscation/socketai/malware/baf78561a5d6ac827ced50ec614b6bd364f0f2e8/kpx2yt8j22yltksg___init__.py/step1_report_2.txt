  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but no explicit purpose is clearly identifiable from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external data sources such as files or network if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network transmissions, file writes, or database operations. Specifics are unclear without explicit code, but these are common in such scripts.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like system commands or network functions. Without explicit code, exact paths cannot be detailed.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies like hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are detected in the visible code fragment. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. No malicious code, such as data exfiltration, system sabotage, or backdoors, is evident. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard. No suspicious network activity or file manipulations are apparent. Without external context or hidden code, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no indication of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code looks standard and free from suspicious patterns. Confidence is high that this is safe but limited by the absence of more detailed code.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
