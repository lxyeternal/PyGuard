      "conclusion": "The script shows signs of obfuscation and malformed syntax, which could be attempts to hide malicious intent or simply poor coding practices. No explicit malware or vulnerabilities are detected, but the suspicious elements justify a cautious security assessment. The package should be reviewed further before use."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its heavy obfuscation and use of eval() on base64-encoded strings, which can conceal malicious payloads. It should be considered potentially malicious or at least highly dangerous without sandboxed static or dynamic analysis. The scores are consistent with this assessment."
