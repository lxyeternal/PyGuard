{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration script for a Python package, with additional code that attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command if a certain directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem to check for the existence of 'tahg' directory, and potentially executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The PowerShell command is executed via subprocess.Popen with a hidden window, which could be used to run malicious code without user awareness.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code triggers the subprocess to execute the encoded PowerShell command, which could lead to arbitrary code execution or other malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded and executed with a hidden window, which is suspicious. The code to run the PowerShell command is in a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, hiding potential errors.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing setup from distutils, then checks if the 'tahg' directory exists. If not, it runs a PowerShell command encoded in base64, potentially to download or execute malicious payloads silently. The use of encoded commands and hidden window flags is suspicious. The setup function call appears benign, setting package metadata, but the conditional execution of the encoded PowerShell is a high-risk indicator. The exception handling suppresses errors, reducing visibility into failures. Overall, the code contains malicious intent, likely attempting to run hidden, malicious PowerShell commands during setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by silently executing encoded PowerShell commands in a hidden window, likely to perform malicious actions on the target system. The presence of obfuscated code, hidden execution, and lack of transparency indicates high malicious intent.",
