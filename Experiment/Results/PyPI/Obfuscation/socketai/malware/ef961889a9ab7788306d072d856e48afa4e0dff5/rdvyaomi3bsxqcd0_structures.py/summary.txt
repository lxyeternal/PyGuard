  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated implementation of internal data structures with no active malicious behavior. The main concern is the obfuscation and use of __dict__.get(), which could be exploited if manipulated, but in this context, it does not demonstrate malicious intent. The malware score should be set low, around 0.1, with a high obfuscation score (~0.8) and a moderate security risk (~0.3). Further review of the full codebase is recommended to ensure no malicious logic exists elsewhere."
