  "purpose": "Dependency validation, environment setup, and version checks for cryptography and related libraries.",
  "sources": "Imports of version strings from charset_normalizer, chardet, urllib3, cryptography, and environment variables for version validation.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on version ranges, warnings issued via warnings.warn, and dynamic SSL handling which could affect network security.",
  "flows": "Version strings are read from modules and environment variables, then validated through assertions and warnings; SSL handling may involve dynamic injection.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, complex assertions, dynamic SSL injection handling, and conditional version checks based on presence of modules.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency and environment validation with obfuscated identifiers and complex assertions. It checks library versions, issues warnings if mismatched, and handles SSL configuration dynamically. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment or complexity rather than malicious intent. The assertions could be disabled, which might be a minor security concern, but no malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency and environment validation routine with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero.",
