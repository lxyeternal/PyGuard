  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated, obfuscated cookie management utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains at zero due to lack of malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low, and the supply chain risk from this fragment appears minimal."
