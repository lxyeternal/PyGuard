  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of parts of the 'requests' library, with significant obfuscation that warrants further review. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscation pattern suggests caution. The malware score is low, the obfuscation score is high, and the overall security risk is moderate due to potential concealment."
