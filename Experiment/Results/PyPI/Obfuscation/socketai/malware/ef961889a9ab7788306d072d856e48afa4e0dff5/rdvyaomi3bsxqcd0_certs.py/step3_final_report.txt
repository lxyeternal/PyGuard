  "purpose": "Retrieve and print the path to the CA bundle provided by certifi.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from 'certifi' library.",
  "sinks": "Printing the output of 'where()' to standard output.",
  "flows": "Source: 'where()' function call; Sink: 'print()' function output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'where' from 'certifi' and prints its return value, which is the path to the CA bundle. It does not accept external input, perform network operations, or manipulate data beyond printing a trusted resource path. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is purely informational, and all signals indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a utility to display the certifi CA bundle path. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior, and no adjustments are necessary.",
