{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves and prints the path to the CA bundle file used by the certifi library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the certifi package via the import statement and the 'where' function call.",
  "sinks": "The printed output could be viewed as untrusted if the code is manipulated to modify the output, but as written, it does not send data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input source: the import of certifi and its 'where' function; output sink: the print statement displaying the path.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscated code present. The code performs a straightforward function without unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the certifi package, which returns the path to the CA bundle used for SSL verification. The main block prints this path. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or any malicious activities. The purpose appears to be for debugging or configuration inspection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and intended for utility purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
