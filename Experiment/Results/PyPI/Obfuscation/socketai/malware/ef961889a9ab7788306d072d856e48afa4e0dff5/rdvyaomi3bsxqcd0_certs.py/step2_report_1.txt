  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it to the original code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal script that imports `where` from `certifi` and prints the path to the CA bundle.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and performs a simple utility function.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are identified across all reports.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, and security risk scores are 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues?**  \n  No. All reports confirm the code is simple and correct, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None identified. The code functions as intended.\n\n- **Scores consistency?**  \n  Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. Security risk scores are 0, also appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The purpose of the code is purely informational, displaying the CA bundle path.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or manipulate data beyond printing a trusted resource path.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- **Malware score (0):**  \n  No malicious activity or intent is present. The code only reads from a trusted library and prints the result.\n\n- **Obfuscated score (0):**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security risk score (0):**  \n  The script does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the evidence, I would assign the following scores:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and has no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.**",
