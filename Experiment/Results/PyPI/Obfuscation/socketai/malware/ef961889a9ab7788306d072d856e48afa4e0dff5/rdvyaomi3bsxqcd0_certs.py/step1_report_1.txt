{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves and prints the path to the CA bundle file used by the 'certifi' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'certifi' library through the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data to standard output via 'print'.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function provides a trusted resource path, which is then printed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. Use of 'certifi' is common for SSL certificate validation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' and prints its output if executed as the main program. The operation is straightforward, involving trusted library usage without any data manipulation or external input handling. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and functions solely to output the default CA bundle path used by 'certifi'. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
