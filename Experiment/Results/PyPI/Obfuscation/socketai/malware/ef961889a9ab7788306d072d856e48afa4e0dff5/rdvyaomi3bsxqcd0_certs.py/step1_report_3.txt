{
  "purpose": "The code prints the file path of the current CA bundle used by the 'certifi' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'certifi' library when calling 'where()'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data affects system security or causes data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'where' from 'certifi' and executes it to output the CA bundle path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a straightforward library call without any unusual or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is minimal, importing 'where' from the 'certifi' library and printing the resulting file path. It does not accept external input, modify files, connect to networks, or perform any operations that could be malicious. The code appears to serve the purpose of displaying the location of the trusted CA bundle used for SSL verifications. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and intended solely for informational purposes about the 'certifi' CA bundle location. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
