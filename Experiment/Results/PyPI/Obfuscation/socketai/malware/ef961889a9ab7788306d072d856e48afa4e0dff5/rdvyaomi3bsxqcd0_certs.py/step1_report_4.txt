{
  "purpose": "The code prints the file path of the trusted certificate bundle used by the certifi library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi library via the 'where' function call.",
  "sinks": "The data printed is a file path; no untrusted data input or output effects are evident.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function retrieves a certificate bundle path and outputs it directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from certifi and prints the path to the trusted CA bundle. It is a straightforward utility to display the certifi certificate location. No external input is processed, no data is transmitted, and no suspicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign operation—displaying the certifi CA bundle path—without any malicious intent or security issues.",
