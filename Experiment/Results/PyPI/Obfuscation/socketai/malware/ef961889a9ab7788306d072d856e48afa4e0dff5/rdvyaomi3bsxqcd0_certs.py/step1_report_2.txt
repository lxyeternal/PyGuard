  "flows": "Import -> Call to 'where()' -> print()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious behavior or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports a legitimate function 'where' from the well-known 'certifi' package, which is used to locate the trusted CA bundle. The main block simply prints this location. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Usage is straightforward and aligns with typical Python practices. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign script that outputs the CA bundle location using a standard library package. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
