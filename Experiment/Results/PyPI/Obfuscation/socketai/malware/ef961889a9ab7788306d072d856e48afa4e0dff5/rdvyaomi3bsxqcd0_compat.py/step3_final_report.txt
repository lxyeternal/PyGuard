{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility support between Python 2 and Python 3, specifically handling import issues for 'requests.compat'.",
  "sources": "The code references 'requests.compat' and a version string in comments, which are documentation or import statements.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, network calls, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No active data flows; the code only contains comments and import references.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a strange version string ('fFShQFDKOUWRiaDuBbDwwaWGZezwGlFQ') suggesting placeholder or obfuscation, but no malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is limited to comments and import references with no executable logic. The suspicious string appears to be placeholder or obfuscation, not malicious. No data flows or network activity are present. The scores reflect minimal risk, with malware set to 0, obfuscation slightly elevated due to placeholder text, and overall security risk very low.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is benign, consisting mainly of documentation comments and compatibility imports. The strange version string is likely placeholder or obfuscation, but there is no evidence of malicious activity or security threat.",
