  "purpose": "Provide compatibility functions for importing modules between Python 2 and Python 3",
  "sources": "None explicitly indicated; likely internal imports or conditional logic within the module",
  "sinks": "None indicated; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows based on the description",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; the description suggests straightforward compatibility code",
  "analysis": "The module is intended for compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3, which is a common and benign practice. No code snippets are provided that demonstrate data handling, network communication, or security-sensitive operations. The description indicates it remains for backwards compatibility, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard compatibility shim for handling differences between Python versions. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided description.",
