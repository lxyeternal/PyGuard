  "purpose": "Provides compatibility functions for requests library between Python 2 and Python 3.",
  "sources": "Likely imports or defines compatibility functions internally; no explicit data input sources shown.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks or data leaks indicated; no output or data manipulation shown.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows observed in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The description mentions handling compatibility for Python 2 and 3, which is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. The comment about future versions appears to be standard documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is a descriptive comment about a module that manages compatibility issues across Python versions. It does not contain executable code or data processing logic. No malicious or suspicious behavior can be inferred from a comment alone. Without actual code implementation, there's no indication of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a harmless comment describing a compatibility module used in the requests library. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks in this code fragment.",
