  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a sample or template for a Python package that performs some form of data processing or functionality, but it is not explicitly clear from the code snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly present in the code snippet. If any, they might include external files, network requests, or environment variables, but no such sources are evident here.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network communication functions, file write operations, or system commands, but no specific such functions are observed in the provided code.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows evident in this code snippet, as it mainly consists of variable definitions and simple operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of standard Python syntax without external dependencies or complex logic. No malicious or suspicious patterns are detected. The structure and formatting are normal, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden behavior. The absence of external inputs, network activity, or sensitive operations suggests a benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign and does not exhibit any suspicious or harmful patterns.",
