  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions within a Python package, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local variables, environment variables, and possibly external inputs such as user input or network sources (if any).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data transmissions, but none are explicitly evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like input variables or environment variables to processing functions, with no clear untrusted data reaching sensitive sinks such as network or file systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or unusual variables observed. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is examined for signs of malware or malicious behavior, including data leakage, suspicious network activity, or backdoors. It uses standard Python features without obfuscation. No malicious code segments, such as data exfiltration or reverse shells, are present. Usage of third-party libraries is typical and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard, benign, and aligns with typical utility functions within a package. Confidence in this assessment is high, with a low likelihood of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
