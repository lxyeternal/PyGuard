  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, external data sources, network connections.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network communication, environment variable access, file operations.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via code execution paths, such as eval/exec, network calls, or data handling functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, complex code structures, use of eval/exec, hardcoded strings, suspicious variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits minimal complexity with no suspicious patterns in most reports. Report 3 shows obfuscation and potential for concealment but no confirmed malicious payloads. Scores reflect these observations: malware remains low, obfuscation is elevated only where indicated, and risk scores are low overall. The reasoning in each report aligns with the code characteristics, with a slight adjustment in Report 3's malware score from 0.2 to 0.3 to better represent the suspicion due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent and justified; no significant malicious activity detected. Slightly increased malware score in Report 3 accounts for obfuscation concerns. Overall, the code is benign with cautious monitoring recommended for obfuscated segments.",
