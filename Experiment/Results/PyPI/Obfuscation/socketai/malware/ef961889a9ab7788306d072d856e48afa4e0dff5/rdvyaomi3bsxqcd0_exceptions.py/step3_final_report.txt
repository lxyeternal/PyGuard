{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple heavily obfuscated exception classes, primarily for exception handling, with no active operational logic.",
  "sources": "Import from urllib3.exceptions and local compat module; class attribute definitions with static string constants.",
  "sinks": "None; no I/O, network activity, or data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class inheritance and static attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and variable names; no functional code or payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of numerous class definitions with obfuscated names, inheriting from standard exceptions or custom exceptions, containing only static string attributes. No functions, data flows, or external interactions are present. The obfuscation appears intentional, possibly to conceal purpose or hinder analysis, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or payload execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious activity or security threats detected. The high obfuscation score reflects the naming obscurity, but malware and operational risk scores are low, indicating benign intent. The code does not pose an active security threat based solely on this fragment.",
