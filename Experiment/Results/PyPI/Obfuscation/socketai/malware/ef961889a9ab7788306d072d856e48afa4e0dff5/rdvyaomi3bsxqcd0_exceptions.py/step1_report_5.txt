{
  "purpose": "The code defines a series of custom exception classes, most of which are named with obfuscated or nonsensical names, and several classes inherit from each other and standard exception types. The purpose appears to be to create a complex hierarchy of exception classes, potentially to obfuscate or mask their true intent.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input or external sources; the code primarily defines classes. The only source-like elements are string constants assigned as class variables, which are not used as input sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted input; the code only defines classes and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only establishes class hierarchies and constants, with no execution logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names (e.g., MnkKqMrywZYMeZtKqPUCuXgQlvVecVHZ, FDgxFsnsBeKRLhyodpOrrjDvqXsdIncT) and the use of cryptic string constants suggest intentional obfuscation. No actual malicious code (like network activity, system modifications, or payloads) is present. The inheritance from standard exception classes and the complex hierarchy appear designed to confuse or mask their purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names and adds string constants as class variables. There is no logic, data handling, or external interaction. The presence of obfuscation techniques, such as strange class names and unused string constants, indicates an attempt to conceal intent, but no malicious or harmful actions are implemented within these class definitions. The code appears to be primarily for obfuscation or to create a complex exception hierarchy without a clear functional purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is an obfuscated hierarchy of custom exception classes with no active logic, data flows, or external interactions. The obfuscation suggests an intent to hide or complicate understanding rather than to perform malicious actions.",
