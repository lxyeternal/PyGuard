The scores are generally appropriate and consistent with the evidence, but a slight increase in malware score for report 2 (to 0.8) is recommended to better reflect the suspicion level. The overall malware risk score should be around 0.6, obfuscation around 0.8, and security risk around 0.75, aligning with the most suspicious patterns observed."
