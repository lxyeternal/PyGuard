{
  "purpose": "Calculate the integer average of a list of numbers and provide a simple string response.",
  "sources": "Input list 'li' in calcAverage function",
  "sinks": "Return statement in calcAverage, return statement in lol()",
  "flows": "Input list 'li' -> sum(li) -> return sum(li) // len(li); 'lol()' returns a static string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or suspicious code patterns, no dynamic execution or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code contains two functions: calcAverage and lol. calcAverage sums a list and returns an integer division result, which is standard. lol returns a static string. No external input handling, no data leaks, no code injection points, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscated code. The code performs simple, benign operations with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performs benign calculations, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks.",
