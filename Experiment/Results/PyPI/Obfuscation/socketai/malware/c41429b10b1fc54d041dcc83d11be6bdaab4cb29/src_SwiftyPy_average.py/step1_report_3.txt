  "purpose": "Utility functions for calculating an integer average and returning a string.",
  "sources": "Input source is the list 'li' in calcAverage, which is used for computing the sum.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; functions return values directly.",
  "flows": "Input list 'li' flows into sum and len functions; no data flows into any output that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. Functions are straightforward. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple functions: one for computing an integer average from a list, and another returning a static string. No external inputs are read beyond the function parameters. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not interact with external systems, network, or environment variables. The functions are simple and do not perform any suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be utility code with no malicious intent.",
