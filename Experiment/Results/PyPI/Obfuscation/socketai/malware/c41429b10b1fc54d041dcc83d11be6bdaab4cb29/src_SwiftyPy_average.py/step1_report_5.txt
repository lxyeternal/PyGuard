{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function to calculate the integer average of a list of numbers and a trivial function returning a string 'lol'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input list 'li' in the calcAverage function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is sent or where data leaks could occur are present.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the input 'li' into the sum function, then into the division operation for the average calculation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The functions are straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The calcAverage function computes the sum of the list and performs integer division by the length of the list, which is a standard calculation. The lol function returns a static string with no side effects. There are no external data dependencies, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated elements. The code performs simple operations without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or security-sensitive elements. It poses no security risk.",
