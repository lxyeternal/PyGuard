{
  "purpose": "Calculate the integer average of a list of numbers and return a simple string message.",
  "sources": "Input is received from the 'li' parameter in the calcAverage function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data beyond simple calculation, nor does it perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'li' parameter into the sum and len functions, with no further untrusted data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward function to compute an integer division of the sum of a list by its length, which is a standard operation. The 'lol' function returns a static string and has no interaction with inputs or external systems. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code is simple, clean, and performs basic calculations and string return.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs basic arithmetic and string return operations without any external data interactions or suspicious patterns.",
