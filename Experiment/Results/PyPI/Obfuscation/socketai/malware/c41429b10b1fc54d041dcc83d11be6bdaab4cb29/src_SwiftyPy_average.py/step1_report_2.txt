  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is sent or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input 'li' flows into sum(li) and len(li) in calcAverage; no external or untrusted data flows to other parts of the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two simple functions: 'calcAverage' which calculates the integer average of a list of numbers, and 'lol' which returns a string. There are no external data sources, no suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious intent. The code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply performs basic calculations and returns a string.",
