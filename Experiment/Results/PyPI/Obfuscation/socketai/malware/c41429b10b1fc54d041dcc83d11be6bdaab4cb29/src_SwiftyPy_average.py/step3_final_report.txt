{
  "purpose": "The code provides two simple functions: one calculates an integer average of a list, and the other returns a static string 'lol'.",
  "sources": "Input list 'li' in calcAverage; no external data sources or inputs in lol.",
  "sinks": "Return statements in both functions; no untrusted data handling or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input list flows into sum and len in calcAverage; output returned directly; no external data flow or manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic arithmetic and static string return; no external data handling, network activity, or malicious code detected. The functions are simple, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All signals indicate benign behavior, and the code's operations are safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and performs simple calculations without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with high confidence. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
