  "purpose": "Configure package setup with dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "setuptools import, variable assignment, setup() function call with parameters",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external influence.",
  "flows": "Imports and variable assignment are straightforward; setup() uses static strings.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name 'oRoXjknjAsMMHZlKOiwgAOagtIqYAqNJ' appears obfuscated or nonsensical, but no malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and assigns a version string to a variable with an obscure name, then calls setup() to define package parameters. The install_requires list includes common libraries such as 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. These dependencies are legitimate for various functionalities including web requests and automation. The unusual variable name may suggest obfuscation or intent to hide code, but no malicious actions or behaviors are present. There are no data flows from sources to sinks, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a standard setup script with a questionable variable name but no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with some obfuscated variable naming. No malicious behavior, malware, or security threats are detected based on this code fragment.",
