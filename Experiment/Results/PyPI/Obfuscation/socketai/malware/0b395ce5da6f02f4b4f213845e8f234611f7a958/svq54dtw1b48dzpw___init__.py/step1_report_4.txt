  "purpose": "Import the 'main' function or object from a local module named 'main' within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is the only source, reading the 'main' symbol from the local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a relative import of 'main' from a local module named 'main'. It does not execute any logic, read external input, or perform network operations. As such, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues within this snippet. The code appears to be a typical import statement in a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any actions beyond importing a symbol from a local module.",
