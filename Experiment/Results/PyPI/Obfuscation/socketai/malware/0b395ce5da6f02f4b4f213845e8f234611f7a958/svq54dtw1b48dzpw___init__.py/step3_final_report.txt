  "purpose": "Import 'main' from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs involved.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data from sources to sinks; static import without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import typical in Python projects, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No external data, code execution, or network activity is present. The malware score is appropriately zero, as is the security risk score. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
