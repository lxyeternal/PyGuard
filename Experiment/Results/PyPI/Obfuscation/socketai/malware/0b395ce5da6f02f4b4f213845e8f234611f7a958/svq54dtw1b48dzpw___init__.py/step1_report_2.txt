{
  "purpose": "This code imports the 'main' function from a module named 'main' within the same package.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement itself, which reads the 'main' function from the local package.",
  "sinks": "The import statement can be considered a sink if it executes or loads code dynamically; however, in this static import, it only loads the function definition.",
  "flows": "The flow would be from the module import to any subsequent code that calls or executes 'main', but such code is not present here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are evident in this single import statement. It is a common practice in Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement that imports 'main' from a local module named 'main'. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or unusual constructs present. Since this is a minimal snippet, no malicious intent can be inferred. It appears to be a standard import statement typical of Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a routine part of a Python package.",
