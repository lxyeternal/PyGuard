  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the original code:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```python\nfrom .main import main\n```\n\n**1. Report 1**  \n- Purpose: Import 'main' from local 'main' module — accurate.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data or outputs — correct.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators — correct.  \n- Analysis & Conclusion: Benign import, typical project structure.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**2. Report 2**  \n- Purpose & Sources: Same as above, correct.  \n- Sinks/Flows: No suspicious activity; only static import.  \n- Anomalies: No anomalies detected.  \n- Analysis & Conclusion: Standard import, benign.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**3. Report 3**  \n- Purpose & Sources: Correct.  \n- Sinks/Flows: No data processing or external interaction.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.  \n- Analysis & Conclusion: Simple relative import, benign.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n- Confidence slightly lower (0.9), but still high.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**4. Report 4**  \n- Purpose & Sources: Correct.  \n- Sinks/Flows: No malicious activity.  \n- Anomalies: No anomalies.  \n- Analysis & Conclusion: Standard import, benign.  \n- Scores: all zero, appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**5. Report 5**  \n- Purpose & Sources: Correct.  \n- Sinks/Flows: No suspicious activity.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis & Conclusion: Typical import statement, no malicious intent.  \n- Scores: all zero, appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a benign import statement.  \n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present in any snippet.  \n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.  \n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** Should be 0 for all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be 0 for all reports.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, should be 0 for all reports.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's benign nature. No adjustments needed.",
