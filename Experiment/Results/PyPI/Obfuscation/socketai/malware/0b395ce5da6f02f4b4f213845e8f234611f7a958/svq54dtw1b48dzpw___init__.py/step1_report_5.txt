  "purpose": "This code imports a 'main' function or object from a local module named 'main', likely as part of a larger application or script initialization.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which reads the 'main' object or function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this snippet; it does not perform any operations with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing 'main' from a local module. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network or file operations, and no suspicious behavior. Given the limited context, it appears to be a normal part of a larger program. No malicious intent or security risks are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is likely part of a larger application. Based on this snippet alone, the security risk is negligible.",
