{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function or object named 'main' from a module named 'main' within the same package, likely intended to serve as an entry point or main execution function.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external data directly; it only performs an import statement from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; there are no outputs, network calls, or data leaks evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable within this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This code snippet performs a simple relative import of 'main' from a local module named 'main'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The import suggests a typical project structure. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. Given only this fragment, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger, normal Python project structure.",
