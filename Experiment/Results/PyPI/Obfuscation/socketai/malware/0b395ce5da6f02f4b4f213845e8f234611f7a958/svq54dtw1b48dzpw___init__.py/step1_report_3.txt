{
  "purpose": "Import the main function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code imports a function from a relative module, which indicates data or code flow from the module 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform critical operations.",
  "flows": "Import statement potentially links the current module to 'main', but no data flow is evident beyond that.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no unusual patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement using relative import syntax. It indicates a modular structure where 'main' is a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The snippet alone provides no indication of harmful intent or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, straightforward import statement with no signs of malware or security risks. It appears to be part of a standard Python package structure.",
