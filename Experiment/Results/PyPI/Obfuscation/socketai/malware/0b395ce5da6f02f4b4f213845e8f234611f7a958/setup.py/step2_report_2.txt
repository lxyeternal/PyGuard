  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the appropriateness of their assessments and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the setup script purpose and source.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes potential execution of the entry point, reading files, and filesystem access.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names and inclusion of an '*.exe' file are suspicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately notes obfuscation and unusual package data but finds no direct malicious code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Malware:* 0 — justified, no malicious code observed.  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0.7 — high, given variable names.  \n- *SecurityRisk:* 0.3 — moderate, mainly due to obfuscation and executable inclusion.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and cautious. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the static nature of the setup script.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names, inclusion of '*.exe' — noted but not suspicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious activity, just obfuscation and unusual package data.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Malware:* 0 — justified.  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0.3 — low, consistent with obfuscation but not overly suspicious.  \n- *SecurityRisk:* 0.1 — low.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar reasoning as previous reports, emphasizing standard setup with obfuscation and inclusion of an executable.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Malware:* 0 — justified.  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0.2 — low, consistent with obfuscation.  \n- *SecurityRisk:* 0.1 — low.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Emphasizes standard setup, obfuscation, and inclusion of an executable, with no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Malware:* 0 — justified.  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0.2 — low.  \n- *SecurityRisk:* 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar analysis, noting obfuscation and inclusion of '*.exe', but no malicious code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Malware:* 0 — justified.  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0.6 — somewhat high but acceptable given variable names.  \n- *SecurityRisk:* 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the obfuscation and inclusion of executable files as suspicious but do not find concrete evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Obfuscation scores are high but justified given the variable names.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting the lack of active malicious activity.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.6 — variable names are obfuscated but not necessarily malicious.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — the main concern is obfuscation and inclusion of executables, which warrants caution but not high risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nWhile the obfuscation and inclusion of '*.exe' files are suspicious, they are not definitive proof of malicious intent. It would be prudent to review the contents of the 'hlokty' package and the executable files to confirm their purpose.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- All reports are consistent and reasonable in their assessments.  \n- The scores are appropriate given the evidence.  \n- No significant adjustments are necessary.",
