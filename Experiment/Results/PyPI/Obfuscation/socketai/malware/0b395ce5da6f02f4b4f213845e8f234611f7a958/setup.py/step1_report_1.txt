{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'svq54dtw1b48dzpw' that reads a README file and defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; defining package dependencies and entry points; specifying package data.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of entry point 'hlokty.main:main'; loading external files if triggered; reading from the filesystem.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> setting package metadata -> installing dependencies -> defining entry point -> executing 'hlokty.main:main' when the console script is run.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names (e.g., eEDLpijCUnJwNJVektzVTeFQtCFPRaqZ, APyQJJpqJlplWwOFphRMWMvsPWQcjwAN) are obfuscated and do not follow standard naming conventions, which could indicate attempts to hide purpose. The package data includes a '*.exe' file, unusual for a Python package, which could be suspicious if not justified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names, which raises suspicion. It reads a README file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and an entry point for a console script. The inclusion of an '*.exe' file in package data is uncommon and could be a red flag if the package is intended for Python-only environments. No malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present in this snippet. The obfuscation and inclusion of executable files warrant caution but do not confirm malicious intent solely based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup configuration with obfuscated variable names and inclusion of executable files. While obfuscation and unusual package data are suspicious, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or malware in this code snippet. Overall, it is advisable to review the contents of the 'hlokty' package and its executable files for further assessment.",
