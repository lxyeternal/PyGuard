  "purpose": "A standard Python setup script for packaging, defining dependencies, entry points, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md', package metadata definitions, and inclusion of '*.exe' in package_data.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'hlokty.main:main' entry point, filesystem access, and inclusion of executable files.",
  "flows": "Reading README -> setup configuration -> potential execution of console script; inclusion of '*.exe' in package data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, inclusion of '*.exe' in package data, no code comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py with obfuscated variable names and inclusion of an executable file, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. The obfuscation and executable inclusion raise suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with these observations, with malware scores at 0 and moderate obfuscation scores. The main concern is the inclusion of '*.exe' files, which warrants further inspection but is not definitive evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The package appears to be a legitimate setup configuration with obfuscated variable names and inclusion of executable files. There is no evidence of malicious code or activity. The obfuscation and executable inclusion are red flags that should prompt further review, but based solely on this code snippet, the risk of malware is very low.",
