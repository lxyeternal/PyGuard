  "purpose": "Define type variables for type hinting related to a Client class, supporting static type checking and optional forward references.",
  "sources": "Imports __future__ for annotations, imports TypeVar from typing, conditionally imports from typing_extensions and a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; the code only handles static type annotations.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow involving untrusted inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be standard type hinting setup with conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python typing setup for a project that supports type hints with conditional imports for static analysis tools. It uses 'if TYPE_CHECKING' to import types only during static type checking, preventing runtime overhead. The use of TypeVar to define a generic 'ClientT' is standard. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious code, or security risks. The license header is a standard MIT license notice, unrelated to code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign type hinting setup with no malicious intent or security concerns. It contains no suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious payloads.",
