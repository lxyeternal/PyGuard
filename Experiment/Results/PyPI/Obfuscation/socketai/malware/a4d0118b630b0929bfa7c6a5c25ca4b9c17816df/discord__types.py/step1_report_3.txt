  "purpose": "Define type variables and type annotations for a Python project, supporting type checking and future annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type annotations and conditional imports based on TYPE_CHECKING.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Type annotations are used for type checking; no data flows from external sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses conditional imports for type hints, which is standard for Python type hinting; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a type variable 'ClientT' with conditional imports to support type checking and runtime. It imports from '__future__' for annotations and uses 'TYPE_CHECKING' to avoid runtime imports of type-only modules. The 'TypeVar' is conditionally imported from 'typing_extensions' when type checking, and a 'Client' class is referenced for type bounds. All practices are consistent with standard type hinting conventions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for type annotations and conditional importing for type checking, with no malicious intent or security concerns. It follows standard practices and does not pose security risks.",
