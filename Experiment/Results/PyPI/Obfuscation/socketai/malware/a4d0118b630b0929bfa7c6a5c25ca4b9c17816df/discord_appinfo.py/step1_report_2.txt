{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes representing application information in a Discord API client, including data structures for app info, partial app info, and install parameters.",
  "sources": "Data sources include the data parameter in constructors (__init__ methods), which is passed from external API responses, and some optional fields in the data payload.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network calls, file writes, or environment variable manipulations are present. No data is used in potentially dangerous ways.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external API payloads into class instances via constructors. No untrusted data is processed in insecure or malicious ways; there are no source-to-sink flows that could lead to exploitation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code uses standard class definitions, data parsing, and property accessors. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data class definitions for storing application info related to Discord's API. It uses safe, conventional methods to parse and expose data, including optional fields and data transformations. No network activity, system commands, or insecure operations are present. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is evident. The code appears to serve as a straightforward data model without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured implementation of data classes for Discord application info. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It is safe and does not pose a supply chain security threat.",
