  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The code models application info data for Discord, with data sourced from input dictionaries during object creation.  \n- **Sinks & Anomalies:** No external or dangerous sinks; no suspicious or obfuscated code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** It’s standard data modeling with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on application info data structures.  \n- **Sinks & Anomalies:** No dangerous operations; standard class definitions.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, straightforward data classes with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Defines classes for application metadata, with input data from external payloads.  \n- **Sinks & Anomalies:** No system effects, network calls, or code execution.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; standard data handling.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Data classes for app info, with asset retrieval methods that process stored identifiers.  \n- **Sinks & Anomalies:** Asset creation functions are local; no untrusted data execution.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just data modeling.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to previous, focusing on data parsing and asset retrieval.  \n- **Sinks & Anomalies:** No dangerous operations; safe data handling.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No security issues or malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is purely data modeling for Discord application info, with no network activity, no code execution, no environment variable manipulation, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Consistently zero across all reports, which aligns with the code’s nature.\n- **Security Risk:** No evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard implementation of data classes, parsing payloads into object attributes.\n- Asset properties rely on helper methods to generate asset objects from stored identifiers; these are safe and local.\n- No external or untrusted data is executed or transmitted.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n**Estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** 0 — standard data models with no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and does not pose any supply chain security threat.",
