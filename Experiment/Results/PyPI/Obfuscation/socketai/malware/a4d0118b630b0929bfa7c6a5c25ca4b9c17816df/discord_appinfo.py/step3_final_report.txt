  "purpose": "Data models representing Discord application info, including app details, assets, and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "External payload data during object initialization; no external input or data streams beyond payloads.",
  "sinks": "Property methods converting stored data into Asset objects; no external or system effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from payload dictionaries into class attributes; asset properties generate Asset instances from stored identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward data classes with attributes initialized from payload data. Asset retrieval methods are local and do not execute untrusted code or perform network operations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external system effects are present. The structure adheres to standard API client modeling, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and safe, serving as data models for Discord application information without any malicious or security concerns.",
