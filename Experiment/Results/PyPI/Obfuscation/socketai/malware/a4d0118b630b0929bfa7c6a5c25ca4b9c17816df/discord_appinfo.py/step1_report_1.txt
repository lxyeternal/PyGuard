{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for handling application information and related data in a Discord API context, including AppInfo, PartialAppInfo, and AppInstallParams, primarily for data modeling and retrieval.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the provided 'data' dictionaries during object initialization; no external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network requests, file writes, or environment variable accesses are present. Asset retrievals are local object property accesses.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries into class attributes during initialization; no untrusted data flows into critical system functions or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code follows standard data modeling patterns for a Discord API client.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes with constructors that populate attributes from provided payloads, with no dynamic code execution or insecure operations. Asset properties use helper methods to generate asset objects from internal data. The code does not perform network requests, command execution, or environment variable access. No obfuscated or suspicious language features are detected. The overall structure is typical for API data models, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation of data classes for Discord application info handling, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities detected. It operates solely on provided data and does not contain any malicious payloads or suspicious operations.",
