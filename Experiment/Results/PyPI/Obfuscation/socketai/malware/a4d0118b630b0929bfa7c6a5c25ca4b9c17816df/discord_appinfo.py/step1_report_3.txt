{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes representing application information for a Discord bot, including metadata, assets, and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from external payloads during object initialization (e.g., AppInfoPayload, PartialAppInfoPayload, InstallParamsPayload).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data into system effects are evident; the code mainly stores and retrieves data without executing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from payloads into class attributes; no untrusted data is executed or transmitted over the network or to system components.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of type annotations and property accessors appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of data models for Discord application info, with safe handling of optional and nested data. No dynamic code execution, no network connections, and no storage or transmission of sensitive data are visible. It utilizes helper functions for data parsing, and all data flows are read-only with respect to the provided payloads. The code structure is conventional, and no malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard data modeling module for Discord application info, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and free from supply chain attacks or sabotage.",
