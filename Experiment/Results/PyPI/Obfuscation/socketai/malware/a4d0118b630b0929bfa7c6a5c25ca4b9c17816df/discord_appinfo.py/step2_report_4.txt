  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code models application info, data comes from payloads, no external input sources beyond this.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or file operations; data flows into class attributes during init.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard data classes, no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe data handling, no external effects.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on data storage and asset retrieval, no execution or external calls.\n- **Scores:** zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk are correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Details about data flow and asset methods, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** consistent with safe, standard data modeling.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Reiterates the same points: data from API payloads, no external or malicious actions.\n- **Scores:** appropriately zero.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence:** The code is purely data modeling for Discord API info, with no malicious or suspicious operations.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as there's no security vulnerability or malicious intent.\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on all reports, the code appears to be a standard, well-structured data model with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses and the code's straightforward nature.",
