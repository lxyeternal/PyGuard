{
  "purpose": "Defines two classes, EqualityComparable and Hashable, providing equality comparison and hashing based on an 'id' attribute.",
  "sources": "The 'id' attribute in the classes, which is intended to be set externally or by subclasses.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process external inputs or output data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions for comparison and hashing mechanisms using a numeric 'id'. It includes standard Python practices and no external data handling. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The only potential concern is the assumption that 'id' is properly assigned externally, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of comparison and hashing classes with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, safe utility code.",
