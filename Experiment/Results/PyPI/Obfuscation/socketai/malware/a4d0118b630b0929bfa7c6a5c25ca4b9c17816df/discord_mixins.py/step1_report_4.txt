{
  "purpose": "Define two classes, EqualityComparable and Hashable, with simple equality and hash functions based on an 'id' attribute.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it relies solely on class attributes within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code involves simple class definitions with attribute comparisons and hashing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class structures with basic equality and hash implementations. It does not perform any input/output operations, network activity, or data processing. The hash function shifts the 'id' attribute by 22 bits, which is a straightforward computation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a standard implementation of comparable and hashable objects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, implementing simple equality and hashing mechanisms without any malicious intent or security risks. It is typical application code defining utility classes.",
