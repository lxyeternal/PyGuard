{
  "purpose": "Defines two classes, EqualityComparable and Hashable, for object comparison and hashing based on an 'id' attribute.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'id' attribute of instances of the classes.",
  "kills": "There are no external inputs or untrusted data sources; the code does not perform any I/O or data collection.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; class methods operate on instance attributes only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes class inheritance with simple comparison and hashing logic. No external data inputs are processed, nor are there any network or file operations. The 'id' attribute is used for comparison and hashing, which is typical for such classes. The code appears to be straightforward and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of comparison and hashing classes, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
