  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code to verify claims, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Correctly states that the code manages WebSocket events, heartbeats, reconnections, and dispatching for Discord. The code reads incoming WebSocket frames, processes op codes, and sends identification, resume, heartbeat, and presence payloads. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The code appears standard for a Discord client.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** The report assigns malware = 0 and securityRisk = 0.2, with high confidence (0.9). Given the code's functions, this seems reasonable. No malicious behavior is evident, and the risk is low.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Accurately describes the WebSocket classes for Discord gateway and voice, with proper handling of connection, heartbeat, and message dispatch. No suspicious or malicious logic is identified. The code uses threading and asyncio, which is typical in such clients.\n\n- **Anomalies & Malicious Indicators:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are observed. The detailed handling of reconnection, session invalidation, and event dispatching aligns with standard implementations.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware score is 0, securityRisk is 0.1, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:** The analysis is consistent with the code. No modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Correctly notes that the code handles WebSocket messages, environment variables, and outgoing payloads for identify, resume, heartbeat, and voice. The flow is typical, with no suspicious data or logic.\n\n- **Anomalies & Malicious Indicators:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. Use of threading and asyncio is standard.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1. These are appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Accurately describes the WebSocket client handling for Discord, including message processing, heartbeat, reconnection, and voice protocols. No suspicious or malicious activity is apparent.\n\n- **Anomalies & Malicious Indicators:** No obfuscated code, secrets, or network connections outside expected domains. The code appears legitimate.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2. This seems reasonable given the code's scope.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's assessment is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Correctly states that the code manages WebSocket events, heartbeat, and voice, with proper handling of incoming and outgoing messages. No suspicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Anomalies & Malicious Indicators:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The code's structure is typical.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** All reports correctly describe the code as implementing standard Discord WebSocket and voice protocols. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or secrets are present.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which is consistent with the code.\n\n- **Security Risk:** The risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), aligning with the code's functions, which are typical for a Discord client.\n\n- **Potential Discrepancies:** The reports are consistent with each other and with the code. No report overstates the risk or malware potential.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0.0** — No malicious activity or payloads are evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.0** — Code is clear, structured, and uses standard patterns.\n\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Slightly above zero due to the nature of network communication, but nothing suspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of Discord's WebSocket and voice connection protocols. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is detectable. The existing reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware: **0.0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0.0**  \n- Risk: **0.1**",
