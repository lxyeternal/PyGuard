  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of Discord WebSocket and voice protocols. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (low), confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code handles WebSocket communication, heartbeats, reconnections, and event dispatching as expected. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate given the code's function.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a standard WebSocket client for Discord, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The detailed reasoning confirms no malicious behavior. The code manages connection, heartbeat, and event dispatching properly.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues or malware present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard WebSocket client implementation with proper handling of incoming/outgoing messages, reconnections, and heartbeats.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes the absence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is legitimate, with no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard Discord WebSocket client code, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no suspicious network activity or backdoors are observed.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports; standard WebSocket handling for Discord, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The code functions as expected for a Discord client.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the detailed reasoning supports this. The code contains no malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert channels.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), but all are low, reflecting the code's purpose as a WebSocket client for Discord.\n\n**Given the detailed reasoning, the code's functions, and the lack of any suspicious activity, I concur with the provided scores.**\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with low-level security risk for a WebSocket client)\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of Discord's WebSocket and voice protocols, with no malware or obfuscation.**",
