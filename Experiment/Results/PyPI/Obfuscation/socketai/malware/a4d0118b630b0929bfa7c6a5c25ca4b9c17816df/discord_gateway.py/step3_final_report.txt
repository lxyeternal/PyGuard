{
  "purpose": "Standard WebSocket handling for Discord's gateway and voice protocols, managing connection, message dispatch, heartbeats, and reconnections.",
  "sources": "Incoming WebSocket frames, environment variables, internal state (session ID, sequence, token).",
  "sinks": "Outgoing WebSocket messages including identify, resume, heartbeat, presence, voice data, and reconnection signals.",
  "flows": "Incoming frames are decompressed, parsed, and dispatched to event handlers; outgoing data is sent via functions like identify, resume, heartbeat, and voice commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical Discord WebSocket client, handling events, heartbeats, reconnections, and dispatching with standard patterns. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert channels are present. The threading and asyncio usage are appropriate for such clients. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1) are consistent with the code's functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of Discord's WebSocket and voice protocols. No malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation detected. The security risk is very low, and the malware likelihood is negligible.",
