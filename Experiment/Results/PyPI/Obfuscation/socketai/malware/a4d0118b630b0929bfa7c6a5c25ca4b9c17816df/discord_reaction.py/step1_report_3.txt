{
  "purpose": "Defines a Reaction class for handling message reactions, including methods for removing reactions, clearing reactions, and fetching users who reacted.",
  "sources": "Reads data from reaction payloads, message state, and network requests (http.get_reaction_users).",
  "sinks": "Uses network requests to get reaction users, and removes reactions via message methods.",
  "flows": "Reaction data is initialized from payloads; user list retrieval involves network calls to get_reaction_users; removal and clearing involve message methods that likely make HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, or obfuscated code. No hidden backdoors or data leaks evident.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of reaction handling in a Discord-like bot library. It interacts with message objects, manages reactions, and fetches user data via HTTP API calls. All network interactions seem to be standard API calls for reaction user data. No suspicious or malicious code patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present. No hardcoded secrets or environment variables are detected. The structure is straightforward and typical for such a library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, non-malicious implementation of reaction management in a messaging bot library. It makes standard network requests, handles user data, and provides APIs for reaction interactions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
