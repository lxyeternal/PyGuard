  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal setup script using setuptools.\n- Package name: 'wjwshrskp77m7w9o' (appears random/obfuscated).\n- Version: '1.0.0'.\n- Dependency: 'requests==2.31.0'.\n- No runtime code, no dynamic behavior, no input/output, no data flows, no code execution beyond static configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, backdoors, or dynamic behavior.\n- The package name is obfuscated or random, which could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious.\n- No vulnerabilities are introduced by the static dependency declaration.\n- No data flows, no external inputs, no sinks.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify the package name as obfuscated but do not overstate the risk.\n- The analysis appropriately notes the lack of malicious activity.\n- No false positives or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code content.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.5; given the package name looks random, a score of 0.5 in some reports seems reasonable, but 0.2-0.5 is acceptable.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, as no dynamic code or external input is involved.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- The only concern is the obfuscated package name, which might suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent. However, without evidence of malicious code, the risk remains low.\n- The malware score should remain 0; no malware is present.\n- The obfuscated score could be slightly higher if the name is suspicious, but given the evidence, 0.5 is acceptable.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment: benign static configuration, obfuscated name but no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.4-0.5 (moderate suspicion due to name)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2-0.3 (low, considering no malicious activity)\n\n### Overall Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.4\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe package appears benign, with obfuscation being the only minor concern. No evidence supports higher risk or malware suspicion.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard setup script with an obfuscated package name but no malicious behavior. The current scores are reasonable; I would slightly adjust the obfuscated score to 0.4 and keep the risk low at 0.2, reflecting the benign nature of this static configuration.",
