  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for distribution, specifying package name, version, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'setuptools', parameters in 'setup()' function defining package name, version, and required dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external output is involved in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only configures package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'wjwshrskp77m7w9o' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static arguments for package name, version, and a fixed dependency on 'requests==2.31.0'. There are no dynamic or user input elements, no code execution beyond static configuration. The package name does not suggest malicious intent but could indicate obfuscation or a randomly generated name. Overall, the code performs a standard package setup without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package with no evident malicious intent. The only unusual aspect is the package name, which may warrant further context but does not imply malicious activity on its own.",
