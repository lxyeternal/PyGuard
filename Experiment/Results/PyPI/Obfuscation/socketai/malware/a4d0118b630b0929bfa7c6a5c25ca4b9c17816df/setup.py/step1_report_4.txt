  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration for packaging a Python project with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function and 'install_requires' list, which specify package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Installation process of dependencies, which could potentially be compromised if dependencies are malicious (e.g., 'requests').",
  "flows": "The setup script loads dependencies during installation; no direct data flow from untrusted sources in the code itself.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'wjwshrskp77m7w9o' appears random and nonsensical, which is suspicious. The dependency version is explicitly pinned but normal; no hardcoded credentials or code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. The package name appears unusual and could be an attempt at obfuscation or a random package. The dependency 'requests==2.31.0' is a legitimate library version. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious logic is present. No input, output, or dynamic code execution observed. The script itself is minimal and standard for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with a suspicious package name but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual package name warrants further investigation outside this script, but based solely on this code, it appears benign.",
