{
  "purpose": "Define various enumeration classes for a Discord-related library, providing structured constants for use throughout the codebase.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard modules (__future__, types, collections, typing) and the code itself, which defines enum classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data are present; the code mainly defines constants and helper functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily establishes enum classes and utility functions for enum handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be standard enum class definitions with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple enum classes using a custom metaclass, for structured constants relevant to a Discord API wrapper. It includes utility functions for handling unknown enum values. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. All functions and classes serve standard purposes such as creating immutable enums, mapping values, and providing string representations. The import statements and code structure are typical for such a library, with no suspicious patterns or potential attack vectors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of enumerations for a Discord API library, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It focuses on defining constants and utility functions without any harmful or suspicious logic.",
