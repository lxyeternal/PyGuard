  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines enum classes and utility functions for a Discord API library, primarily from enum member definitions and type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or untrusted sources are processed; the data flows are internal and controlled.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The fallback functions for unknown enum values are standard practices for robust enum handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears benign, well-structured, with a high confidence level (0.95). No malware or security risks are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, it describes enum definitions and utility functions with no external data handling or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; the code is standard enum management.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, enum class definitions with no external data or dynamic code execution.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent or vulnerabilities; standard enum code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: enum classes, utility functions, no external data or suspicious logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; seems benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 are suitable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous, standard enum definitions, no external data processing.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely defining enums and helper functions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2) due to the fallback mechanisms for unknown enum values, but these are standard and safe practices.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Minimal, inherent in fallback handling but not dangerous.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured enumeration system for a Discord API library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.",
