{
  "purpose": "Defines enum classes and utility functions for a Discord API library, providing structured constants and safe handling of unknown enum values.",
  "sources": "Static enum member definitions, internal utility functions for fallback values.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or untrusted input processing; purely static definitions.",
  "flows": "Internal enum value mapping and fallback functions ensure safe conversions; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a custom enum system with safe fallback mechanisms (`create_unknown_value`, `try_enum`) to handle unknown values. It is well-structured, with no network activity, data leaks, or malicious patterns. The utility functions are standard for robust enum handling, and the overall design is typical for a library defining constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured enumeration framework for a Discord API client or library, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
