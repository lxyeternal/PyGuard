{
  "purpose": "The code defines a comprehensive set of flag classes for Discord entities, such as messages, users, intents, and channels. These classes facilitate internal management of feature flags via bitwise operations, decorators, and operator overloading, without external data handling or network activity.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, decorator functions, constructor keyword arguments, and method return values that set or retrieve internal flag states.",
  "sinks": "Internal bitwise manipulations and state updates; no external data sinks, network calls, or code execution involving untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (kwargs) to class constructors set internal flag values; no external data flows or untrusted data reaching external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious backdoors detected. The code uses standard Python features for flag management.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple classes representing different Discord feature flags, all utilizing decorators to define valid flags and default values. Operator overloading allows intuitive bitwise operations. No external I/O, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The purpose is solely internal state management of feature flags, with validation ensuring safe usage. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, purpose-specific implementation of flag management for a Discord Python library. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or external system interactions. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0.",
