{
  "purpose": "Define a comprehensive set of flag classes for Discord-related entities such as messages, users, intents, and channels, enabling bitwise operations for feature toggles and attribute access.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library modules (__future__, functools, operator, typing), and internal enum import (UserFlags). No external or untrusted data sources are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not write or execute untrusted data or code, nor does it handle user input or network data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted input to sensitive operations or outputs. The class methods manipulate internal bitflag states without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code consists of well-structured flag classes with no runtime code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple flag classes with bitwise operations, leveraging Python's typing, class decorators, and operator overloading for flexible flag management. It imports only standard modules and internal enums, with no handling of external or untrusted data sources. There is no code execution, network activity, or credential handling present. The structure aligns with typical library code for feature flags, and no signs of malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of well-structured, standard flag management classes for Discord entities, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs internal flag manipulations without external data processing or network interactions.",
