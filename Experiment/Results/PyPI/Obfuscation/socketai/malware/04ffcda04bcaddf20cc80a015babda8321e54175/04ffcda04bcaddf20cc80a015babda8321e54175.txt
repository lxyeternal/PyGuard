      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the use of obfuscated, silent PowerShell execution during package setup. The behavior aligns with common malware tactics, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The current assessments are appropriate; I recommend decoding the payload for confirmation. Until verified, treat this package as malicious or compromised."
