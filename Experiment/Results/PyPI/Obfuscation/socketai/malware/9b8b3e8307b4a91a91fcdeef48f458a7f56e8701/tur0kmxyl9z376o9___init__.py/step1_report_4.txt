  "sinks": "exec(b.b64decode(...)) — executing dynamically decoded code, which may lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "Decoding base64 string -> execution of the decoded code via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with decoded data; large base64 payload; obfuscated approach; no comments or clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the base64 module as 'b', then decodes a long base64 string and executes the resulting code dynamically with exec(). This pattern is often used in malicious scripts to hide payloads. The decoded payload likely contains further malicious or obfuscated code. Since the payload is not human-readable in its current form, this is a high-risk indicator. The use of base64 encoding and exec() suggests an attempt to conceal malicious intent or evade static analysis. The payload might perform unauthorized actions such as system access, data theft, or other malicious behaviors once executed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious and likely malicious due to the use of obfuscation, dynamic execution, and a large encoded payload. It aims to decode and execute arbitrary code, which is a common tactic for malicious activities.",
