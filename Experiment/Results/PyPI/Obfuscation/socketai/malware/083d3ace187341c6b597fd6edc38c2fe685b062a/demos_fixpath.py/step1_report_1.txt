  "purpose": "Modify the Python module search path to include the parent directory of the current file",
  "sources": "Reads the __file__ variable to determine current script location",
  "sinks": "sys.path.insert, which modifies the module search path",
  "flows": "Source (__file__) -> path manipulation -> sys.path.insert",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable name GAjDOqaCKiGLQWFlMkqspQZpOOdolaxv; no other suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code calculates the normalized path of the parent directory relative to the current file and inserts it at the start of sys.path. This is a common pattern to ensure local modules can be imported easily. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated but is used in a benign manner. No hardcoded secrets, data exfiltration, or malicious activities are present. The code structure is straightforward and typical for modifying import paths.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to adjust the module search path for local imports; it shows no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
