  "purpose": "Set up the module import path by adding the parent directory of the current file to sys.path",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ to determine current file location and importing sys for path manipulation",
  "sinks": "Modifying sys.path which could affect module import behavior",
  "flows": "Uses __file__ to compute a directory path, then inserts this into sys.path",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable name GAjDOqaCKiGLQWFlMkqspQZpOOdolaxv; no other suspicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically computes the parent directory of the current script and prepends it to sys.path, affecting module import resolution. The variable name appears obfuscated but does not impact functionality. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious network activity. The code performs a standard directory manipulation for import purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily adjusting the module search path. No malicious intent detected; variable naming may suggest obfuscation but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
