  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscation and dynamic execution of an encoded payload. While static analysis cannot confirm the payload's content, the pattern suggests potential malware. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; I would rate malware at 0.8, obfuscation at 0.9, and overall security risk at 0.85. This package should be treated as potentially malicious until further payload analysis confirms safety."
