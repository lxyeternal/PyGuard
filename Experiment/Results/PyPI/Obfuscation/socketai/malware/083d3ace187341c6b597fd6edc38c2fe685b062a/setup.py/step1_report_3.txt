    "Unusual pattern of dynamically executing code from an encoded string, which is not typical for a standard setup script"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and attempts to read a version string from a file, which is typical for a setup script. However, it also includes a base64-encoded string that, when decoded, is compiled and executed dynamically. This pattern is often associated with obfuscation or malicious payloads, as it conceals what the code actually does until runtime. The obfuscated code likely executes additional code that is not visible in this static analysis. The rest of the script involves setting up package metadata, which appears normal. The presence of dynamic execution and obfuscated code strongly suggests potential malicious intent, especially if the decoded content performs unauthorized actions or exfiltrates data.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated dynamic code execution which is suspicious and potentially malicious. While it may be intended to run setup tasks, the obfuscation and dynamic execution raise security concerns. This pattern warrants further investigation into the decoded content. Overall, the code poses a security risk due to its hidden execution logic, with a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
