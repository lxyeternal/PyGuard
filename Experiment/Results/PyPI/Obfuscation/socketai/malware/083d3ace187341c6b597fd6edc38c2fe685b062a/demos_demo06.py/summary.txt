  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated with random data generation and obscure imports, raising suspicion but lacking evidence of active malicious behavior such as network activity or data theft. The low malware score (~0.2) and high obfuscation (~0.8) are appropriate. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.3). Continuous monitoring and further dynamic analysis are recommended if part of a larger supply chain component."
