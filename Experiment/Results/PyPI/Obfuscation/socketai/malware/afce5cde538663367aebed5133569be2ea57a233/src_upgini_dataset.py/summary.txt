  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of significant obfuscation and complex network/file operations that could be exploited maliciously, including covert data exfiltration. While no direct malicious payloads are evident, the structure justifies a high security concern. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment."
