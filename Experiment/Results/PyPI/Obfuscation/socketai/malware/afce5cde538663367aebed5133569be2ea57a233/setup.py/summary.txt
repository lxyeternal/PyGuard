  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious external communication during package setup, likely for tracking or data exfiltration, with obfuscated code indicating concealment. While no direct malicious payloads are evident, the behavior warrants caution due to privacy implications and potential misuse. The malware score is set at 0.5, reflecting moderate suspicion without definitive malicious payloads. Obfuscation and security risk scores are high, at 0.7 and 0.75 respectively, due to covert data transmission and concealment efforts."
