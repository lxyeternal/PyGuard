{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with obfuscated names, including conditional behavior based on status_code, primarily for error handling.",
  "sources": "Class __new__ method checking 'status_code' and formatting error messages; exception instantiations with message strings.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no external data access, network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation flows through class constructors; __new__ method may redirect exception class based on 'status_code'.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class and variable names; dynamic class replacement in __new__; no external data or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines obfuscated custom exception classes, with one class overriding __new__ to replace itself with another exception class if 'status_code' equals 401. No malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration are evident. The obfuscation and dynamic class switching could be used to conceal malicious intent, but in this isolated context, it appears to serve error handling purposes. The exception message formatting includes tokens, which could leak sensitive info if misused, but no such leaks are present here. Overall, the code is primarily obfuscated error handling logic with no active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but functions as a set of custom error classes with conditional exception substitution. There is no evidence of malicious activity, payloads, or external data leaks. The obfuscation could be used to hide malicious intent, but in this context, it appears benign. The supply chain risk is low, with the main concern being obfuscation rather than malicious behavior.",
