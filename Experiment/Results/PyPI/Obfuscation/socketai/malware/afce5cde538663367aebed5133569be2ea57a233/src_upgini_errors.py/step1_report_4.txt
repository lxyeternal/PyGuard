{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios, possibly related to authorization and error reporting.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from exception arguments, particularly 'QzaJKgyfUmjxBMdsCyBclWNLgPYYKUkC' which may contain error messages or tokens.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages and string formatting could potentially be used to inject malicious content if untrusted input is passed, but in this context, it seems intended for error reporting.",
  "flows": "Data flows from exception initialization arguments into formatted strings and exception chaining; no direct external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Class and variable names are obfuscated, making intent unclear. The __new__ method conditionally assigns a different exception class based on 'status_code' without any evident security benefit or clear reason, which is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes, some with obfuscated names. The class 'ZbzzxvNXGjkdnbCMnCEHdFHuOlGpetWU' overrides __new__ to replace the instance with another exception class if 'status_code' equals 401, which could be used to manipulate error handling flow. The class 'rrWNChLTIkiCjIUFlXVddTMDFAwPaiys' formats an error message with a provided token, possibly for reporting unauthorized access. Other classes are straightforward custom exceptions with no active logic. The obfuscated names and the __new__ override are suspicious but not inherently malicious; they could be used for obfuscation or control flow manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily consists of obfuscated custom exception classes with some unusual design choices such as dynamic class replacement. There are no clear signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The obfuscation and the __new__ method override are suspicious but not definitive. Overall, the code appears to be a complex error handling setup with obfuscated identifiers and conditional exception creation, likely intended for controlled error responses rather than malicious activity.",
