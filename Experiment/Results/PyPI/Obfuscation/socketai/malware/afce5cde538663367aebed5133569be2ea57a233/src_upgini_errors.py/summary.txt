  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but functions as a set of custom error classes with conditional exception substitution. There is no evidence of malicious activity, payloads, or external data leaks. The obfuscation could be used to hide malicious intent, but in this context, it appears benign. The supply chain risk is low, with the main concern being obfuscation rather than malicious behavior."
