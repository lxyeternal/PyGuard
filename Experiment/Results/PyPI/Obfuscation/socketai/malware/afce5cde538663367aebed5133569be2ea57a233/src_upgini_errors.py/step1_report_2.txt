  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions, possibly related to authorization and general errors.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading sources; the code defines classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data output, network transmission, or file writing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; class instantiations and exception handling are internal.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; unusual use of __new__ method for conditional exception instantiation; no apparent malicious intent but obfuscation could hide malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes with obfuscated names. One class overrides __new__ to conditionally assign a different exception class based on the 'status_code' parameter, which could be used to mask malicious behavior. The classes themselves do not perform any malicious actions, and there are no data leaks, network activity, or system modifications. The obfuscation and unusual exception class switching could potentially be used to conceal malicious intent or obscure behavior, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be primarily for defining custom exception classes with obfuscated names. The use of __new__ to switch exception types based on status code is unusual but not inherently malicious. There are no signs of malicious payloads or malicious behaviors within this code fragment. The obfuscation could be a concern for concealment, but the code as-is does not perform any harmful actions.",
