  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code defines obfuscated custom exception classes, with one class (__new__ method) conditionally replacing the exception class if status_code == 401. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious payloads are evident.  \n- **Assessment:** The obfuscation and dynamic class creation could be used to hide malicious intent, but there's no direct evidence of malicious activity. The overall design appears to be for error handling with obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.9 — reasonable given the obfuscation but no malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security risk beyond obfuscation.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar obfuscated exception classes, with a __new__ method that switches exception types based on status_code. No signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** The pattern is consistent with complex error handling, not malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.6 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Primarily obfuscation, no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Exception classes with potential for leaking sensitive info via messages, but no external data flows or malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Obfuscation and dynamic behavior are suspicious but not malicious.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.7 — consistent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated error handling, no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar pattern—obfuscated classes, conditional exception creation, no malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Obfuscation could be for concealment, but no evidence of malicious actions.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.8 — reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** Error handling with obfuscation, no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern—obfuscated class names, __new__ method for conditional exception instantiation, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Likely for error handling, obfuscation to conceal intent, but no malicious actions detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.7 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no signs of malicious activity, payloads, or external data exfiltration. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** High, as the code is intentionally obfuscated with strange class and variable names, and dynamic class creation.  \n- **Risk Score:** Very low, as there's no evidence of malicious activity, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities beyond obfuscation.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0.8** — the code is heavily obfuscated, which could be used to hide malicious intent but isn't necessarily malicious.  \n- **Risk:** **0.2** — primarily obfuscation, no active vulnerabilities or exploits.\n\n### Critical Note:\nThe obfuscation is suspicious but not sufficient evidence of malicious activity. The dynamic exception handling could be misused in malicious contexts, but in this code, it seems to serve error handling purposes.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is obfuscated error handling classes with no clear malicious activity.  \n- The scores should reflect high obfuscation but zero malware risk.  \n- The overall security risk remains low, with the main concern being the obfuscation itself, which warrants cautious static analysis but does not currently indicate a supply chain threat.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8  \n- **Risk:** 0.2",
