  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions, particularly related to authorization and generic errors.",
  "sources": "Exception instantiations and condition checks within the class constructors and __new__ methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially logging or error handling mechanisms that may use these exceptions; no explicit data sinks are visible in the code provided.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised based on input parameters, with some flow control in __new__ method to instantiate specific subclasses based on status_code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names, use of __new__ to alter exception instantiation, and unusual variable naming; no hardcoded secrets or external data access. No suspicious external calls or code injections.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, with one class (__new__ method) dynamically returning an instance of a different class based on a condition (status_code == 401). The class rrWNChLTIkiCjIUFlXVddTMDFAwPaiys formats an error message indicating an authorization issue. The overall structure appears to serve error handling purposes without evident malicious behavior. Obfuscation and complex naming suggest possible concealment, but no concrete malicious actions like data exfiltration, network activity, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be an obfuscated set of custom exception classes designed for error handling, particularly for authorization errors. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain attacks. The complexity and naming are suspicious but not malicious in intent. Overall security risk is low.",
