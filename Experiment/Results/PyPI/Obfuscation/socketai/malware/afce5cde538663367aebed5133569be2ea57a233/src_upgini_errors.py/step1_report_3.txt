{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error conditions, including unauthorized access and other generic errors.",
  "sources": "Input data is processed in the constructors (__init__ methods) where exception messages are formatted using input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages that include input parameters could potentially leak sensitive information if untrusted data is used directly in error messages.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., authorization tokens or error details) flow into exception messages, which are then raised or logged. The custom exception classes do not explicitly handle or process external data beyond message formatting.",
  "anomalies": "The class names and variable names are obfuscated, making understanding of their purpose difficult. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are evident. The code uses unusual class naming conventions and a dynamic __new__ method in one class. The code does not perform network operations, file I/O, or other suspicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes with obfuscated names. One class (rrWNChLTIkiCjIUFlXVddTMDFAwPaiys) dynamically alters its behavior based on a 'status_code' parameter, possibly to raise a specific exception for 401 Unauthorized errors. The overall structure resembles typical error handling mechanisms, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to hide the class purpose or to complicate static analysis, but no malicious activity or supply chain attacks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to define custom exception classes with obfuscated naming, possibly to obscure intent. There is no indication of malicious behavior or malware. The code is mostly standard error handling with some obfuscation but does not pose security risks based on current analysis.",
