  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions, including unauthorized access and general errors.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading occurs; code defines classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiations and raising, which could influence control flow but do not directly leak data.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects with potential data (like error messages) flowing into exception handling routines.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class and variable names; dynamic behavior in __new__ method that conditionally alters exception instantiation; no clear input validation or sanitization; no external data sources; the code appears intentionally obfuscated without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exceptions with obfuscated names, including one with a __new__ method that conditionally assigns a different class based on a status code. This could be an attempt to obscure control flow or introduce conditional error handling. The exception classes encapsulate messages and status codes, typical for error handling. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious payloads. The obfuscation and dynamic class creation could be used to hide malicious intent, but with no evidence of such activities or external data access, the code appears primarily to be intentionally obfuscated error handling code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated with unusual class naming and dynamic class creation, but it does not contain any clear malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The design appears to be for error handling with obfuscation rather than malicious intent.",
