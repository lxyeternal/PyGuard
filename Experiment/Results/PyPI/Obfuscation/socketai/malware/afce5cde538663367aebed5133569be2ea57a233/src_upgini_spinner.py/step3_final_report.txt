{
  "purpose": "A console-based spinner utility that runs in a separate thread to display animated frames in the terminal.",
  "sources": "Reads internal parameters such as frames list, step_time, and message; no external input.",
  "sinks": "Outputs spinner frames and messages via print() to the console.",
  "flows": "Spinner thread continuously prints frames; main thread can set messages via method; no external data flows or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, but no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple, multithreaded terminal spinner with obfuscated identifiers. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or access sensitive data. The obfuscation appears cosmetic, likely for concealment rather than malicious intent. All threading and output behaviors are standard. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity is present. The high obfuscation score reflects the naming but does not imply malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, obfuscated utility for displaying a terminal spinner. No malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation is cosmetic, and the code functions as intended without security concerns.",
