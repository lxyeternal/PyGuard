  "purpose": "Placeholder functions returning empty lists, likely for interface or scaffolding purposes.",
  "sources": "No external input, environment variables, or data sources; imports from obfuscated local modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication; functions do not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; functions are trivial and contain no logic.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module and class names; functions are empty and do not perform any operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports obfuscated modules and defines two functions that return empty lists, with no external data, network activity, or data processing. The obfuscation suggests concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The functions are placeholders, possibly auto-generated or intentionally obscured. No evidence of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or data leaks is present. The malware score is appropriately zero; obfuscation is high but not malicious; security risk is minimal. The code's benign nature is supported by the lack of external interactions or active logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, likely placeholder or auto-generated with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation warrants cautious review in a broader context but does not justify elevated malware or risk scores.",
