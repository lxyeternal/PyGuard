{
  "purpose": "Download and execute a file from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe' and the filename 'pics.exe'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via subprocess.Popen.",
  "flows": "Download file from URL -> Save as 'pics.exe' -> Execute 'pics.exe'.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names, dynamic process execution, downloading and executing an executable without validation, no checksums or signature verification, hardcoded URL and filename.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions that download a file from a specified URL and save it locally. If the download succeeds, it attempts to run the downloaded file immediately. The URL points to an executable hosted on a public repository, and the filename is hardcoded as 'pics.exe'. The execution is done via subprocess.Popen without any validation or sandboxing, which can be malicious if the downloaded file is harmful. The obfuscated function names and lack of user interaction or validation suggest malicious intent. The code essentially automates the process of downloading and executing an arbitrary executable, typical of malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The script downloads an executable from a remote source and runs it without validation, indicating malicious behavior. The obfuscated naming and automatic execution strongly suggest malicious intent with high risk.",
