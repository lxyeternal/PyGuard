  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, with behaviors typical of malware, including remote code download and execution without validation. The obfuscation and external hosting increase suspicion. The scores (malware: 0.9, obfuscated: 0.8, security risk: 0.9) are justified and consistent with the analysis."
