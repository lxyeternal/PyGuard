      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command triggered conditionally during setup. The behavior aligns with common malware tactics, warranting high security concern. The scores in the reports are appropriate; I would slightly increase the malware and risk scores to reflect the severity more strongly."
