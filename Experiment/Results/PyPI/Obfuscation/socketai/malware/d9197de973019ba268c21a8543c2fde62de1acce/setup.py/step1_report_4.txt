  "anomalies": [
    "Encoded PowerShell command executed silently in the background",
    "Use of subprocess.Popen with no visible output or error handling",
    "Potentially malicious command encoded in Base64, intended to run without user awareness",
    "Try-except blocks suppressing errors, hiding failures"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script begins with importing 'setup' from 'distutils.core' and attempts to import 'subprocess' and 'os'. It then checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists; if not, it runs a PowerShell command encoded in Base64 via subprocess.Popen, with window hidden and no error output. This command appears to be obfuscated, likely designed to execute arbitrary code or establish a backdoor silently. The setup function defines package metadata, but errors during its invocation are suppressed. The use of encoded commands and silent execution indicates malicious intent or at least suspicious activity aimed at executing hidden code on the target system, which could be used for various malicious purposes such as remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious activity, specifically the silent execution of an encoded PowerShell command, which is indicative of malicious intent. The overall behavior suggests an attempt to run hidden code on the system, possibly for malicious purposes. The package setup itself is normal, but the embedded behavior is risky.",
