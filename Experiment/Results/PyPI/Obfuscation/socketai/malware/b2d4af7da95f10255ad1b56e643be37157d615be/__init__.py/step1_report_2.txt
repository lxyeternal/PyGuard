{
  "purpose": "The function appears to be a simple print statement indicating installation or execution confirmation.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "The code only outputs to standard output; no sinks that leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to any sinks; only a direct print statement is executed.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is obfuscated (non-meaningful), but the code itself is very simple and contains no suspicious logic or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a non-descriptive, obfuscated name and calls it immediately, which only results in printing 'installed'. There are no inputs, no external calls, no data manipulation, and no suspicious activity detected. The obfuscated name may be an attempt to hide intent, but functionally, it performs a benign action.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign script that only outputs a message indicating installation. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
