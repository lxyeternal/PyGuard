{
  "purpose": "The code defines and immediately calls a function that prints a confirmation message indicating installation.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are used or read in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs, network communications, or data leaks occur.",
  "flows": "Function is called immediately after definition; no data flows from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears intentionally obfuscated, but the code behavior is straightforward and benign. The function simply prints a static message; no hidden or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single function with a nonsensical, obfuscated name that executes a print statement. The immediate invocation indicates it may be a placeholder or minimal indicator of execution. There are no input sources, no data handling, no external communications, and no suspicious logic or behavior. The obfuscated name alone does not imply malicious intent, especially given the benign action performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign script that outputs a message. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet.",
