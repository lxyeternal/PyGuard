{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function that prints a message indicating installation or presence, and then calls this function.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; only defines and calls a function within the script.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to standard output via the print statement; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the function simply prints a static message.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated or intentionally obscure, which may indicate an attempt to hide intent. The code is minimal and lacks comments or clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a single function with a non-descriptive, obfuscated name, which only outputs a static message 'installed'. It then immediately calls this function. There are no external data inputs, no network activity, no data processing, and no apparent malicious actions. The obfuscated function name could be an attempt to conceal malicious intent, but on its own, the code is benign and simple.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The obfuscated name raises slight suspicion, but the code's actions are harmless and do not pose security threats.",
