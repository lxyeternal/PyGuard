{
  "purpose": "A minimal script indicating installation or execution, likely used as a placeholder or marker.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data sources, or environment variables; only a static print statement.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or external communication.",
  "flows": "Function call from main scope to print statement; no untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; no other unusual code patterns or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that prints 'installed' and calls it immediately. It is trivial, with no inputs, outputs, or external interactions. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but does not imply malicious intent given the benign action. Malware score is 0, security risk is very low (~0.1), and obfuscation is moderate (~0.7). The code appears to serve as a simple indicator or placeholder, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscation as the only minor concern. It does not pose security threats or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
