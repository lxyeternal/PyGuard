  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified by the pattern of obfuscation, stealth, and conditional execution. It warrants further decoding of the command to confirm malicious activity, but current evidence suggests a significant security threat."
