      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscation and irregular parameters. No evidence of malicious activity is present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, but caution is advised if more code or context suggests additional behavior."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code itself is benign but executing 'secretary.py' unvalidated introduces a significant supply chain security risk. The obfuscation and external script execution justify a moderate security concern. The malware score should be set to 0.2, reflecting low inherent maliciousness but acknowledging external risks. The obfuscation score is high at 0.8 due to variable naming. The security risk score should be around 0.6, considering the external script execution without validation."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their assessments. Report 3's suspicion of obfuscation and dynamic execution justifies higher scores, but minor adjustments could improve accuracy. Overall, the supply chain appears low risk, with moderate concern in specific areas pending further code review."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The code is a malicious keylogger exfiltrating sensitive user input via email. It exhibits obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, and covert data transmission, warranting a high malware score and security risk. The behavior is clearly malicious, with no benign justification."
