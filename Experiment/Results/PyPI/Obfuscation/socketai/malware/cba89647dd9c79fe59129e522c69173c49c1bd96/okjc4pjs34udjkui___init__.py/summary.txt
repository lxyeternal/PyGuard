  "malware_score": 0.3,
  "security_risk": 0.5,
  "obfuscated": 0.6,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their assessments. Report 3's suspicion of obfuscation and dynamic execution justifies higher scores, but minor adjustments could improve accuracy. Overall, the supply chain appears low risk, with moderate concern in specific areas pending further code review."
