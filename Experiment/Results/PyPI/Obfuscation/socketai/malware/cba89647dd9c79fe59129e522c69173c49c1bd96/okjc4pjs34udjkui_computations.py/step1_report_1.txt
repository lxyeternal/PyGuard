{
  "purpose": "Execute an external Python script 'secretary.py' and perform a simple arithmetic operation.",
  "sources": "The function receives input parameters 'FePxuRswdBxkFIIuEEoCGlFttnVotmgo' and 'y'.",
  "sinks": "The code runs 'subprocess.Popen' to execute 'secretary.py', which could potentially be malicious if 'secretary.py' contains harmful code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in a multiplication operation; 'secretary.py' is executed as a subprocess independently.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of an external script without validation or sanitization. The filename 'secretary.py' is hardcoded; no direct anomalies beyond that are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Popen' to run external scripts, which can be a vector for malicious activity if 'secretary.py' contains malicious code. The subprocess call does not pass any arguments or data to 'secretary.py', making it run independently. The parameters 'FePxuRswdBxkFIIuEEoCGlFttnVotmgo' and 'y' are used solely for a multiplication operation, with no validation or sanitization. There are no indications of obfuscation or malicious payloads within this code snippet. Overall, the code appears to be a simple utility to run another script and perform a basic calculation, with potential risk associated with the execution of an external script that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes an external script 'secretary.py' without validation, which could be malicious if that script is harmful. The arithmetic operation seems benign and unrelated to the subprocess call. No evidence of obfuscation or direct malicious behavior is present in this snippet, but the subprocess execution poses a potential security risk depending on the content of 'secretary.py'.",
