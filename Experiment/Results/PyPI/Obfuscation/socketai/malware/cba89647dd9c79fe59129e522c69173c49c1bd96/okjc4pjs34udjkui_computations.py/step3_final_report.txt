{
  "purpose": "The code executes an external script 'secretary.py' located in the same directory and performs a simple multiplication of two input parameters, returning the result.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current directory path and the input parameters to perform multiplication.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executes 'secretary.py' without validation, which could lead to execution of malicious code if the script is compromised.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used for multiplication; the external script 'secretary.py' is executed independently, with no data passed to it from the inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated, and the external script is executed unconditionally without validation or sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that runs 'secretary.py' via subprocess.Popen with shell=False, then multiplies two parameters and returns the result. The subprocess execution is unconditional and independent of input validation, which poses a security risk if 'secretary.py' is malicious. Variable obfuscation increases suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The main concern is external script execution without validation, which could be exploited in supply chain attacks. The multiplication operation itself is benign. The obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to conceal intent, but no malicious payload is directly present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign but executing 'secretary.py' unvalidated introduces a significant supply chain security risk. The obfuscation and external script execution justify a moderate security concern. The malware score should be set to 0.2, reflecting low inherent maliciousness but acknowledging external risks. The obfuscation score is high at 0.8 due to variable naming. The security risk score should be around 0.6, considering the external script execution without validation.",
