{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a keylogger that captures keystrokes and sends the logged data via email.",
  "sources": "Input from keyboard events; reading system files; hardcoded email credentials.",
  "sinks": "Writing keystrokes to a file; sending keystroke data over SMTP email connection.",
  "flows": "Keyboard event handlers collect keystrokes -> stored in memory -> written to file -> included in email body -> email sent via SMTP.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded email credentials; variable names suggest obfuscation; use of global variables; attempt to run a keylogger and exfiltrate data via email.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules related to system operations, email, SSL, and keyboard input capture. It defines global variables with obfuscated names and includes functions to log keystrokes, handle special keys (Enter, Backspace, Space), and manage keyboard listener events. The keystrokes are accumulated in a list and then written to a file in a data directory. The email credentials are hardcoded, and the code constructs an email containing the keystrokes, which is then sent to a specified email address using SMTP over SSL. The purpose appears to be to secretly record user keystrokes and send them via email, indicative of malicious intent. The code also contains functions for starting the keylogger and triggering email transmission, fitting the profile of a covert data exfiltration tool.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a keylogger with data exfiltration capabilities via email, using obfuscated variable names and hardcoded credentials. It demonstrates malicious behavior aimed at covertly capturing and transmitting user keystrokes. The presence of hardcoded credentials and keylogging logic indicates a high risk of malicious intent.",
