{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a keylogger that captures keyboard input, stores it, and then emails the collected data to a specified email address.",
  "sources": "Input sources include keyboard input via pynput's keyboard.Listener and reading the __file__ path for saving data.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to a file ('../data/data_file') and sent via SMTP email to a hardcoded email address.",
  "flows": "Keyboard input is captured and stored in memory, then concatenated into a string, written to a file, and sent over email.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded email credentials (password, email addresses), collection of keyboard input (keylogger behavior), and email transmission of potentially sensitive data. The code also uses global variables and obfuscated variable names, indicating possible malicious intent. The script does not validate email server responses or ensure secure handling of credentials.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules for system interaction, email handling, and keyboard input capture. It sets up a keylogger that records keystrokes and stores them in a list. When activated, it captures key events and processes them into a string. The data is saved into a file in a relative directory. Additionally, the script logs the keystrokes via email using hardcoded SMTP credentials, including a password in plaintext. The code structure, especially with obfuscated variable names and the purpose of capturing and transmitting keystrokes, strongly suggests malicious keylogging behavior intended to covertly gather user input and exfiltrate it.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a malicious keylogger that captures user keystrokes, logs them locally, and exfiltrates the data via email using hardcoded credentials. It exhibits typical signs of malicious intent with suspicious obfuscation and sensitive data handling, representing a security threat.",
