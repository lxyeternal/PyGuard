  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on supply chain threats, obfuscation, and code injection.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, imported modules, input functions, network connections, file I/O, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, environment variables, system commands, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network or file I/O, possibly via dynamic code execution or obfuscated control flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, eval/exec usage, obfuscation, complex control flow, inconsistent naming, signs of code obfuscation and potential data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "Benign reports (1-4) show typical data processing patterns with no suspicious activity, consistent scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2). The high-confidence benign assessments align with the absence of anomalies. Report 5 exhibits strong indicators of malicious intent: hardcoded secrets, eval/exec, obfuscation, complex control flow, and potential exfiltration signs, justifying higher scores (malware=0.7, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.8). The evidence supports a high likelihood of malicious behavior, with scores reflecting significant suspicion. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, with minor adjustments to reflect the high suspicion in report 5.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; report 5 indicates high malicious potential due to obfuscation and unsafe practices. The scores are appropriate, with a slightly elevated malware score (0.7) and risk (0.8) for report 5, aligning with the suspicious indicators identified.",
