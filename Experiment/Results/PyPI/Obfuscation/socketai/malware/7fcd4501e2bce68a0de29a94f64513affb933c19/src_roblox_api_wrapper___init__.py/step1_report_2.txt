  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility script for processing data, possibly involving network communication or data handling, based on typical patterns of such scripts.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are likely from function parameters, user input, or external files. Specific sources are not explicitly shown in the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission functions, file writing, or data output methods, which could be exploited if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs), possibly through intermediate processing steps. Exact flow paths are not detailed in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are visible. The code does not contain obfuscated patterns or unnecessary dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code provided lacks specific details, making a precise analysis difficult. There are no apparent malicious functions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication with suspicious domains. Usage of standard libraries and typical data handling suggests normal behavior. Without further context or additional code, no malicious indicators are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the given code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard data processing with no hardcoded secrets or malicious intent visible.",
