{
  "purpose": "Function definition with parameters named user, recipient, and message, but no implementation.",
  "sources": "Parameters user, recipient, message are potential data sources.",
  "sinks": "No code within the function; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No executable code, so no source-to-sink data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Function body is empty (pass statement); no operations or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a descriptive name and parameters that suggest messaging or communication functionality. However, the function body contains only a 'pass' statement, indicating it performs no actions, does not process input, and contains no malicious code or behavior. The parameter names alone are not suspicious, and there are no external calls or embedded logic. No anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a placeholder function with no executable logic or malicious intent. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior based solely on this fragment.",
