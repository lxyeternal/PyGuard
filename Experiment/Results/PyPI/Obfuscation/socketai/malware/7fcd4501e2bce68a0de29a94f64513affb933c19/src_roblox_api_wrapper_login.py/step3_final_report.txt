  "purpose": "Placeholder functions with obfuscated names, no implementation or active logic.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (cookie, username, password), but unused; no data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or external interactions; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; functions are empty.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names, but no code execution, data leakage, or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two empty functions with obfuscated names, accepting parameters but not utilizing them. There is no logic, data processing, or external calls. The obfuscation may be a tactic to hide intent, but without implementation, suspicion remains low. Scores for malware and security risk are appropriately set to zero or near-zero, reflecting the inert nature of the code. High obfuscation scores are justified due to the naming. Confidence in benign assessment is high, given the lack of activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as placeholder or stub functions with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats in this fragment. Obfuscation warrants monitoring if integrated into larger codebases, but as provided, the security risk is negligible.",
