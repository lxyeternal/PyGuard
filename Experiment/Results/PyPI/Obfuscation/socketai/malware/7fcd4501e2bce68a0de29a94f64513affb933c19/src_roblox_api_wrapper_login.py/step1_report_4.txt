  "purpose": "Placeholder functions with no implementation, potentially designed for future use or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "No actual data reading or input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Function names are obfuscated and do not provide meaningful context; functions are empty, which could indicate intent to hide behavior or placeholder code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two empty functions with obfuscated names, neither performing any operations nor containing any code that reads input, processes data, or writes output. The lack of implementation prevents any analysis of malicious behavior or security issues. Obfuscated naming may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but without code inside, there is no evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be placeholder or obfuscated functions with no actual logic. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
