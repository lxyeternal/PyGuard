{
  "purpose": "The functions are placeholders with no implementation, indicating they are intended to handle cookies and user credentials.",
  "sources": "No actual data reading or input handling present; function parameters are not used within the functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; the functions are empty and do not perform any operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows since functions do not execute any code or process inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined with obfuscated names but contain no logic, code, or data handling; no unusual or malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two empty function definitions with obfuscated names. There are no imports, no code execution, no data processing, and no external interactions. The lack of implementation suggests these are placeholders or intentionally empty functions. No suspicious behaviors, such as data leaks, malicious commands, or backdoors, are evident. The code does not perform any operations that could pose a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be placeholder functions with obfuscated names, serving no active purpose or malicious intent.",
