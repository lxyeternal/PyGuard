{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'pqmkitovwua91fff' and attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current directory state with 'os.path.exists', and potentially executes a subprocess with 'subprocess.Popen' which contains an encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command with encoded content, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if the encoded command is malicious.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' directory does not exist, the code runs the encoded PowerShell command via subprocess, which could execute malicious instructions depending on the decoded payload.",
  "anomalies": "The use of an encoded PowerShell command within a subprocess.Popen, combined with checking for a directory before executing, is suspicious. The encoded string likely contains obfuscated code, and the try-except blocks suppress errors silently, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup from distutils.core to prepare package installation metadata. Before that, it attempts to run a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64, triggered only if the 'tahg' directory is absent. The encoded command likely performs some malicious activity, such as downloading or executing additional payloads. The use of encoded commands and silent error handling suggests an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The overall structure indicates the code is intended to silently execute potentially harmful code during package setup, which is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by executing an obfuscated PowerShell command during setup, possibly to install or run malicious payloads. The presence of encoded commands and silent error handling increases suspicion, indicating a probable supply chain attack vector.",
