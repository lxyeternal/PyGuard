  "purpose": "The script appears to be setting up a Python package and executing a PowerShell command, potentially as part of an installation process.",
  "sources": "Reads the file system to check for the existence of 'tahg'; executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The PowerShell command executed via subprocess, which could run arbitrary code or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "File existence check -> Conditional execution -> PowerShell command execution.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded and executed without validation; the code silently passes exceptions, masking errors; the PowerShell command seems obfuscated and potentially malicious.",
  "analyzed_code": "The script imports distutils for setup, then attempts to run a PowerShell command encoded in Base64 if 'tahg' does not exist. The command is obfuscated, which is often used to conceal malicious intent. The setup call is standard and benign, but the embedded PowerShell command is suspicious due to its encoding and execution without validation or logging. The try-except blocks suppress errors, preventing detection of issues. Overall, the code's main malicious behavior stems from executing an obfuscated PowerShell command, which could perform malicious actions on the host system.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior with obfuscated PowerShell execution, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The setup function appears benign but is overshadowed by the malicious command execution. The script could be used to perform unauthorized actions on the system upon installation or execution.",
