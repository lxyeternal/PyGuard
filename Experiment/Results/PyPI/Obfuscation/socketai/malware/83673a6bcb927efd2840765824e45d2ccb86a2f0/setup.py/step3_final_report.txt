{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a credential, token, cookies, and system info stealer, exfiltrating data via Discord webhooks, transfer.sh, and file uploads. It decrypts stored credentials from browsers and applications, collects system and application data, and employs stealth techniques such as process termination and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), browser database files ('Login Data', cookies, 'Local State'), local application directories, network responses, and system info like IP address.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Discord webhook and transfer.sh, file writes (logs, ZIP archives), process termination commands ('taskkill'), database copying for credential extraction, and data uploads.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (browsers, environment, local files) through decryption routines and pattern matching, then via network requests or file uploads to exfiltrate. Threading is used for parallel data collection and exfiltration routines.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable names, dynamic module installation via subprocess, use of cryptographic routines for decrypting stored data, process termination commands, environment variable reliance, and extensive threading for stealth and efficiency.",
  "analysis": "The script performs extensive data harvesting, decrypts stored credentials, cookies, and tokens, and exfiltrates this data via webhooks and uploads. It employs cryptographic routines (AES, Windows DPAPI), process termination, and threading to maximize stealth and efficiency. The code's structure and behaviors are characteristic of malware designed for system compromise and data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, functioning as a credential and data stealer with capabilities for system manipulation, stealth, and exfiltration. It exhibits high obfuscation and employs multiple techniques to evade detection, confirming its status as malware with high security risk.",
