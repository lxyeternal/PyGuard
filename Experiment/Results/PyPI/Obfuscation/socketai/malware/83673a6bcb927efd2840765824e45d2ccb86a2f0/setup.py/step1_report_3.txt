{
  "purpose": "The script appears to perform a comprehensive data collection and exfiltration, including retrieving system information, user credentials, cookies, browser data, and tokens from various applications, then uploads and reports this data via Discord webhooks and transfer services. It also installs dependencies, modifies files, and executes malicious activities such as process killing and zipping files.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), system files (browser storage, login data, cookies), network requests to URLs, files from user directories, and process lists.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Discord webhooks and transfer.sh, file writes (logs, zip files, temp files), subprocess calls to kill processes, and data uploads to external services.",
  "flows": "Extracts tokens and credentials from local files → processes and decodes encrypted data → uploads sensitive info to webhooks and transfer sites → runs threading functions to scan directories and steal cookies, passwords, tokens → exfiltrates data via HTTP POST requests and uploads.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic dependency installation, decoding and decrypting encrypted data, multiple threads for simultaneous data collection, usage of base64 and crypt32 APIs for decryption, and inclusion of Discord webhooks for remote exfiltration. The code manipulates browser data, logs, cookies, and system info. Several functions appear designed for stealth and data theft.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by importing modules, some of which are installed dynamically if missing, indicating an attempt to run in environments where dependencies might be missing. It defines URLs for webhooks and functions for system info retrieval, encryption/decryption, and data collection from browsers and applications. Several functions extract sensitive data: tokens, cookies, login credentials, and system info, decrypt encrypted keys, and process files. It performs network communication to send data to Discord webhooks, upload files to transfer.sh, and hide activities in ZIP archives. Multithreading is used extensively to gather data from multiple sources concurrently, such as browsers, cookies, and credentials. The code also kills processes related to known browsers and crypto wallets, then zips and exfiltrates their data. The setup function at the end suggests repackaging or setup, but the main activities indicate malicious intent, mainly data theft, system compromise, and covert exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This script is highly suspicious and likely malicious, functioning as a stealer that gathers user credentials, cookies, tokens, and system information, then exfiltrates this data via Discord webhooks and file upload services. Its obfuscated variable names, encrypted data handling, multi-threaded data collection, and process-killing activities strongly indicate malicious behavior. It does not contain any legitimate or benign functionality, and its purpose aligns with malware or information-stealing operations.",
