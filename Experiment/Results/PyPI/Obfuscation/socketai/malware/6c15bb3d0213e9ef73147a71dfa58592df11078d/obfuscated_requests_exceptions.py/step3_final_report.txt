{
  "purpose": "Define exception classes for HTTP errors with obfuscated attribute names, likely part of an HTTP library.",
  "sources": "Class attribute assignments containing obfuscated strings, imports, class initializers.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or external data handling; attributes are unused and do not lead to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "No active data flow from sources to sinks; attributes are assigned but not utilized in operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated attribute names and strings that are unused; superficial obfuscation without functional impact.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various HTTP-related exceptions, with obfuscated attribute names assigned to arbitrary strings. These attributes are not used elsewhere, nor do they influence program behavior. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for internal or proprietary reasons, but does not demonstrate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations are evident. The low malware score (0) aligns with the absence of malicious behavior, while the obfuscated attribute names justify a higher obfuscation score (~0.75). The overall security risk remains low (~0.2-0.3), primarily due to obfuscation but without active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception hierarchy with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage is present. The obfuscation does not appear to serve malicious purposes based solely on this fragment. Scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
