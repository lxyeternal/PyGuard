  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, build, author, license, and copyright information.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; standard metadata declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string variable assignments providing package metadata. No input/output handling, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive operations are present. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The use of Unicode characters in __cake__ is benign and decorative. Overall, this code appears to be standard metadata without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely informational metadata for the 'requests' package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.",
