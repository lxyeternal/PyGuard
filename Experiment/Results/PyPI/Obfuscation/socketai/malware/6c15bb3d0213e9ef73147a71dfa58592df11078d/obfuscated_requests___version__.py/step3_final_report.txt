  "sources": "Static variable assignments defining package metadata; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "None; static data assignment without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Unicode emojis in __cake__, which is benign and decorative; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with no dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or obfuscation. Unicode emojis are harmless. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No anomalies or security concerns are present. The code is straightforward and typical for package metadata declarations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign package metadata with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
