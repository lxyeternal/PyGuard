  "purpose": "This code defines metadata attributes for the 'requests' Python package, including version, author, license, and description.",
  "sources": "These are static string assignments, with no input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists between sources and sinks; the code simply sets module-level variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and standard for package metadata; no unusual or suspicious elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of simple attribute assignments providing package metadata information. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated or complex code structures. All attributes are hardcoded strings or numbers. There are no apparent security risks, malicious behavior, or anomalies. The metadata appears typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, providing standard package metadata with no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
