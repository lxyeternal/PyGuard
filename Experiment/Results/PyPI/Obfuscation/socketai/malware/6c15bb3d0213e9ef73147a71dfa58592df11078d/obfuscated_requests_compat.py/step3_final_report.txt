  "purpose": "Environment setup and compatibility handling for JSON, URL parsing, and cookies across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Module imports, version detection, and type redefinitions for compatibility.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, external output, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements and variable definitions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Redefinition of 'str' and 'bytes' for compatibility; no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard environment setup, importing modules with fallbacks for compatibility between Python 2 and 3. It includes version detection and type aliasing, which are common practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not process untrusted data, connect to external servers, or contain hidden backdoors. All signals indicate benign boilerplate code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup module for cross-version compatibility with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.",
