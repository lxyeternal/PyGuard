{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up environment compatibility and import various standard libraries for data handling, JSON processing, and URL parsing, likely as part of a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (chardet, charset_normalizer, sys, simplejson/json, collections, http, io, urllib.request, urllib.parse).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data manipulation are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports and environment checks, establishing compatibility, do not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation observed. Code is typical setup for cross-version compatibility and module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code performs conditional imports based on availability and Python version detection. It sets up JSON handling with fallback, imports standard libraries for URL and cookie management, and defines some type aliases. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources is present. No signs of malicious behavior or suspicious patterns in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard setup code for cross-version compatibility and library imports, with no indication of malicious activity or security risks.",
