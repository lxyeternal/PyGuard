{
  "purpose": "The code sets up environment compatibility, imports necessary modules, and defines some type aliases for use in a larger Python application.",
  "sources": "Module imports (chardet, charset_normalizer, json, sys, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request). No user input or external data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network, file, or system commands are present; no untrusted data handling is visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observed; code mainly performs imports and environment checks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard compatibility code for different Python versions. No suspicious or unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment setup, conditional imports, and defines compatibility aliases, typical for cross-version Python modules. No indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks. All imports are from standard or well-known libraries with no evident malicious code. The code appears to be the initial setup segment of a larger project. No dynamic execution or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard environment setup with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is unlikely to be malicious and is typical boilerplate code for ensuring compatibility across Python versions.",
