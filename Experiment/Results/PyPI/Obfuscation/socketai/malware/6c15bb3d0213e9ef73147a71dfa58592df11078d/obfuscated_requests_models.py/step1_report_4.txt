{
  "purpose": "This module provides classes and functions for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses using the Requests library in Python.",
  "sources": "Code reads request parameters, headers, cookies, JSON content, response status codes, headers (like 'link'), and response content.",
  "sinks": "Code may write or process request data, response content, headers, and raise exceptions based on response status. Notably, the 'raise_for_status' method raises exceptions based on response status codes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (request parameters, headers, cookies, JSON, URL, auth) into request objects; responses are processed through status code checks, content decoding, and JSON parsing; exceptions are raised if needed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No use of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual variables. The code follows typical request/response handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages HTTP request construction, response processing, and error handling. It includes functions for decoding response content, parsing headers, and raising exceptions on error status codes. The only notable point is the handling of response encoding and JSON decoding, which appears standard and secure. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft are evident. The code uses standard libraries and methods without any anomalies or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of HTTP request and response handling in the Requests library. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks are present. It performs typical tasks expected of such a module with no suspicious features.",
