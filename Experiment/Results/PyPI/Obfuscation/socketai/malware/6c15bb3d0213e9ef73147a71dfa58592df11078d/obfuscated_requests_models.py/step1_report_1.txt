{
  "purpose": "This module provides classes and functions for constructing, preparing, sending, and handling HTTP requests and responses using the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input sources include request parameters such as URL, headers, files, data, JSON payloads, cookies, and hooks. Data is read from function parameters and object attributes like headers and content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission of request data, headers, and cookies; response handling where content is read or decoded; raising exceptions; and connection management. These are typical in HTTP request/response processing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., URL, headers, data) into request objects, which are then prepared and sent over the network. Response data flows back into content properties, decoding routines, and error handling. No untrusted data appears to flow directly into system-level operations outside HTTP processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard implementation of an HTTP request/response handler with no obvious malicious or unusual code constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No suspicious network connections or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages HTTP request preparation, response decoding, error handling, and connection management. It uses common patterns for network I/O and JSON decoding. No hardcoded credentials or potentially malicious behavior are present. The code does not execute untrusted code, send data to unknown domains, or perform any actions that would indicate supply chain sabotage or malware. The focus is on safe handling of HTTP communication.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard part of the Requests library handling HTTP interactions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It functions as expected for a network communication module with no suspicious anomalies.",
