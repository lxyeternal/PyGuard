{
  "purpose": "Standard HTTP request/response handling within the requests library, including request preparation, response decoding, error handling, and header parsing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as method, url, headers, files, data, json, params, auth, cookies, hooks; response content and headers.",
  "sinks": "Response content decoding, JSON parsing, error raising, header parsing, connection management.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into request construction; response content flows into decoding and JSON parsing; errors and headers are processed for response handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code is straightforward and adheres to standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical HTTP client operations: preparing requests, decoding responses, handling errors, and parsing headers. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. The JSON decoding is standard, with error handling that does not indicate malicious intent. The connection management and header parsing follow expected patterns. Overall, the code is a benign, well-structured component of the requests library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of HTTP request handling with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this benign nature.",
