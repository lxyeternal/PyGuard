{
  "purpose": "To output the filesystem path to the current CA bundle used by the certifi library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi library by importing and calling the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is used; the code only outputs a static resource location.",
  "flows": "The code calls 'where()' to retrieve a file path and prints it; no data flows from external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code simply retrieves and prints a resource path.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' library, which provides the location of the trusted CA bundle. When executed as a script, it prints this path to the console. There are no inputs from external sources, no data processing, and no suspicious or malicious operations. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to SSL/TLS certificate verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and harmless, designed solely to output the location of the certifi CA bundle. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
