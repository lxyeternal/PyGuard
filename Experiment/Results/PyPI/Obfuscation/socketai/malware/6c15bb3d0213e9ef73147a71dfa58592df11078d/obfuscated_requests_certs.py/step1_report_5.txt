{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to output the file path of the system's trusted CA bundle using the certifi library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system's CA bundle location via the 'where' function from certifi.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could be exploited or cause data leaks; it only prints a value.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the 'where()' function call to the print statement; no external or untrusted input influences the flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code constructs. The code uses standard library functions in a straightforward manner.",
  "analysis": "The code imports certifi's 'where' function, which provides the path to the trusted CA bundle. It then prints this path. There are no inputs from external sources, no data manipulation, and no suspicious behavior. The code performs a simple, benign operation commonly used for validation or informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, straightforward, and does not contain malicious intent. It simply outputs the system's trusted CA bundle location with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
