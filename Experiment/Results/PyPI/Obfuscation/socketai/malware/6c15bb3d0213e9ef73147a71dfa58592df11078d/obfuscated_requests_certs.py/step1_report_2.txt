{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to output the location of the trusted CA bundle used by the 'certifi' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'where' function from the 'certifi' library, which provides the path to the CA bundle.",
  "sinks": "The output of the program is printed to standard output; no direct sink that causes data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function retrieves the CA bundle path and the output is printed; no untrusted input flows into the system or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward usage of a well-known library function with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from the 'certifi' library, then, when run as the main program, prints the path to the CA certificates bundle. The code is minimal, using standard library functions without any obfuscation or suspicious patterns. There are no inputs from external untrusted sources, no sensitive data handling, and no network or file manipulation beyond reading a trusted CA bundle path. It appears to serve a debugging or informational purpose without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply outputs the location of the CA bundle used by 'certifi'.",
