{
  "purpose": "The script retrieves and prints the path to the CA bundle file used by the 'certifi' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'where' function from the 'certifi' library, which provides the path to trusted CA certificates.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' function outputs data to the console; no data sinks to external systems are involved.",
  "flows": "The code calls 'where()' to get the CA bundle path and then prints it to the standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi', then, if executed directly, prints the location of the CA bundle file. This is a benign operation typically used for debugging or informational purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, benign task of displaying the location of the certificate bundle used by 'certifi'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code.",
