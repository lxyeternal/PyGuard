  "purpose": "Perform dependency validation, version checks, cryptography validation, and warning setup for environment compatibility in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports of version strings from charset_normalizer, chardet, cryptography; version assertions; environment detection (ssl, cryptography).",
  "sinks": "Assertions and version parsing could cause process termination if inputs are manipulated, but no direct data leaks or malicious data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Version strings are read from imported modules; assertions validate versions; warnings are issued based on environment checks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for version validation could be exploited to cause denial of service if version strings are maliciously crafted, but this is standard practice in dependency validation routines.",
  "analysis": "The code performs routine dependency and environment validation, including version checks and cryptography validation. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Assertions are used for validation, which is common but could be exploited in theory. No data leaks or malicious payloads are detected. The overall purpose is environment setup and dependency validation, with low security risk and no malware detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency validation routine with no malicious intent or behavior. The use of assertions, while potentially exploitable, is typical for such validation. No signs of obfuscation or malware are present. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
