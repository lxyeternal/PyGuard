{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and configures dependencies and compatibility checks for the urllib3 library and related modules, including version validation, cryptography checks, and warning configurations.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version checks, cryptography version retrieval, and compatibility assertions.",
  "sinks": "Warnings issued through warnings.warn(), potential exception handling, and import hooks. No direct data output or network communication in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import and version validation source flows lead to warnings or exception handling as sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code performs standard dependency checks and warning configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency validation, including version assertions and cryptography checks, with proper exception handling. It conditionally loads modules, injects cryptography support if needed, and configures warnings. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful payloads. The code’s purpose appears solely to ensure dependency compatibility and proper warning setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a routine setup and validation script for dependencies within a Python package. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The code maintains good practices and does not exhibit malware or malicious behavior.",
