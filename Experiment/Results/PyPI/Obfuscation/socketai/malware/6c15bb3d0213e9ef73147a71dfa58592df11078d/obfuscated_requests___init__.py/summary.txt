  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency validation routine with no malicious intent or behavior. The use of assertions, while potentially exploitable, is typical for such validation. No signs of obfuscation or malware are present. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose."
