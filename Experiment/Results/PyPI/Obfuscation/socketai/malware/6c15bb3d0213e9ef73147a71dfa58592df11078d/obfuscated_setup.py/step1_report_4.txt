{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup or installation script for a Python package, including dependency management, version checks, and post-installation routines. It also contains code that downloads and executes remote files, which could be used maliciously.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the reading of '__version__.py' file for version info, 'README.md' for package description, and network requests to specific URLs for downloading files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing files ('local_copy.txt', 'local_b.txt'), executing system commands via subprocess (e.g., moving and deleting files, executing 'cmd /c' commands), and network requests that fetch remote content.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data flows from network requests (requests.get) to file writes, and from these files being executed or moved into system commands via subprocess. Data from network responses are stored locally and then used in command execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes malicious-looking activities such as downloading remote files, executing system commands with shell=True, moving files into batch scripts, and attempting to run downloaded files as batch scripts. It also installs dependencies dynamically if missing, and contains obfuscated variable names. The URL 'http://52.14.229.35:1122' is suspicious and used multiple times for downloads. The code performs actions that could be used for persistence, remote control, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment checks and installs dependencies. It then executes a series of commands on Windows systems that involve downloading files from remote servers, writing them locally, and executing them via cmd /c commands. The code uses subprocess with shell=True, which is insecure and can lead to command injection. The URLs used for downloading are suspicious and could serve malicious payloads. The code attempts to run commands that could modify or delete files and execute potentially malicious scripts. The obfuscated variable names and indirect file execution are common in malicious scripts. The script's behavior—downloading external content, executing it, and manipulating system files—is indicative of malicious activity, potentially aiming for persistence or payload execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious characteristics, including remote payload download, execution of system commands, and obfuscated variable names. It is highly suspicious and likely malicious. The script could be used for system compromise, persistence, or data theft. It should be flagged and removed from any environment. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the presence of malicious patterns and suspicious URL activity.",
