{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script that manages dependencies and package metadata but contains embedded malicious activities, including remote payload downloads, execution of system commands, privilege checks, obfuscation, and system modifications.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '__version__.py', dependency lists, and network requests to hardcoded IP addresses for payload downloads.",
  "sinks": "Downloading files from IP '52.14.229.35:1122', writing to disk ('local_copy.txt', 'local_b.txt'), executing batch scripts via 'cmd /c', and privilege verification through 'net session'.",
  "flows": "Source: remote IP requests and version info; Sink: downloaded files written and executed via subprocess; flow: remote payload download -> file write -> execution -> system modification and privilege check.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import from 'setuptools' with a nonsensical module name, use of broad exception handling hiding errors, remote IPs for payloads, downloading and executing code from external sources, and Windows-specific code performing system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code begins as a typical setup script but includes obfuscated imports and variable names. It performs a version check and dependency setup. In Windows environments, it retrieves the temp directory, installs 'requests' if missing, then downloads payloads from specific IPs, saving them as batch files, and executes them via subprocess. It also checks for admin privileges using 'net session'. The broad exception handling suppresses errors, hiding failures. The network activity and remote code execution are characteristic of malware. The obfuscation and external IPs used for payload delivery strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including remote payload downloads, execution, privilege checks, and obfuscation. It should be classified as highly malicious, posing a severe security risk, and should be removed from any environment. The scores are consistent with the observed behavior, with malware and risk scores set to 1.0, and obfuscation around 0.8.",
