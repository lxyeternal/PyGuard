  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The report correctly identifies the code as cookie management utilities, with data flowing from request/response objects into cookie jars, and no external system interactions.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behaviors or obfuscation detected. The mention of an obfuscated attribute in `CookieConflictError` is noted but deemed benign.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report concludes no malicious activity, with high confidence (1).  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, which seems reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, with standard cookie handling, no external network activity.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The only unusual aspect is the obfuscated attribute in `CookieConflictError`, but it’s used internally and does not indicate malicious intent.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, low risk, high confidence (0.9).  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.1, obfuscated = 0.2, consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Again, standard cookie management, no external communication.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The obfuscated attribute in `CookieConflictError` is noted but not malicious.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, low risk, confidence 0.9.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0.2, risk = 0.2.  \n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard cookie handling, no network activity.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The use of a non-standard string in `CookieConflictError` is benign.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, minimal risk, confidence 0.9.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.2, obfuscated = 0.  \n\n**Assessment:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Same pattern—cookie management without network activity.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The only unusual element is the string in `CookieConflictError`, which is benign.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, low risk, confidence 0.9.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.2, obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code’s behavior—no network, no code injection, no data exfiltration, no malicious logic.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Slightly higher in some reports (up to 0.2), due to the unusual attribute name in `CookieConflictError`. This is not malicious but could be considered obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — the code is standard cookie management code with no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2 — the attribute name in `CookieConflictError` is somewhat obfuscated but not malicious.  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minimal risk, primarily due to potential obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and the scores are reasonable. No evidence of malware or malicious intent exists. The only minor anomaly is the obfuscated attribute name, which does not impact security.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware score at 0.  \n- Keep obfuscated at 0.2, considering the attribute name.  \n- Keep security risk at 0.2.\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, standard cookie handling logic with no malicious behavior detected.**",
