{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for managing HTTP cookies, including creation, extraction, removal, and merging of cookies, primarily used in HTTP request/response handling.",
  "sources": "Code reads request URLs, request headers, and response headers; cookie data from CookieJar objects.",
  "sinks": "Cookie manipulation functions (set, delete, update) and request header modifications; no direct data leakage or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Cookies are read from requests and responses, then stored, updated, or deleted via CookieJar methods; no data flows to external systems or network communications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Some code constructs (e.g., importing dummy_threading) appear standard for fallback, not suspicious. The presence of obfuscated variable names in exceptions is benign. The class CookieConflictError has a non-standard attribute name but no malicious intent; it seems to serve as an internal error class.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly manages cookies in a standard way, including creating cookies, converting Morsel objects, extracting cookies from responses, and merging cookie jars. No suspicious network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. All functions perform expected cookie handling tasks with safe implementations. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe practices are present. The code's structure, naming, and logic appear normal and consistent with typical cookie management libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cookie management functions with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe for use within an HTTP request/response context.",
