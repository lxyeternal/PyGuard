  "purpose": "Provides cookie management utilities, including cookie jar handling, cookie creation, and request/response cookie extraction.",
  "sources": "Request headers, response headers, cookie dictionaries, cookie objects, request objects",
  "sinks": "Cookie jar modifications, cookie extraction, cookie header generation",
  "flows": "Input data from request/response headers or dicts into cookie jar objects, with no external network activity",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated attribute name in CookieConflictError class ('FKvbiYkgbETZXVPdMuBvLfuwFfjuPrch'), which appears benign",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie handling functions, including cookie creation, extraction, removal, and cookie jar management. No network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns are present. The obfuscated attribute in CookieConflictError is used internally as a string identifier and does not indicate malicious intent. The code relies on standard libraries and practices, with no suspicious logic or obfuscation techniques beyond a benign attribute name. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with safe cookie management utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign cookie management library with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The minor obfuscation in an internal class attribute does not impact security. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0.2 due to the attribute name, and the overall security risk is low at 0.2.",
