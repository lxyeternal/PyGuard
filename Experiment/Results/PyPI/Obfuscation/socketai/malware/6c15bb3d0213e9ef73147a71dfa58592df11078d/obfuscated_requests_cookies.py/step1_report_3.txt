  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for handling HTTP cookies, including creating, managing, extracting, and merging cookies within a request/response context.",
  "sources": "The code reads cookie data from request headers, response headers, and cookie jars. It also processes cookie attributes such as max-age and expires from cookie morsels.",
  "sinks": "Cookie extraction, header manipulation, and cookie jar updates could be influenced by untrusted sources, but these are standard behaviors. No external network or sensitive data leakage functions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from request headers or cookie dictionaries into cookie objects, which are stored in cookie jars. Cookies are created, retrieved, or deleted based on input data. No external or untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to code execution or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to follow standard cookie management procedures without suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, unusual obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present. The variable name 'cNsxgGPcsjPNfRsSbbLqwOIANeQMztmf' is an obfuscated string assigned to an error class but used solely as a class attribute, which does not appear malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides well-structured cookie management functions, including creating cookies, converting morsels to cookies, merging cookies, and extracting cookies from requests and responses. It handles cookie attributes with typical logic and does not include network calls, eval, exec, or other suspicious patterns. The use of standard libraries and no dynamic code execution indicates a benign intent. The only unusual element is an obfuscated class attribute name, which is not inherently malicious but might suggest intentional concealment. Overall, it appears to be standard cookie handling code with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cookie utilities with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscated attribute name is not indicative of malicious behavior but is a minor anomaly. The overall security risk is very low.",
