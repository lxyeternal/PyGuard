{
  "purpose": "The code performs package setup and configuration, but contains a malicious Windows-specific block that downloads and executes remote files from hardcoded IP addresses, indicating potential malware activity.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET requests to hardcoded IP addresses, reading remote content, subprocess calls executing downloaded files, system directory changes, and privilege checks.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen with shell=True executing downloaded files, writing files to system directories, and deleting temporary files, enabling remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Remote URL fetch -> Save to local file -> Execute via subprocess -> Cleanup files -> Potential backdoor or malicious payload execution.",
  "anomalies": "Remote IP addresses used for payloads, execution of remote content without validation, use of shell=True in subprocess, manipulation of system directories, and privilege checks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks but contains a suspicious Windows-specific section that downloads files from hardcoded IPs and executes them via subprocess with shell=True, which is highly risky. It installs dependencies silently, changes directories to system temp, and runs remote scripts or binaries, indicating malicious intent. The code does not validate downloaded content, increasing the risk of executing malicious payloads. The pattern aligns with remote code execution or backdoor installation typical of supply chain attacks. The rest of the code appears benign, but the malicious block is clear and active.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious activity, specifically remote payload download and execution, characteristic of malware or supply chain sabotage. The high malware score (0.9), zero obfuscation, and maximum security risk (1) are justified based on the observed behavior.",
