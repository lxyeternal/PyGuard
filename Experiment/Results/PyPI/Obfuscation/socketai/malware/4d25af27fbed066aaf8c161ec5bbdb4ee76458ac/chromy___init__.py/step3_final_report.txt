  "purpose": "This code imports the 'webdiv' component from the 'chromy.sitediv' module, likely for use in a larger application or webpage rendering.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports a module component.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code does not handle data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present in this snippet; it only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. It does not perform any network activity, data processing, or external communication. The import is standard and benign. Given the lack of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code, the risk and malware scores should remain at zero. The confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code snippet.",
