{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather information about Discord tokens stored locally on the user's system and then send this information to specified Discord webhooks.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA), local files in specific directories related to Discord and browsers, and local storage leveldb files.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to external URLs via HTTP POST requests to Discord webhook URLs, including potentially sensitive information like tokens.",
  "flows": "Tokens are extracted from local files and environment variables, then formatted and transmitted over the network to external webhook URLs.",
  "anomalies": "The code searches for pattern matches resembling Discord tokens and exfiltrates them without user consent, and the code contains obfuscated variable names. The URL endpoints are hardcoded webhook URLs, and the code operates silently with exception suppression.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to locate Discord tokens stored on the local system by searching in typical directories used by Discord and browsers. It extracts token-like patterns using regex and then constructs a message containing the found tokens. This message is sent anonymously to external webhook URLs, which could be used maliciously for data theft or unauthorized access. The obfuscated variable names and silent exception handling indicate an intent to hide malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate functions beyond token theft, aligning with malicious behavior patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious, functioning as a token stealer (likely malware) that exfiltrates sensitive Discord tokens to external servers. Its structure, obfuscation, and network activity strongly suggest malicious intent.",
