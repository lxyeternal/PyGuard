  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to extract Discord tokens from user directories and send them to external servers. It employs obfuscation and stealth techniques typical of malware. The high malware score (1.0), obfuscation score (~0.8), and security risk (~1.0) are justified based on its behavior."
