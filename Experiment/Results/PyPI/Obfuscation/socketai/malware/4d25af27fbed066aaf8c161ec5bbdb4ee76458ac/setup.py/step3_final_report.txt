{
  "purpose": "The code scans user directories for Discord tokens and exfiltrates them via webhooks.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for directory paths, scans files with extensions .log and .ldb, and reads their contents.",
  "sinks": "Sends extracted tokens to hardcoded webhook URLs over HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Directory paths -> File reading -> Regex matching for tokens -> Sending tokens via HTTP POST to webhooks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, hardcoded webhook URLs, silent exception handling during network requests, automatic execution on import, access to multiple user directories and browsers without user notification.",
  "analysis": "The code locates Discord tokens stored in local directories by matching specific regex patterns. It then exfiltrates these tokens to attacker-controlled webhooks without user consent. Obfuscated variable names and silent network request handling suggest an intent to hide malicious activity. The code operates automatically, targeting multiple browsers and Discord data folders, indicating a credential-stealing malware. The use of hardcoded webhooks and environment variables for directory paths further supports malicious intent. The logic is consistent with typical credential stealer malware, with no benign functionality present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to extract Discord tokens from user directories and send them to external servers. It employs obfuscation and stealth techniques typical of malware. The high malware score (1.0), obfuscation score (~0.8), and security risk (~1.0) are justified based on its behavior.",
