  "purpose": "Retrieve the system's public IP address via an external API call.",
  "sources": "The method calls requests.get(\"https://api.ipify.org/\").text to fetch data from the external API.",
  "sinks": "Returns the fetched IP address directly; no further processing or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Source: requests.get() response; Sink: return statement providing the IP address.",
  "anomalies": "Class and method names are obfuscated; no other unusual code patterns or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward external API request to obtain the public IP address. Obfuscation of class and method names is present but does not imply malicious intent. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The response is simply returned, with no further processing or suspicious network activity. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. Scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a simple purpose of fetching the public IP address. Obfuscation is present but not malicious. The malware score should be 0, and the security risk score should be very low (~0.1-0.2). The obfuscation score remains high (~0.7) due to naming but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
