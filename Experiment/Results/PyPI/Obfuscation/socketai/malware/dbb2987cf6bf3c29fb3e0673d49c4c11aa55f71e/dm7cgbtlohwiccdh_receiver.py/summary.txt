  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a simple purpose of fetching the public IP address. Obfuscation is present but not malicious. The malware score should be 0, and the security risk score should be very low (~0.1-0.2). The obfuscation score remains high (~0.7) due to naming but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
