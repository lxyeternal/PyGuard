  "purpose": "Retrieve and print the IP address associated with the IP 8.8.8.8 using an external API.",
  "sources": "The line 'requests.get(\"https://ipapi.co/8.8.8.8/json/\").json()' which reads data from an external API.",
  "sinks": "The print statement that outputs the 'ip' field from the API response.",
  "flows": "The external API response (source) flows into the JSON parsing, then the 'ip' field is printed to the console.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a seemingly random function name, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code. No unusual or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the requests library and defines a function with an obscure name. Inside, it makes an HTTP GET request to ipapi.co to retrieve geolocation information for the IP 8.8.8.8, then prints the IP address from the response. The code performs a simple, benign task of querying an API and outputting data. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and there are no hidden backdoors or data exfiltration activities. The code appears to be straightforward and intended for informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code retrieves information from a legitimate API and prints the IP address, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign utility function.",
