  "purpose": "Retrieve and print the IP address information for 8.8.8.8 using an external API.",
  "sources": "requests.get() call to 'https://ipapi.co/8.8.8.8/json/' to fetch IP data.",
  "sinks": "print() function outputs the IP address obtained from the API.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves data from external API -> JSON parsed -> IP address printed to console.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated and does not clearly describe its purpose. The code makes an external request to a third-party API without any validation or control over the data. The API endpoint is hardcoded, which could be used for tracking or malicious monitoring if misused, but there is no direct malicious activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated function that fetches geolocation/IP data from a third-party API (ipapi.co) for the IP address 8.8.8.8, then prints the IP. The external request is straightforward, with no data manipulation or suspicious behavior. The obfuscated naming might suggest an attempt to hide intent, but functionally, it only retrieves and prints information. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to perform a benign action of retrieving and printing IP information. The obfuscated function name could be suspicious, but there is no malicious behavior detected. It is a simple, potentially unnecessary network request and output.",
