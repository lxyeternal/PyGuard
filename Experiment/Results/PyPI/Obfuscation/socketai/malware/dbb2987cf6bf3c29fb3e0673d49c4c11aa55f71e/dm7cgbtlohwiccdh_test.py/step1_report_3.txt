  "purpose": "Retrieve and print the IP address information for the IP 8.8.8.8 using an external API.",
  "sources": "requests.get call to 'https://ipapi.co/8.8.8.8/json/' to fetch IP-related data.",
  "sinks": "Printing the 'ip' field from the JSON response; no data is sent elsewhere or stored.",
  "flows": "requests.get fetches data from the external API; the response is parsed and the IP address is printed.",
  "anomalies": "Function and variable names are obfuscated; the code performs a simple external API call but with no clear purpose; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated function that performs a GET request to 'https://ipapi.co/8.8.8.8/json/', retrieves JSON data, and prints the 'ip' field. The obfuscation may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but functionally it just fetches and displays public IP information for 8.8.8.8. No suspicious data flows, no data exfiltration, and no malicious activities are evident. The external call appears benign, possibly for informational purposes. Overall, no malicious or maliciously suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a simple API request to obtain IP information and prints the result. Despite obfuscated identifiers, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
