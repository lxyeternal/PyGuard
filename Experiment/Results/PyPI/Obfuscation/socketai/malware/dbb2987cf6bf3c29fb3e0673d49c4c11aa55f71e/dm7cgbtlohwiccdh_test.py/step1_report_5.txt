  "purpose": "Retrieve and print the IP address associated with the IP 8.8.8.8 using an external API.",
  "sources": "requests.get() call to https://ipapi.co/8.8.8.8/json/",
  "sinks": "Printing the IP address obtained from the API response.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves data from the API -> JSON parsing -> print() outputs the IP.",
  "anomalies": "Function and variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical; no user input handling or validation; no clear purpose other than data retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obscure name that fetches geolocation information for a fixed IP address (8.8.8.8) via an external API and prints the IP. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command execution, or connection to malicious domains. The API call and print are straightforward and benign. Obfuscated naming could be an attempt to hide intent, but the actual behavior is simple data retrieval and display, not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, no code injection, or malicious sinks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform a benign operation of fetching and printing an IP address from a reputable API. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
