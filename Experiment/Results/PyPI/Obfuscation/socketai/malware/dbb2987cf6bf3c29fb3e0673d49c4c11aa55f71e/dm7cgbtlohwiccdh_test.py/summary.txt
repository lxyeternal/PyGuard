  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, benign IP lookup with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation is mild and does not significantly elevate the threat level. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, and risk is minimal. Overall, the code is safe, with only minor obfuscation concerns."
