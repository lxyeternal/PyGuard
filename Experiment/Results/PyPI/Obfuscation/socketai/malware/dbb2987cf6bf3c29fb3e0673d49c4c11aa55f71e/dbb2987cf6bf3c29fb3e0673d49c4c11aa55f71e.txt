      "conclusion": "The setup script is not explicitly malicious but contains red flags such as obfuscation and a suspicious URL, indicating a high potential for supply chain attack if the external archive is malicious. The scores should reflect a high security concern, with malware around 0.8, obfuscation near 0.8, and overall risk above 0.75."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a simple purpose of fetching the public IP address. Obfuscation is present but not malicious. The malware score should be 0, and the security risk score should be very low (~0.1-0.2). The obfuscation score remains high (~0.7) due to naming but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code poses no security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is minimal and not inherently malicious; suspicion arises from the package name and syntax. No direct malicious activity is evident. The overall security risk is low, but further analysis of the 'httpsrequestsfast' package is recommended before trusting or deploying this code."

      "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, benign IP lookup with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation is mild and does not significantly elevate the threat level. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, and risk is minimal. Overall, the code is safe, with only minor obfuscation concerns."
