  "conclusion": "The setup script is not explicitly malicious but contains red flags such as obfuscation and a suspicious URL, indicating a high potential for supply chain attack if the external archive is malicious. The scores should reflect a high security concern, with malware around 0.8, obfuscation near 0.8, and overall risk above 0.75."
