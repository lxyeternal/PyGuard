  "purpose": "Utility class providing Base64 encoding and decoding for ASCII strings.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encoding/decoding methods.",
  "sinks": "Return of encoded/decoded ASCII strings; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input string -> encode/decode -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; no suspicious code patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward Base64 encoding and decoding on ASCII strings, with no external interactions or malicious patterns. Obfuscated identifiers are present but do not imply malicious intent. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected. The code's simplicity and lack of external effects confirm benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for Base64 operations with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity or security risks are present. The current malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate. Obfuscation is noted but not suspicious in this context.",
