  "purpose": "The code provides a class with methods for encoding and decoding strings using Base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken from method parameters (kkJOEFsfKwwbcGxJMbaTvRDnjNPDIYbe).",
  "sinks": "The encoded/decoded output is returned as a string. No direct data leakage or external network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input string → encode/decode → Base64 process → output string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code performs straightforward Base64 encoding/decoding without obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two methods: one for encoding a string to Base64 and another for decoding from Base64. Both methods convert input strings to ASCII bytes, perform Base64 operations, and return the result as ASCII strings. There are no external network calls, no file operations, and no dynamic code execution. The logic is simple and intended for encoding/decoding purposes. No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for Base64 encoding and decoding. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
