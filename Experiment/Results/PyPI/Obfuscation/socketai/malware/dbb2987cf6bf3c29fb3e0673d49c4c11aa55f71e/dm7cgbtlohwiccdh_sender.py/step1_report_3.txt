  "purpose": "The code provides functions for encoding and decoding strings using base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "Input data is read via the methods IiOgewNbnstpaEMrDDjXiWmiCGqgyWLa and CdUFUbNOFacSdyRblnJjzKskhwrQdkzd, which accept string parameters.",
  "sinks": "The decoded or encoded data is returned as strings. No external data sinks or network transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through encoding or decoding functions, returning the processed data; no external or untrusted sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The class uses obfuscated class and method names, which may be intended to conceal behavior. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious external interactions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods for base64 encoding and decoding strings. The encoding method converts a string to ASCII bytes, encodes to base64, then decodes back to ASCII. The decoding method reverses this process. There are no network calls, file operations, or external system interactions. The obfuscated naming might suggest an attempt to hide functionality, but the methods themselves are straightforward data transformations without malicious intent. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware signatures is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely provides simple base64 encoding and decoding functions with obfuscated names. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on the current implementation.",
