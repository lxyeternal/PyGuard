{
  "purpose": "The code provides simple base64 encoding and decoding functionality encapsulated in a class, likely intended for data obfuscation or encoding.",
  "sources": "Input data to the methods IiOgewNbnstpaEMrDDjXiWmiCGqgyWLa and CdUFUbNOFacSdyRblnJjzKskhwrQdkzd, which accept strings to encode or decode.",
  "sinks": "The encoded or decoded data is returned; no external sinks like network, file, or environment variable access are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are encoded/decoded, flowing from method parameters through base64 operations back to return values.",
  "anomalies": "The class uses obfuscated and non-descriptive method names, which could be suspicious, but the actual operations are straightforward base64 encoding/decoding. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods to encode and decode strings using base64, with no external dependencies or system calls. The obfuscated method names might indicate an attempt to hide purpose, but the core logic is simple encoding. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The code appears benign and functions solely for encoding and decoding data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of base64 encoding and decoding with obfuscated method names. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.",
