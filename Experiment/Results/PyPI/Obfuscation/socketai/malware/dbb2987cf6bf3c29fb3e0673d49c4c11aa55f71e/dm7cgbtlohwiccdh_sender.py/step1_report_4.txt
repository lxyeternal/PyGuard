  "purpose": "The code provides a simple utility class for encoding and decoding strings using Base64.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to encoding and decoding functions.",
  "sinks": "Decoded output strings from the decoding function.",
  "flows": "Input string -> encode method -> Base64 encoded string -> decode method -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The class and methods perform standard Base64 operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods for Base64 encoding and decoding of ASCII strings. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The methods only perform encoding and decoding, which are common and benign operations. No suspicious data flows or anomalies are present. The class name appears obfuscated but does not inherently imply malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to serve a straightforward purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple utility for Base64 encoding/decoding of strings with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears benign and intended for data transformation purposes.",
