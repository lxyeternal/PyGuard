  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential risks, and the consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports identify the core behavior: the setup script executes an external script `_build_tables.py` during build/install phases.\n- Obfuscated class and function names are consistently noted, raising suspicion.\n- The primary concern is the execution of an external script without validation, which could be malicious.\n- Malware scores are relatively low (0.2 - 0.4), indicating some concern but not high certainty of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are moderate (0.3 - 0.6), aligning with the external script execution concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code **does** execute `_build_tables.py` via `subprocess.check_call`. This is consistent across all reports.\n- The obfuscation of class and method names is also consistent and suspicious.\n- The use of fallback imports and dynamic execution without validation is noted.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No explicit errors or code flaws are evident in the reports; they are mainly about obfuscation and external script execution.\n- The reports correctly highlight the potential security concern without assuming malicious intent outright.\n- The malware scores are conservative, which is appropriate given the information.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware scores**: Given the external script execution and obfuscation, scores around 0.2-0.4 are reasonable. The reports do not provide evidence of malicious code within the provided snippet, only the risk of malicious content in `_build_tables.py`.\n- **Security risk scores**: Slightly higher than malware scores, reflecting the potential for harm if `_build_tables.py` is malicious.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable and aligned with the observed behavior.\n- If `_build_tables.py` is verified as benign, the malware score could be lowered.\n- If the external script's origin is unknown or untrusted, the risk scores should be maintained or increased.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**1. Code presence of issues:**  \nYes, the code executes an external script during setup, which is suspicious and a security concern.\n\n**2. Errors or flaws in reasoning:**  \nNo significant flaws; the reports are cautious and highlight obfuscation and external execution as red flags.\n\n**3. Scores justification:**  \nScores are conservative and justified given the obfuscation and external script execution. They could be slightly adjusted based on further evidence about `_build_tables.py`.\n\n**4. Risk scores (>0.5):**  \nNo report exceeds 0.6, which is appropriate. The highest is 0.6, reflecting moderate concern.\n\n**5. Malware score justification:**  \nLow to moderate (0.2-0.4). Without evidence of malicious code, this is reasonable.\n\n**6. Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \nThe reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the external script execution and obfuscation.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**  \nScores are consistent across reports, aligning with the described behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- The core concern is the execution of `_build_tables.py` during setup without validation.\n- Obfuscation adds suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent.\n- The scores are reasonable; minor adjustments could be made if `_build_tables.py` is verified safe.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0.3 (moderate concern due to external execution but no direct malicious code shown)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.8 (consistent with obfuscated names)\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 (moderate risk due to external script execution during build/install)\n\n**Final note:** The primary mitigation would be to verify the integrity and source of `_build_tables.py`. If trusted, the risk diminishes; if untrusted, the concern remains high.",
