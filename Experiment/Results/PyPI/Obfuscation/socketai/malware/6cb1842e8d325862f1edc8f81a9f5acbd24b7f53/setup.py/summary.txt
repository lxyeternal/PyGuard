  "conclusion": "The setup script's execution of an external, unverified script during build and install phases, combined with obfuscated naming, presents a significant supply chain security concern. While no malicious code is directly visible, the potential for malicious activity exists if '_build_tables.py' is compromised. Further investigation into the external script's integrity is strongly recommended."
