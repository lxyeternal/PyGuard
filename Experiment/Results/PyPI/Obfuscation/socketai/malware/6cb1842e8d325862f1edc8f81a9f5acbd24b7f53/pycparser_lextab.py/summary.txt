  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates low to moderate risk, with the primary concern being dynamic code execution without validation. Most code appears benign, but the use of exec() warrants caution. The scoring in the reports aligns with the observed patterns, and minor adjustments (e.g., increasing malware score in Report 5 to 0.4) could better reflect the potential threat. Overall, the code does not demonstrate confirmed malicious payloads but contains patterns that could be exploited if misused."
