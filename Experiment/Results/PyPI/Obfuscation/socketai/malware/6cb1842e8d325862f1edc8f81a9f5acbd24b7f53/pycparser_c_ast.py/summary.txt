  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, heavily obfuscated utility for object inspection and pretty-printing. Despite high obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The low malware and risk scores are justified, and the high obfuscation score reflects the code's obscurity. Overall, it appears benign but warrants caution if encountered in security-sensitive contexts due to obfuscation."
