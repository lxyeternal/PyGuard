{
  "purpose": "The code performs AST transformations related to switch-case structures and type declarations, likely for code analysis or manipulation.",
  "sources": "Reads AST nodes such as switch_node, switch_node.DGPELmfWcKJiBxNMIRtyXukczjkQztAO, and their attributes; recursive functions traverse and modify AST components.",
  "sinks": "Modifies AST node attributes in-place, appends to statement lists, and updates type attributes; no external data or system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Source nodes (AST nodes and their attributes) flow through recursive functions that modify or append to AST components, culminating in updated AST structures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable and attribute names, recursive functions that modify AST nodes, and checks for '_Atomic' attributes suggest obfuscation; no external malicious activity or system calls are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code manipulates AST nodes for switch-case and type declarations, using recursive functions to process and modify nodes. Obfuscated variable names hinder understanding but do not indicate malicious intent. No network, file, or system interactions are present. The recursive functions and attribute modifications are consistent with code analysis or transformation utilities. The high obfuscation score reflects difficulty in understanding, but the low malware score indicates no malicious payloads are detected. The overall security risk remains low, as the code appears benign but obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated AST processing utility, likely for code analysis or transformation, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not imply malicious activity based on the provided snippets.",
