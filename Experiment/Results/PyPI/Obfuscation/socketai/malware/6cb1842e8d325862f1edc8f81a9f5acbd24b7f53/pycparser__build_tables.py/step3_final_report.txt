  "purpose": "Assessment of supply chain security and malicious behavior in the analyzed open-source Python dependency.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment variables, network sockets, dynamic execution functions ('exec', 'eval'), and processes data; no explicit untrusted input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and dynamic code execution lead to network communication and data processing sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec'/'eval', obfuscated variable names, dynamic code generation, network activity, structural anomalies, and inconsistent code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits dynamic execution and network activity, which are typical indicators of malicious intent. The presence of obfuscation and dynamic code further increases suspicion. Benign code lacks such features and shows straightforward logic. The scores assigned in the reports align with these observations, with high suspicion scores for code exhibiting dynamic execution and network activity, and low scores for benign, straightforward code. The reasoning in each report is consistent and justified based on the described behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Report 2 demonstrates behaviors strongly indicative of malicious activity, justifying high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. Other reports describe benign code with no suspicious features, justifying low scores. Overall, the scoring and reasoning are appropriate and consistent with the observed code behaviors.",
