{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, intended to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from variable assignments and the setup() parameters; no external input is processed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not perform data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only initializes variables and calls setup() with static arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, inconsistent parameter naming (e.g., 'HbAooUrrZCOikIfqjDomiHJvYqJrJkEw' likely intended as 'version'), and potential malformed syntax suggest obfuscation or concealment. The parameter name appears intentionally confusing or malformed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and inconsistent parameter naming, which could be an attempt to conceal malicious intent. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. The obfuscation and malformed parameter raise suspicion but do not confirm malicious behavior. The malware score should be low (0.1), reflecting the lack of direct malicious activity, while the obfuscation score remains high (around 0.7) due to the nonsensical variable names. The overall security risk is low (around 0.2-0.4), primarily due to obfuscation concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script with obfuscation and inconsistent parameter naming. There is no evidence of malicious activity or payloads. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores should reflect low malware likelihood (0.1), high obfuscation (around 0.7), and low overall risk (around 0.2-0.4).",
