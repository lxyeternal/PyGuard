  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, specifying dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads package name, version, and dependencies from the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from variable assignments to the setup() function parameters, primarily static.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, inconsistent parameter naming (e.g., 'HbAooUrrZCOikIfqjDomiHJvYqJrJkEw' instead of 'version'), and unusual syntax such as random variable names and a misspelled or malformed 'keywords' argument. No sensitive data, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines variables with obfuscated names, assigns package metadata (name, version), and specifies dependencies. The syntax is somewhat malformed with inconsistent parameter naming, which might suggest obfuscation or an attempt to evade simple pattern detection. However, there are no indications of malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The presence of standard setup parameters indicates it is likely a benign setup script, albeit with obfuscated naming that raises suspicion about intent or origin.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package, but with obfuscated variable names and inconsistent syntax. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment. The obfuscation might be an attempt to conceal malicious intent, but nothing suspicious is explicitly present.",
