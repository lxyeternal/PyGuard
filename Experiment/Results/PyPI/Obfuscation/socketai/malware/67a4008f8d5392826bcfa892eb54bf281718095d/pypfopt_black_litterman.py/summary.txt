  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of the Black-Litterman model with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains low due to lack of active malicious indicators. Overall security risk is low, though obfuscation warrants cautious review if source trustworthiness is uncertain."
