  "purpose": "Implementation of the Black-Litterman portfolio optimization model, including functions for prior estimation, posterior calculation, and portfolio performance metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads market caps, covariance matrices, asset prices, views, and related financial data inputs.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (market data, views) through mathematical functions to compute priors, posterior estimates, and portfolio weights.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names with placeholder-like strings; presence of nonsensical comments and embedded strings such as 'BEWzpiZPbgSZgibjKYeBoMWBkoIucBhw'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard financial calculations related to the Black-Litterman model. Obfuscation is prominent, likely for proprietary concealment or placeholder purposes. No evidence of malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious commands. The heavy obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious intent. The functions and logic align with typical portfolio optimization routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of the Black-Litterman model with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains low due to lack of active malicious indicators. Overall security risk is low, though obfuscation warrants cautious review if source trustworthiness is uncertain.",
