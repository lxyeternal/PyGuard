{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for estimating expected returns, converting between prices and returns, and calculating risk metrics for financial assets, primarily using pandas DataFrames.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from pandas DataFrames containing asset prices or returns.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission or system modification observed; data flows within pandas DataFrames.",
  "flows": "Input data (prices or returns) flows through functions to produce expected returns, pseudo-prices, and risk metrics; no external sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names (e.g., BEWzpiZPbgSZgibjKYeBoMWBkoIucBhw), which appears to be an attempt to hinder readability but not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard financial analysis functions operating on pandas DataFrames. No signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification are present. The obfuscation is significant but seems aimed at intellectual property protection or complexity rather than concealment of malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.1-0.2, security risk: 0.2-0.4, confidence: 0.4-0.9) are consistent with the evidence. The absence of executable code snippets or network activity further supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate financial analysis toolkit with heavy obfuscation, likely for intellectual property reasons. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware or security risk scores. Overall, the code is considered benign with a low malware likelihood.",
