  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate financial analysis toolkit with heavy obfuscation, likely for intellectual property reasons. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware or security risk scores. Overall, the code is considered benign with a low malware likelihood."
