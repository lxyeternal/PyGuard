  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard portfolio objective functions with heavy obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity, malware, or sabotage. The high obfuscation score reflects the naming style, but the overall security risk remains low. Continuous monitoring and source verification are recommended due to obfuscation concerns."
