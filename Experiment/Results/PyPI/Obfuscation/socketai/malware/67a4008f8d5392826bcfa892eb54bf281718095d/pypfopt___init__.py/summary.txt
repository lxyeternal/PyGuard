  "conclusion": "The assessments across reports are reasonable and align with the available information. The absence of code in most reports justifies low scores for malware and obfuscation. The detailed analysis in Report 5 appropriately assigns a moderate security risk score, reflecting potential misuse without evidence of active malicious behavior. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears low risk, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation."
