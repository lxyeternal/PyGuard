  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a standard Python script for performing some functionality, but without seeing the actual code, the purpose cannot be definitively identified.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or imported modules; specific sources are not visible without the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network calls, file writes, database queries, or execution functions, but these cannot be confirmed without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks; the specific flow pathways are unknown without examining the actual code content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without the code. Absence of code precludes detection of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated sections, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information available; cannot perform step-by-step analysis without the actual code. No suspicious patterns or malicious constructs are identifiable without code content.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks. However, a proper assessment requires review of the actual code content.",
