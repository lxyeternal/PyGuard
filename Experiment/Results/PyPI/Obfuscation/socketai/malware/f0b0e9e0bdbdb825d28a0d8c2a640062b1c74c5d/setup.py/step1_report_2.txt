{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that includes additional behavior during installation, potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation ...', URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', and downloaded file 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe'",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, writing a file to disk, executing the downloaded file via os.system",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is used to generate a URL request; if on Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL, saves it locally, and executes it",
  "anomalies": "Code downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it during package installation; environment variable used to personalize requests; no validation or user consent shown",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and third-party 'requests'. It defines a function that reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, makes a GET request to a remote server including this info, and if on Windows, downloads and executes a potentially malicious executable. The custom install class calls this function during package installation, making the behavior potentially malicious. The URLs used are suspicious, and executing downloaded code poses significant security risks. The code appears intentionally designed to perform unauthorized actions during installation, indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation without user consent, indicating likely malicious intent. The use of environment variables and suspicious URLs further supports this conclusion.",
