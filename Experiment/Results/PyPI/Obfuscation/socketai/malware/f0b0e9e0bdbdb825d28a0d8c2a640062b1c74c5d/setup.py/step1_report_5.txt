{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a setup script for a Python package with additional functionality to download and execute a file from a remote server, potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation ...'; URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr'; downloaded content written to 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe'",
  "sinks": "Writing to file 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe' and executing it with 'os.system' when on Windows platform",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> URL request to 'linkedopports.com' -> download content -> write to 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe' -> execute file via 'os.system'",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except with empty except block; dynamic network request based on environment variable; execution of downloaded file without verification; downloading and executing a potentially harmful file during package installation",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup-related modules and a network request library. It defines a function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and makes a GET request to a suspicious URL, appending the environment variable. If running on Windows, it downloads an executable file from a suspicious domain and executes it. The custom install class calls this function during package installation. The use of environment variables, remote file download, and execution during setup strongly suggests malicious intent or a supply chain attack, aiming to run arbitrary code on the user's system without consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external file during package installation, which can compromise system security. The pattern indicates a potential supply chain attack or backdoor installation. Caution is strongly advised against using this package.",
