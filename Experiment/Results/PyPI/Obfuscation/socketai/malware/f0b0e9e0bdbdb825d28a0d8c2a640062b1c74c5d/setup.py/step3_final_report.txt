{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to run during package installation, read the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, send it to a suspicious URL, and if on Windows, download and execute a remote executable, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', network requests to suspicious URLs, file download and execution, and the setup script during installation.",
  "sinks": "Executing downloaded remote executable via os.system(), writing files to disk, and network requests sending data externally.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variable -> Sends data via GET request -> Downloads executable -> Saves to disk -> Executes via os.system during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function and class names, broad try-except blocks masking errors, downloading and executing remote code during installation, suspicious URLs, silent error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during package installation, using environment variables and obfuscated names to hide intent. The URLs are suspicious, and the silent exception handling masks potential errors. The pattern aligns with supply chain attacks or backdoors. The high malware score (0.9), obfuscation (0.8), and security risk (0.9) are justified given the evidence. The code's actions pose a severe threat to system integrity, warranting high alert. The reports correctly identify these issues, and their scores are consistent with the behavior. No logical errors are present in the assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, acting as a backdoor or dropper during setup, with high obfuscation and remote code execution. It poses a severe security risk and should be considered unsafe. The reports' evaluations and scores are accurate and justified.",
