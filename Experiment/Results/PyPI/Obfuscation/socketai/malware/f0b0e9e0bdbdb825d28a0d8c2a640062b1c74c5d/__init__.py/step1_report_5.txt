  "purpose": "Defines and calls a simple function that prints a message indicating installation",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reads",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Function and variable names are obfuscated, which could be suspicious, but they only call a print statement",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single function with an obfuscated name that prints a static message 'installed'. The function is invoked immediately after its definition. There are no external data inputs, no data processing, no network activity, or other suspicious behaviors. The obfuscated naming could be an attempt to hide intent, but the actual code performs a benign print operation. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly simplistic and benign, performing only a print statement. Although the function name is obfuscated, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security threats in this snippet.",
