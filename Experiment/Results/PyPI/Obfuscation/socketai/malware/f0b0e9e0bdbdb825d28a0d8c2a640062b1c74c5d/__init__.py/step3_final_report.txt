{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that prints 'installed' and executes it immediately. Its purpose appears to be a simple, benign print statement, possibly obfuscated to hide triviality.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or untrusted data read; the code is self-contained.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause leaks or effects; only a print statement is executed.",
  "flows": "Function call directly after definition; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; minimal code with no meaningful logic beyond printing a message.",
  "analysis": "The code is highly minimalistic, with an obfuscated function name that performs a benign print statement. There are no external data sources, network activity, or malicious payloads. The obfuscation is superficial and likely intended to hide triviality rather than malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the security risk is minimal. The high obfuscation score reflects the non-descriptive function name, but this does not imply malicious behavior. Confidence in benignity is high, though the obfuscation warrants cautious interpretation in larger contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple print statement within an obfuscated function. There is no evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is superficial and does not elevate the malware or security risk scores significantly. Overall, the code poses minimal security concern.",
