  "purpose": "The code defines a function that prints a message indicating installation status and then executes this function.",
  "sources": "The function call mvvPwvWYQvgfqOxmDEFdFnnRmeAQPFTB() at the end of the script.",
  "sinks": "The print statement, which outputs to the console.",
  "flows": "The script calls the function, which outputs 'installed'. No data flow from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The function name and variable names are obfuscated and non-descriptive, which could be an attempt to hide intent. The code performs a simple print statement with no other logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is minimal, defining a single function with an obfuscated name that outputs a message. The obfuscation raises suspicion, but the functionality is benign—merely printing a message. There are no inputs, data flows, or suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The obfuscation could be used to hide malicious intent, but based solely on this snippet, it appears to be harmless.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign print statement wrapped in an obfuscated function. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious intent, but it warrants caution if found in larger, unexplained codebases.",
