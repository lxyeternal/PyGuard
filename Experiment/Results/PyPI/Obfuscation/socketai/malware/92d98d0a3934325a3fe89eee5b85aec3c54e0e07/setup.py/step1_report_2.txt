  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package, specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools; string assignment for version; setup() function call with package name and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data or input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; setup only specifies static dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'pZeptXRmUvswLrasDLEgLqOYumpehTEY' for version, but no malicious behavior associated. No hardcoded credentials, no code obfuscation, no dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup using setuptools. It defines a package with a generic name and a set of dependencies, including common libraries like 'requests' and 'browser_cookie3'. No input/output processing, data leaks, or malicious constructs are present. The variable name appears obfuscated but does not affect functionality or security. The code does not contain any suspicious behavior or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script for a Python package with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It only specifies dependencies and package metadata.",
