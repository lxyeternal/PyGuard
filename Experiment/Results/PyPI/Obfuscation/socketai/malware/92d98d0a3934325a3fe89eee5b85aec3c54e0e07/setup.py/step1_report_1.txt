{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with specific dependencies.",
  "sources": "The version string '1.0.0', the package name 'wy5m5glrai8dm1ft', and the required dependencies: 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', 'requests'.",
  "sinks": "Installation process via setuptools; dependencies are specified but do not directly indicate malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "The code initializes package setup information and dependencies without additional data flow or runtime code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual package name (obfuscated) and variable name; no explicit malicious code or payload. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define a Python package. The package name and variable name appear obfuscated, which could be suspicious, but there is no active malicious behavior such as network communication, data collection, or backdoor functionality. The dependencies are common but could be used maliciously if misused, though nothing in this snippet indicates malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious code or obfuscated logic beyond the naming pattern. The script simply defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic setup script with obfuscated variable and package names. No malicious behavior is evident in this fragment. The package dependencies could potentially be used maliciously if misused but are otherwise common. No evidence of malware or security risks in this code snippet.",
