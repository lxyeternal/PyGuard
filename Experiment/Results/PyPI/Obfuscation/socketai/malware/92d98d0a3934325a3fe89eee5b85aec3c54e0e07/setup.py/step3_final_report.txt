  "purpose": "A simple Python setup script defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The variable assignment 'pZeptXRmUvswLrasDLEgLqOYumpehTEY', the import statements, and the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; the code does not process external data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The code assigns a version string to a variable, then calls setup() with package info and dependencies; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name and package name, which are superficial and do not impact functionality but could be used to evade detection.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The dependencies are common and do not indicate malicious intent in this context. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious behavior. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the security risk is minimal. The obfuscation score is moderate due to the variable and package names but not high enough to suggest malicious obfuscation. Overall, the code is benign, with superficial obfuscation that does not elevate security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The dependency list is common and not suspicious. The scores should remain at malware=0, with a slight increase in obfuscation score (~0.2), and a very low security risk (~0.1).",
