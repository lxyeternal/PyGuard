  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package including dependencies.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data at runtime.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or send data, nor does it invoke untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the script only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'pZeptXRmUvswLrasDLEgLqOYumpehTEY' which appears to be a random string; no clear reason for such naming. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, sets a version string, and calls setup() with package name and dependencies. The variable naming is unconventional and appears obfuscated but is syntactically valid. The dependencies include common libraries such as 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious actions. The code appears to be a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable naming, which alone is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with obfuscated variable naming but no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is likely used for packaging purposes without malicious payloads.",
