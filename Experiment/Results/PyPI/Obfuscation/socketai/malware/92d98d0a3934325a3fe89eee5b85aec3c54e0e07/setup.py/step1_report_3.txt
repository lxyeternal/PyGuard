  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the package metadata, dependencies list, and variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; no network or file output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows detected; the code only defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'pZeptXRmUvswLrasDLEgLqOYumpehTEY' which appears to be obfuscated or randomly generated; dependencies include libraries like 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', and 'robloxpy' that could be used for automation or malicious purposes, but their presence alone isn't suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools, with an obfuscated variable name likely serving no purpose beyond storage. No malicious code, network activity, or data handling is present. The dependencies could be used for malicious automation or data collection if misused, but the script itself does not perform any suspicious actions. The lack of code execution, data transfer, or secret handling indicates low risk. The main concern is the dependency choice, which could be leveraged maliciously outside this context, but within this script, there's no direct malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script with obfuscated variable naming but no malicious behavior. The dependencies could potentially be misused, but the code itself is benign.",
