      "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The dependency list is common and not suspicious. The scores should remain at malware=0, with a slight increase in obfuscation score (~0.2), and a very low security risk (~0.1)."
