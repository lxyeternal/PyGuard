{
  "purpose": "The code extracts Roblox cookies from various browsers, validates them via Roblox API, retrieves user information, and exfiltrates this data to a Discord webhook, all without user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies from Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome; Roblox API endpoints for validation and user info; hardcoded webhook URL.",
  "sinks": "Sending cookies and user data via POST request to external webhook; potential data leakage to attacker-controlled server.",
  "flows": "Cookies are read from browsers -> validated with Roblox API -> user info retrieved -> data formatted into message -> sent to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, broad try-except blocks hiding errors, undefined variables ('rid', 'roblox_profile', 'roblox_cookie'), hardcoded webhook URL, no user consent prompts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs cookie theft from multiple browsers, validates cookies, retrieves user data, and exfiltrates it to an external server. The use of silent exception handling and obfuscated variable names indicates malicious intent. Critical variables like 'rid' and 'roblox_cookie' are undefined, suggesting incomplete or intentionally obfuscated code. The data exfiltration to a hardcoded webhook without user knowledge confirms privacy violations. The overall behavior aligns with credential-stealing malware. The code lacks payloads like system damage or remote code execution but achieves significant privacy breach through data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to steal Roblox cookies and user information, and exfiltrate it to an attacker-controlled webhook. It exhibits obfuscation, poor error handling, and privacy violations, warranting a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1.",
