{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to extract Roblox account cookies from the user's browser, verify their validity, gather user information from Roblox, and then send this information to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookie data (from Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, Chrome), HTTP requests to Roblox API, user input from cookies",
  "sinks": "POST request to Discord webhook URL with sensitive user data, including cookies, Roblox user info, and IP address",
  "flows": "Browser cookies → Roblox API → User info retrieval → Discord webhook POST request",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple broad exception handling blocks (try-except) that silently pass, which can mask malicious activity or errors. Hardcoded Discord webhook URL and potentially sensitive data. The code aims to steal cookies and user info without user consent. Variable names are obfuscated and inconsistent. The script attempts to access cookies from multiple browsers, extract Roblox cookies, and send them externally.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, then attempts to extract Roblox cookies from various browser storage locations using 'browser_cookie3'. It retrieves cookies and verifies them via Roblox API to check validity. Upon validation, it collects user data such as user ID, username, Robux balance, account age, creation date, and profile picture. It then constructs a detailed message including the Roblox cookie and user info and posts it to an external Discord webhook. The code employs obfuscated and inconsistent variable naming, silent error handling, and lacks user consent prompts, indicating malicious intent to exfiltrate user credentials and personal information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to steal Roblox cookies and user information by extracting browser stored cookies, validating them, and sending detailed data to an attacker-controlled Discord webhook. It employs obfuscation, broad exception handling, and lacks user consent, confirming malicious intent.",
