{
  "purpose": "The script appears to gather Roblox account information, including cookies and user details, and send it via Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Cookie data from browser cookies (firefox, chrome, edge, opera, chrome), user information from Roblox API, IP address from ipify service.",
  "sinks": "Discord webhook URL where gathered data is posted, requests to Roblox API and ipify, possibly leaking cookies and user info.",
  "flows": "Cookies are retrieved from browser storage -> cookies are validated with Roblox API -> user info is fetched from Roblox API -> data (cookies, user info, IP) is formatted and sent via Discord webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Use of browser cookie libraries to extract '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies; hardcoded Discord webhook URL; attempts to send cookies if invalid; concatenated variable names that are not declared or used properly in the code (e.g., 'roblox_cookie' and 'rid'); unprofessional code style, inconsistent variable naming, missing declarations; apparent intention to exfiltrate user cookies and Roblox info.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves Roblox authentication cookies from various browser storages, validates the cookies with Roblox's API, and if valid, proceeds to collect user-specific data such as UserID, RAP, friends count, account age, creation date, headshot, username, Robux balance, and premium status. It then formats this data into a message and sends it via a Discord webhook URL, which is hardcoded. The code uses several obfuscated or inconsistent variable names, includes unnecessary imports, and attempts to exfiltrate user credentials and sensitive info without user consent. There is no evidence of malicious payloads like system damage, data theft beyond user info, or reverse shells. The primary malicious behavior is credential theft and data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This script is designed to steal Roblox account cookies and user information, then send the data to a remote Discord webhook, indicating malicious intent focused on credential theft and user data exfiltration. The code contains obfuscated elements and hardcoded secrets, which are typical in malicious scripts.",
