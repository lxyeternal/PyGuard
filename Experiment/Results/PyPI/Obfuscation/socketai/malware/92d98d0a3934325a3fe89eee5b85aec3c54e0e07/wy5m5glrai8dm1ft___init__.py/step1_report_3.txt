{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed to extract Roblox cookies from various browsers, verify their validity, retrieve user information from Roblox API, and send collected data via a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "browser_cookie3 library functions to access cookies; requests to fetch public IP and Roblox user info; the code also reads environment variables and system commands.",
  "sinks": "requests.post to send data to a Discord webhook; potential exposure of Roblox cookies and user data through the webhook.",
  "flows": "Cookies are extracted from browsers -> verified with Roblox API -> user info is retrieved -> data (including cookies and user info) is sent via webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling which suppresses errors; presence of hardcoded webhook URL; variable names are obfuscated; code structure is convoluted with inconsistent naming; potential misuse of environment variables and system commands; incomplete or undefined variables such as 'roblox_cookie', 'rolimons', 'roblox_profile', 'robux', 'crdate', 'rap', 'friends', 'age', 'ip_address', 'rid'.",
  "analysis": "The code extracts Roblox cookies from multiple browser types, which is suspicious as it attempts to gather user cookies without consent. It then verifies these cookies with Roblox's API. If invalid, it attempts to notify via a webhook, possibly exposing the cookie. It also retrieves user info, including UserID, RAP, friends count, age, creation date, and avatar; however, many variables such as 'roblox_cookie' and other data points are either undefined or incorrectly referenced. The code concludes by sending a formatted message with user info and the Roblox cookie to a Discord webhook, which constitutes a privacy leak and potential data theft. The obfuscated variable names and inconsistent coding practices suggest malicious intent or at least a tool designed for unauthorized data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors typical of malicious data harvesting: it extracts sensitive cookies, verifies and retrieves user info, then exfiltrates this data via a webhook. The use of hardcoded webhook URL, obfuscated variables, and broad exception handling reinforce suspicions of malicious intent. It potentially compromises user privacy by stealing Roblox cookies and personal information without consent.",
