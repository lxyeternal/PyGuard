{
  "purpose": "This script defines a Python package setup configuration that includes a custom installation command which executes decrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment info (os.name), decrypts a string with Fernet, and potentially fetches requests library if on Windows.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec(), network request via requests (import only, not necessarily used), possible use of decrypted data in execution.",
  "flows": "The code decrypts a Fernet-encrypted string and executes it if on Windows, which could lead to arbitrary code execution during install.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed during install, presence of hardcoded Fernet key, obfuscated variable names, and the execution of decrypted code are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script uses obfuscated variable names and encrypted payloads, decrypts a string with Fernet, and executes the decrypted code if on Windows. The decrypted code is unknown but could be malicious. The presence of decrypt and exec functions indicates potential malicious intent, especially given the obfuscation and execution of decrypted code during installation, which is a common technique for malware delivery. The setup process includes installing 'fernet' and 'requests' as dependencies, but their mere presence is not suspicious; however, the encrypted payload and its execution are high risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by decrypting and executing code during installation, which could execute arbitrary, potentially harmful code. The obfuscation and use of encrypted payload strongly suggest malicious intent. The overall security risk is high.",
