  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and executes conditional code during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment information (os.name), reads encrypted data for decryption, imports modules ('requests', 'fernet') during execution.",
  "sinks": "Executes decrypted code using 'exec', potentially running malicious payloads. Imports modules and executes code based on environment checks.",
  "flows": "Environment check (os.name) → Conditional import of 'requests' and 'fernet' → Execution of decrypted code via 'exec' in 'jfMsQZZQHpitriLXWbdGVqOjQDFtiYrO' method.",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted data in Fernet decryption executed with 'exec', which can run arbitrary code. The code appears intentionally obfuscated with random variable names and encrypted payloads. Hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload suggest malicious obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration with obfuscated variable names and an encrypted payload. During installation, if on Windows (nt), it decrypts and executes a code snippet via 'exec'. The decrypted code is hidden and could be malicious. The use of encrypted payloads and 'exec' indicates potential malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The code is intentionally obfuscated and involves sensitive operations that could be used to run malicious code silently.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated logic with encrypted payloads executed dynamically, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It appears designed to run hidden code during installation on Windows systems, representing a significant security risk. It should be considered malicious or at least dangerous and should not be used.",
