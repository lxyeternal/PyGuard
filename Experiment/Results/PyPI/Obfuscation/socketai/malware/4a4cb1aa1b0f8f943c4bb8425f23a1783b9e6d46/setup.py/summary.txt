  "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits classic malicious patterns—encrypted payloads, obfuscation, and runtime execution of hidden code—indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. It should be flagged as malicious or highly suspicious, and further analysis of the decrypted payload is recommended. The high scores assigned are consistent with the observed behavior and potential security threat."
