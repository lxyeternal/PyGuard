{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, including a custom installation class that executes encrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports modules ('os', 'requests', 'fernet'), and executes decrypted data via exec().",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code, which may be malicious if the decrypted payload is harmful or unexpected.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows ('nt'), the code decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet, which could lead to malicious activity if the payload is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload executed via exec() is suspicious; the decryption key is hardcoded and the decrypted code's purpose is hidden. The code uses obfuscated variable names and dynamically executes code during setup.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py with obfuscated variable names and unusual code. It conditionally executes encrypted code when on Windows, decrypting it with a hardcoded key and executing it via exec(). This behavior is suspicious because executing decrypted code at install time can be malicious, especially since the decrypted content is not revealed. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution indicates intent to hide malicious activity. The rest of the code appears normal for a setup script, but the presence of this decryption and execution strongly suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it decrypts and executes hidden code during installation on Windows, which could be used for malicious purposes. The obfuscation, encrypted payload, and dynamic execution are indicators of potential malicious intent.",
