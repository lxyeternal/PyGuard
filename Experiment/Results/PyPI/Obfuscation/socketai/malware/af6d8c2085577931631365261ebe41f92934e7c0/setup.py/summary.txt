  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious activity, including external exfiltration signaling and potential for code execution. The suspicious package metadata and hardcoded webhook URL reinforce this. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, with high malware (~0.85) and security risk (~0.8-0.9) levels, and a low obfuscation score (~0.2). The package should be considered malicious and avoided."
