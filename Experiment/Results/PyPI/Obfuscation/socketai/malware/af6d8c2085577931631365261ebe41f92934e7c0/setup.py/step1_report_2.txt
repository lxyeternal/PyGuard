{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package setup script with an attempt to send data to a Discord webhook, potentially as part of malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, import statements, and the webhook URL string.",
  "sinks": "Requests.post() call that sends data to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Imports requests -> attempts to POST data to Discord webhook -> ignores exceptions -> proceeds to read README.md -> sets up package with setuptools.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a webhook URL with a message ('content': 'niger') sent via requests.post(), which is suspicious. The exec() call is empty and unused, which could indicate an attempt to obfuscate or misuse. The package name and author details are intentionally vague, and the setup script includes potentially malicious code that communicates externally.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import the 'requests' library and sends a POST request to a Discord webhook URL with hardcoded content. The 'exec()' call is empty, indicating possible obfuscation or incomplete code. The exception handling silently ignores any errors, which can mask malicious activity. The package setup includes typical fields but is paired with suspicious external communication, which could be used for command-and-control or data exfiltration. Overall, the primary concern is the webhook POST, which indicates malicious intent to notify or control external parties.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious activity by sending data to an external webhook, likely for notification or control purposes. The overall structure suggests an attempt to disguise or obscure malicious intent, though no obfuscation techniques are explicitly used. The package could be used as part of a supply chain attack to exfiltrate data or notify an attacker of installations.",
