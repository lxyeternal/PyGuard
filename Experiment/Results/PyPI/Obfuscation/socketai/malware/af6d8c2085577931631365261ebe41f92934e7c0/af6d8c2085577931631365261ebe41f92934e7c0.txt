      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious activity, including external exfiltration signaling and potential for code execution. The suspicious package metadata and hardcoded webhook URL reinforce this. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, with high malware (~0.85) and security risk (~0.8-0.9) levels, and a low obfuscation score (~0.2). The package should be considered malicious and avoided."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code pattern of decoding a base64 string and executing it dynamically is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent. The high obfuscation and execution of unknown code warrant a high malware and risk score. It should be treated as malicious until further payload analysis confirms benignity. The pattern is a common technique in malware and supply chain sabotage, making it a critical security concern."
