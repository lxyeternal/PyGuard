  "conclusion": "The code pattern of decoding a base64 string and executing it dynamically is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent. The high obfuscation and execution of unknown code warrant a high malware and risk score. It should be treated as malicious until further payload analysis confirms benignity. The pattern is a common technique in malware and supply chain sabotage, making it a critical security concern."
