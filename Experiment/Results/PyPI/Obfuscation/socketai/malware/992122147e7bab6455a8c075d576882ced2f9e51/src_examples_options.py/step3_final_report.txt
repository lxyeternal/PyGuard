  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Patterns indicating obfuscation, eval/exec usage, hardcoded secrets, dynamic imports, network activity, and code complexity.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, code injection points, network connections, and dynamic code execution pathways.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec leading to malicious actions or data exfiltration; obfuscated code obscuring malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, complex control flow, minimal comments, suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The reports collectively identify suspicious patterns like obfuscation, eval/exec, and hardcoded secrets in Report 1, justifying high malware (0.6), obfuscation (0.7), and security risk (0.75) scores. Reports 3 and 4 describe benign code with no suspicious activity, aligning with low scores (malware 0, risk 0.2). Report 5 notes dynamic features and complexity, assigning moderate scores (malware 0.2, obfuscated 0.2, risk 0.3). The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with Report 1's high suspicion justified by the anomalies, and benign reports correctly scored at minimal risk. Overall, the scores reflect a cautious but justified assessment based on the evidence provided.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity in Report 1, with justified high malware and obfuscation scores. The benign reports are correctly scored at low risk. The moderate suspicion in Report 5 warrants a cautious approach. Overall, the scoring aligns with the reported anomalies and analysis, indicating a need for further code review to confirm malicious intent where suspicion exists.",
