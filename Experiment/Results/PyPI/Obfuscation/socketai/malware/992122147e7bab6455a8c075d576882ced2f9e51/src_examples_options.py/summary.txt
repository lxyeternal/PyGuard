  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity in Report 1, with justified high malware and obfuscation scores. The benign reports are correctly scored at low risk. The moderate suspicion in Report 5 warrants a cautious approach. Overall, the scoring aligns with the reported anomalies and analysis, indicating a need for further code review to confirm malicious intent where suspicion exists."
