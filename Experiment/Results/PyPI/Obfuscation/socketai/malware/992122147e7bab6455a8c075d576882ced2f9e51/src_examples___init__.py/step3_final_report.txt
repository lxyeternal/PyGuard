  "sources": "No code provided; no data sources to analyze.",
  "sinks": "No data flows; no sinks present due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink paths; no code to evaluate.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the lack of code, leading to zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk. Reports with no code appropriately reflect no malicious activity or obfuscation. The reports that mention suspicious patterns (dynamic execution, obfuscation, network activity) are justified in their higher scores based on their descriptions. The scoring aligns with the described behaviors and analysis, with no inconsistencies observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are consistent and accurate given the absence of code or the described suspicious patterns. No further improvements are necessary.",
