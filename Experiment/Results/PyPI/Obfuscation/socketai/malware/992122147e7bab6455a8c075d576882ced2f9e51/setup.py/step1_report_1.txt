{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, upon installation or development setup, executes a base64-encoded command likely intended to run malicious code.",
  "sources": "The function 'notmalfunc' reads a base64-encoded string, which is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The decoded command is passed to os.system, which executes shell commands, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "The base64 string 'dHlwZSBudWwgPiBwcnVlYmExMS50eHQKZGly' is decoded by 'b64d', then executed by 'notmalfunc' via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and dynamic execution in 'notmalfunc' is suspicious, especially since the decoded string appears to be a shell command that can run arbitrary code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines custom install/develop commands. The 'notmalfunc' function decodes a base64 string and executes it via os.system. The base64 string decodes to 'type nul > purpleba11.txt\ndir', which creates or overwrites a file 'purpleba11.txt' and lists directory contents. This behavior alone is not malicious; however, the structure and obfuscated execution suggest potential malicious intent. The command could be easily replaced with malicious payloads. The script's purpose appears to be to run code upon package installation or development setup, which is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation and dynamic command execution, indicative of malicious intent or at least malicious capability, especially as it runs code during package installation. The payload itself is benign but could be replaced with harmful commands, indicating a potential supply chain risk.",
