{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package, but it includes obfuscated malicious behavior that executes hidden code during installation.",
  "sources": "The function b64d decoding a base64-encoded string, and the call to os.system with decoded code.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded code which likely runs arbitrary commands.",
  "flows": "The base64 string decodes to a command, which is then executed via os.system during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to hide code execution, executing system commands during installation, lack of transparency about the command's purpose.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports standard modules and defines a function b64d to decode base64 strings. The notmalfunc() function decodes a specific base64 string, which translates to a command: 'type nul > prueba11.txt\ndir'. This command creates an empty file named prueba11.txt and then lists directory contents. The command is executed via os.system inside the AfterInstall class's run method, which runs during package installation. This behavior is suspicious because it executes system commands without any clear legitimate purpose, indicating potential malicious intent to run arbitrary code or manipulate the system environment during installation. The code uses obfuscation techniques (base64 encoding) to hide its true purpose. Overall, the malicious code runs during setup, making this package potentially dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes obfuscated, malicious behavior by executing system commands during package installation, which could be used for malicious activities such as system modification or data exfiltration. The use of base64 encoding and execution of arbitrary commands strongly indicates malicious intent.",
