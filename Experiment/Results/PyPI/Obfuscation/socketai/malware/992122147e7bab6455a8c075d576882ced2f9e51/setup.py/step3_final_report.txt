{
  "purpose": "The code decodes a base64-encoded command and executes it during package installation or development setup, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in 'notmalfunc()' which is decoded and executed via os.system() during setup.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executing the decoded command, which can lead to arbitrary command execution on the host system.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded in 'notmalfunc()', then passed directly to os.system(), executing the command during install or develop phases.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate a command that creates a file and lists directory contents; execution during setup is suspicious; no external input is involved.",
  "analysis": "The script defines custom install and develop commands that, during execution, decode a base64 string to a command ('type nul > purpleba11.txt\\n dir') and run it via os.system(). The command is benign but the pattern of obfuscation and execution during package setup is characteristic of malicious or sabotage behavior. The current payload is harmless, but the code structure allows easy replacement with malicious commands. The obfuscation and execution pattern justify high security concern, with scores reflecting potential malicious intent despite benign current commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation and executes decoded commands during setup, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The current payload is benign, but the pattern indicates a high risk of malicious payload substitution. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, though slightly conservative regarding the benign nature of the current command.",
