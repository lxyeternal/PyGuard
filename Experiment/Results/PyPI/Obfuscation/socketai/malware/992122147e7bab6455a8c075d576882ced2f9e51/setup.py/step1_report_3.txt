{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes hooks to execute additional code after installation or development setup, specifically running a base64-encoded script.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in the function b64d, executed within notmalfunc(), which is called during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The decoded code executed by os.system, which could run arbitrary commands on the host system.",
  "flows": "The b64d function decodes the base64 string to code, then notmalfunc() runs this code via os.system, executing potentially malicious commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate code that is then executed via os.system. The base64 string decodes to a command that prints 'type null > pruebaxxx.txt' and then executes a decoded command, possibly indicating malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package setup behavior. It includes functions for decoding base64 strings and executing them through os.system. During installation (in AfterInstall.run), it calls notmalfunc(), which executes a decoded base64 string. The decoded command appears to write 'null' into a file named 'pruebaxxx.txt'. The obfuscation through base64 and execution via os.system pose security risks, as this pattern is common in malicious code to hide behavior. The purpose seems to be to perform unintended system modifications or covert operations during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated execution of a system command during installation, which could be malicious or disruptive. The pattern of decoding and executing base64-encoded code is suspicious and aligns with malicious behavior patterns. Overall, this package exhibits malicious behavior risk due to the hidden execution step.",
