  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, with custom install and develop commands that execute a hidden payload.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in notmalfunc() used in os.system call",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing decoded base64 code, which runs arbitrary code",
  "flows": "The code decodes base64 string -> executes resulting code via os.system",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded string to hide command, automatic execution during install phase, lack of explicit documentation about malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package setup parameters. It includes functions to decode base64-encoded code and executes this code in the notmalfunc() function. This function is called during the install process via a custom AfterInstall class, which overrides the run() method to execute notmalfunc(). The base64 string decodes to 'type null > purueba11.txt\ndir', which is harmless, but the pattern suggests the potential to run arbitrary or malicious commands. The code is obfuscated through base64 encoding and automatic execution during setup, indicating malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains a hidden payload that executes a decoded command during installation, which is suspicious. While the decoded command appears harmless ('type null > purueba11.txt\\ndir'), the use of base64 encoding and execution during setup strongly suggests malicious or sabotage behavior. The overall security risk is high due to the hidden execution of arbitrary code.",
