  "purpose": "Define a setup configuration for a Python package that includes hooks to execute additional code during installation and development.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string within notmalfunc() that is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded base64 command, which likely runs shell commands.",
  "flows": "b64d() decodes base64 string -> notmalfunc() executes command via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64 decoding to obfuscate code; executes system commands during install. The command 'dHlwZSBudWwgPiBwcnVlYmExMS50eHQKZGly' decodes to 'type nul > prvba11.txt\\ndir', which creates an empty file and lists directory contents. Obfuscation and execution during install are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package using setuptools. It defines functions to decode base64 strings and executes a command that creates an empty file and lists directory contents during installation (via notmalfunc()). The code is straightforward but employs base64 encoding to hide its true purpose, which is suspicious. Executing shell commands during install is a common tactic in malicious packages to perform unauthorized actions or prepare environment manipulation. No external inputs are used, but the obfuscation suggests malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated execution of shell commands during package installation, which could be used maliciously. The commands create an empty file and list directory contents, which may be benign but are suspicious in context. Overall, the code demonstrates potentially malicious obfuscation and execution pattern.",
