{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for a Python package, with custom installation behavior that includes code execution during install.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports external modules ('requests', 'fernet'), and executes decrypted code via Fernet in the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code within the 'exec' function, which can run arbitrary Python code supplied by the decrypted payload.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows ('nt'), the code imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a payload and executes it dynamically with 'exec', which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and execution of decrypted code during setup. The decrypted payload is hardcoded and appears malicious or suspicious due to obfuscation and execution context.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a package setup configuration. It contains a custom install class that, if on Windows, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a base64-encoded string and executes it via 'exec'. The encrypted payload is hardcoded and appears to be malicious, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution during installation. The obfuscated variable names and encrypted payload suggest malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks beyond this behavior. The decryption and execution of arbitrary code pose a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior: during installation on Windows, it decrypts and executes potentially malicious code, which is highly suspicious. The code is obfuscated, and the presence of hardcoded encrypted payloads indicates malicious intent, representing a high security risk.",
