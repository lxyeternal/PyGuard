{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, including a custom installation command that executes code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, executes decrypted code via Fernet, imports modules like os, requests, and fernet during installation.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes decrypted code which could be malicious, especially if the decrypted payload is harmful or external requests are made.",
  "flows": "During installation, if on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports modules and decrypts and executes a payload, then proceeds with the standard install process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload executed during install, and conditional execution only on Windows. The code decrypts and executes a hardcoded encrypted string, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with metadata and a custom install command. The custom install command, 'SvDTQmxRafvSAszJinAcFJYelcnTQXfs', conditionally runs on Windows. It imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts and executes a hardcoded encrypted payload. The decryption key and payload are hardcoded, indicating malicious intent or backdoor behavior, as it allows code execution during installation, possibly downloading or executing malicious code. The obfuscation via random variable names and encrypted code suggests malicious concealment. The overall code structure is suspicious because it executes code dynamically during package installation based on OS, which could be exploited to run malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains a likely malicious backdoor that decrypts and executes code during installation on Windows systems. The use of encrypted payloads and obfuscated code indicates malicious intent or sabotage. Caution is advised before using this package.",
