{
  "purpose": "Detects malicious code execution during package installation on Windows by decrypting and executing an encrypted payload, indicating a supply chain backdoor.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded encrypted payload, import statements for requests and fernet, OS check for Windows, execution of decrypted code via exec()",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted payload, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or data exfiltration",
  "flows": "OS check -> import requests and fernet -> decrypt payload -> execute payload with exec()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload hardcoded in source, code executes during setup, conditional on Windows OS",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script with a custom install class that, on Windows, imports requests and fernet, decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload, and executes it via exec(). The variable names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation. The decrypted payload is hidden, and its execution during installation suggests malicious intent. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack tactics, such as deploying backdoors or malicious payloads. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores assigned in reports are justified by the code's actions. The use of exec() on decrypted code, encrypted payloads, and conditional OS-specific execution strongly indicate malicious activity. The scores are consistent and appropriate, with malware and risk scores near 1.0, and obfuscation high but justified. Overall, the code is malicious, designed to conceal harmful behavior, and should be flagged accordingly.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious backdoor that decrypts and executes code during Windows installation, with obfuscation and encrypted payloads used to conceal intent. The high scores assigned in reports are justified; the package poses a severe security threat and should be avoided.",
