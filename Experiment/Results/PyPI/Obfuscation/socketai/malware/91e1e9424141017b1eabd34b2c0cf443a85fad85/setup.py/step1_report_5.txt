{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package with some embedded code execution during installation, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The encrypted string and Fernet decryption within the install method; environment variables and package data are not explicitly read elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code using 'exec', network requests via 'requests' module, and potential use of Fernet encryption for secure communications or malicious payload delivery.",
  "flows": "During installation, if on Windows ('nt'), the code imports 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypts a payload, and executes it, potentially retrieving and executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload decrypted and executed during install, dynamic execution with 'exec', conditional code based on OS, inclusion of encrypted data, and external modules (requests, fernet) to fetch or execute malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily serves to decrypt and execute code during the installation process on Windows systems. The encrypted payload is loaded and executed dynamically, which is suspicious. The code's obfuscated variables and conditional logic suggest malicious intent. The setup configuration itself appears legitimate, but the embedded behavior during install poses a security risk. The presence of 'requests' and 'fernet' as setup dependencies further supports potential malicious activity, such as downloading and executing remote code.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior designed to decrypt and execute code during installation on Windows systems, indicating a supply chain attack vector. The encrypted payload and dynamic execution are key indicators of malicious intent, and the package should not be trusted or used.",
