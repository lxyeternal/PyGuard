{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with potentially malicious code execution on Windows during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information (os.name), imports requests and fernet, and executes decrypted code via exec().",
  "sinks": "exec() with decrypted payload can execute arbitrary code, potentially malicious actions like system modification or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The decrypted Fernet payload is executed directly, which can run any malicious code; it is triggered only on Windows OS.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names, encrypted payload, and conditional code execution on Windows are suspicious. The decrypted payload is not visible, indicating obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports critical modules and conditionally executes a decryption and execution routine on Windows OS, using Fernet symmetric encryption to hide malicious payload. The payload is decrypted and executed dynamically via exec(), which is a common technique for obfuscation and malicious activity. The setup process includes a custom class that performs this operation during installation. The use of non-standard variable names and the encrypted string strongly suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent. No benign purpose is evident for decrypting and executing arbitrary code during install.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears malicious, with obfuscated encrypted payload executed conditionally on Windows. It is designed to hide malicious actions, likely performing harmful operations during package installation. The code should be treated as malicious and avoided.",
