{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package with obfuscated and potentially malicious behavior, including a payload that executes code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, system information, and network requests during installation; particularly, it imports modules like os, requests, and fernet, and executes decrypted code based on environment conditions.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code within the install class method, potentially leading to remote code execution, network communication, or malicious payload deployment.",
  "flows": "During installation, the script checks if the OS is Windows, then decrypts and executes code using Fernet, which could be malicious. The flow involves reading environment info, then executing decrypted payload.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload execution, and dynamically decrypts and runs code during setup, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. The payload is only decrypted and run on Windows, which is a common tactic to conceal malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a custom install class with an overridden method. Within this method, it conditionally executes code only on Windows. The code imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts a hardcoded payload with Fernet and executes it with exec(). The package setup includes obfuscated strings and encrypted payload, indicating intent to hide malicious code. This behavior is typical of malicious package tampering or supply chain attacks, aiming to execute arbitrary code during installation. The overall design and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent, especially given the decrypted payload execution on Windows systems, a common target platform for malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears malicious due to its obfuscated nature, encrypted payload execution, and conditional execution during package installation. It likely intends to run malicious code on Windows systems covertly, posing a security risk if used or installed. The package should be considered dangerous and avoided.",
