  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for a Python package, defining package name and version.",
  "sources": "Static package name and version in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or randomly generated package name 'vg5d0n3mc9bg4mii', which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward use of setuptools to define package metadata. No malicious code, data leaks, or external network activity are present. The only suspicious aspect is the obfuscated package name, which could be used to hide malicious intent but, in this context, shows no evidence of malicious behavior. Malware score is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code. The obfuscation score is high (around 0.8), justified by the unusual name. The security risk score is low (around 0.1), reflecting minimal threat aside from naming suspicion. All reports correctly identify the code as benign with no malicious activity, and their scoring aligns with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign setup script with an obfuscated package name. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are detected. The high obfuscation score warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal.",
