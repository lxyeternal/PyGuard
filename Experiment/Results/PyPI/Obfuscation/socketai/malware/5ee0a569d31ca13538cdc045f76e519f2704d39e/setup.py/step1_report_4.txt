  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that specifies dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the package name, version, and dependencies for installation.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code does not directly handle untrusted data or perform data output.",
  "flows": "Reads package configuration and dependencies; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name 'IHVXiQrrbiyliDgZtsnPcoBtyiWMBAih' appears obfuscated or nonsensical; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'setuptools' to define a package setup, including name, version, and dependencies. The variable name assigned the version is unusual but not inherently malicious. The dependencies include 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. These are common libraries; however, some like 'discordwebhook' could be used for malicious purposes such as sending messages or exfiltrating data if misused. The setup script itself does not perform any malicious actions; it simply defines the package configuration. There are no code injections, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with an unusual variable name but no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The dependencies could potentially be misused in other contexts, but the script itself is benign.",
