  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining dependencies and version.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call, particularly the 'install_requires' list.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of dependencies to perform malicious actions such as web requests or cookie theft.",
  "flows": "Dependencies like 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests' could be exploited if misused to gather or exfiltrate data.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name 'IHVXiQrrbiyliDgZtsnPcoBtyiWMBAih' is unusual and unused; no code performs actions beyond dependency declaration. The package name 'vipigqsoj9za0gti' appears obfuscated or randomly generated.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily consists of a standard setup() call with a version variable and a list of dependencies. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated, but it is not used further. The dependencies include libraries that can perform web requests, cookie access, and interactions with web services, which could be exploited maliciously if the package's runtime code (not shown here) uses them maliciously. No code in this snippet performs any data collection, network activity, or file operations. Without additional code, no malicious behavior can be confirmed. The obfuscated variable and package name could indicate an attempt to hide intent, but based solely on this code, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup with obfuscated variable and package name. No direct malicious activity or security risks are evident from this snippet alone. However, the presence of dependencies capable of malicious actions warrants caution if additional code is present elsewhere.",
