{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed to extract Roblox cookies from browser storage, validate them, gather user information via Roblox APIs, and send this data to a specified Discord webhook. It also seems to collect IP address information and user profile details.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) for domain 'roblox.com', user input via system commands, web requests to external APIs (ipify.org, Roblox endpoints), RobloxPy library functions for user data, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Posting data to the Discord webhook URL, possibly exposing Roblox cookies, user IDs, and other personal info via webhook messages. Requests to Roblox endpoints and IP geolocation services could leak sensitive user data.",
  "flows": "Cookie extraction sources feed into validation and Roblox API calls, which retrieve user info. The obtained data flows into constructing webhook messages and external API requests. Cookie validation results determine whether data is sent or the script exits.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL containing sensitive endpoint, use of `os.system` for command execution, attempts to collect cookies across multiple browsers, lack of error handling for API failures, and unreferenced variables and incomplete URL string (e.g., 'https://www.rolimons.com/player/{rid}'). The code contains several incomplete or undefined variables (e.g., 'roblox_cookie', 'rolimons', 'roblox_profile', 'rid', 'robux', 'crdate', 'rap', 'friends', 'age', 'ip_address'), which indicates possible obfuscation or incomplete code. There are also suspiciously formatted string concatenations and missing variable definitions that could lead to runtime errors.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing modules, including third-party libraries that facilitate cookie access, web requests, and Roblox API interaction. It then defines functions to execute system commands and clear the console. It attempts to extract Roblox cookies from various browser storages and validate them via Roblox API calls. If validation fails, it posts an alert containing the expired cookie to a Discord webhook and terminates.\n\nIf validation succeeds, it retrieves user info such as UserID, username, Robux balance, account age, creation date, and profile headshot using RobloxPy functions. It also fetches the public IP address. However, numerous variables used in the final webhook message are undefined or incomplete, suggesting the code is either obfuscated or improperly assembled.\n\nThe script's main malicious intent appears to be harvesting Roblox cookies and user data, then exfiltrating that data through a webhook, potentially for malicious profiling or account hijacking. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and cookie access functions indicates malicious use rather than legitimate analysis or debugging.\n\nOverall, the script exhibits suspicious behavior characteristic of credential theft, data exfiltration, and possible account compromise tools. The code structure and variable inconsistencies strongly suggest malicious intent rather than a benign or functional utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious, primarily designed for malicious cookie harvesting, user data exfiltration, and possibly account hijacking. It contains hardcoded sensitive endpoints, unhandled variables, and functions that could enable unauthorized data collection. The overall security risk is high, and the code should be treated as malicious.",
