{
  "purpose": "The script appears to extract Roblox account cookies from browser storage, validate the cookie, gather user information from Roblox, and send this information to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) for domain 'roblox.com'; external API requests to ipify.org, Roblox API, and possibly external endpoints for user data.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL with collected user data; potential exposure of cookies and user info via webhook message.",
  "flows": "Cookies read from browser storage (sources) -> cookie validation via Roblox API -> data collection from Roblox API -> data sent to Discord webhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL; code uses obfuscated variable names; code attempts to access multiple browser cookie stores without clear validation; potential misuse of cookies; incomplete or malformed code lines at the end referencing undefined variables like 'rid', 'roblox_cookie', 'rolimons', 'roblox_profile', 'robux', 'crdate', 'rap', 'friends', 'age', 'ip_address'.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to harvest Roblox '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies from various browser stores, validate the cookies with Roblox's API, and collect user data such as UserID, username, Robux balance, account age, creation date, friends count, and profile headshot. It then attempts to send this data via a Discord webhook URL hardcoded in the script. The code employs obfuscated variable names and multiple try-except blocks, which suggest attempts to hide its true purpose. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL, cookie theft logic, and data exfiltration indicates malicious intent, especially considering the collection of sensitive cookie data and sending it externally. However, the script is incomplete or contains errors, especially towards the end where several variables are undefined, which could be due to obfuscation or code corruption. Overall, the code acts as a cookie stealer and data exfiltration tool targeting Roblox accounts, which is malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is malicious, designed to steal Roblox account cookies and personal data, and exfiltrate this information to an external Discord webhook. It employs obfuscation and multiple browser cookie sources to evade detection. Due to the presence of hardcoded webhook URL and cookie harvesting logic, it is considered highly malicious.",
