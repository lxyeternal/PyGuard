{
  "purpose": "The code appears to extract Roblox cookies from browser cookies, verify their validity, retrieve user information via Roblox API, and send data via a Discord webhook. It seems intended for user data collection and reporting.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (firefox, chrome, edge, opera) for domain 'roblox.com'; HTTP requests to 'https://api.ipify.org/', Roblox API endpoints, and external RobloxPy library functions.",
  "sinks": "Requests to the Discord webhook URL with collected user info; potential transmission of sensitive Roblox account data; uses os.system to run commands.",
  "flows": "Cookie extraction from browsers -> cookie validation -> Roblox API data retrieval -> constructing user info report -> POST request to Discord webhook with user info and cookies.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL; use of os.system for command execution; use of broad exception handling without logging; inconsistent variable usage and incomplete code segments (e.g., undefined variables 'roblox_cookie', 'rid', 'rolimons', etc.); potential attempts at data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script collects Roblox security cookies from multiple browsers, validates these cookies through Roblox API, and fetches user details like UserID, username, and balance. It constructs a detailed report and sends it to a specified Discord webhook. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and use of os.system indicates possible malicious intent for unauthorized data collection and exfiltration. The code has incomplete parts, which may prevent execution, but the core pattern suggests targeted account data harvesting and reporting.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a data harvester for Roblox user cookies and account info, sending the data to an external webhook. Its malicious potential is high due to cookie extraction, data collection, and exfiltration mechanisms, combined with hardcoded sensitive endpoints. The code is suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes.",
