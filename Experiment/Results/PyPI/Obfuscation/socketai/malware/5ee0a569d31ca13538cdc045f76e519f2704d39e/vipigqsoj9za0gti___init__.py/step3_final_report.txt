{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox cookies from various browsers, validate them via Roblox API, gather user information, and exfiltrate this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook, indicating malicious intent for credential theft and data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Browser cookie storage locations (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) where cookies named '.ROBLOSECURITY' are read.",
  "sinks": "The external Discord webhook URL where the collected cookies and user data are sent via HTTP POST requests.",
  "flows": "Cookies are retrieved from browser storage, validated via Roblox API, user info is gathered, and then data (including cookies and user details) flows from source (cookie storage) through validation and data collection steps to the sink (webhook URL).",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names, multiple try-except blocks with broad exception handling, references to undefined variables (e.g., roblox_cookie, rid, roblox_profile), and a hardcoded webhook URL suggest attempts to hide malicious intent and incomplete or intentionally obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script accesses browser cookies related to Roblox, attempts to validate the cookie via Roblox API, and upon validation, collects user information such as UserID, username, and other profile data. It then exfiltrates this sensitive data to a remote Discord webhook. The presence of obfuscated variable names, multiple browser sources, and incomplete variable references indicates an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The core behavior—cookie theft, data exfiltration, and obfuscation—aligns with malicious intent, with no evidence of destructive payloads or system damage. The code's primary purpose is credential theft and privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, primarily designed for stealing Roblox user cookies and personal data, validating them, and exfiltrating this information to an external server via a webhook. The obfuscation and incomplete variables further suggest malicious intent aimed at evading detection. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score is justified as approximately 0.85.",
