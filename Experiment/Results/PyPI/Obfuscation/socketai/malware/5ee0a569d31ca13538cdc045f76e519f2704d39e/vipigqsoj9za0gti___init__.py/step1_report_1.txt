{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed to extract Roblox user data and cookies from the browser, validate the cookies, gather user information via Roblox APIs, and then send this information to a Discord webhook, potentially for malicious data collection or unauthorized monitoring.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (firefox, chrome, edge, opera, chrome), HTTP requests to external services (ipify, roblox API, external user info), user input (if any), hardcoded webhook URL",
  "sinks": "Discord webhook (sending user data), system commands (via os.system), HTTP requests that transmit potentially sensitive information",
  "flows": "Cookies retrieved from browser → validation of cookies → fetching user info via Roblox API → sending user info and cookies to Discord webhook",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, obfuscated variable and function names, use of multiple browser cookie sources without clear necessity, retrieving cookies for Roblox without user consent, sending sensitive info to external server, referencing variables that are undefined or improperly assigned (e.g., 'roblox_cookie' which is not defined in the code), potential attempt to exfiltrate user data",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing several modules, some for handling cookies, requests, and Discord webhook interactions. It retrieves Roblox cookies from various browsers using browser_cookie3, looking specifically for '.ROBLOSECURITY'. It then validates the cookie by calling Roblox API endpoints. If the cookie is valid, it fetches user info such as UserID, username, Robux balance, account age, creation date, and avatar headshot. Critical data like the cookie and user info are then sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which suggests exfiltration of user credentials and personal data. The presence of obfuscated variable and function names indicates possible malicious intent to hide functionality. Some variables used in the webhook payload are undefined or improperly referenced (e.g., 'roblox_cookie', 'rolimons', 'roblox_profile', etc.), indicating incomplete or malicious code structure. Overall, this code is designed to steal Roblox cookies and user data and transmit them to an external server, which is malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious intent by collecting Roblox cookies and user information, validating them, and exfiltrating sensitive data to a remote webhook. Obfuscated naming, hardcoded webhook URL, and attempts to access user cookies without consent strongly suggest malicious behavior intended for unauthorized data harvesting.",
