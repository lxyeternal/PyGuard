  "purpose": "The script appears to collect Roblox cookies from various browsers, verify the cookie validity, retrieve user information from Roblox, and send this data to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (firefox, chrome, edge, opera, chrome), user input via cookie extraction functions, external API requests (IP address, Roblox user info).",
  "sinks": "Sending data via HTTP POST to a Discord webhook, including cookies, user information, and potentially sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Extract cookies from browsers -> Validate cookies -> Fetch Roblox user data -> Send data to Discord webhook.",
  "anomalies": [
    "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL in plain text.",
    "Unclear purpose of some variables and functions with obfuscated names.",
    "Attempting to extract Roblox cookies without user consent.",
    "Constructing and sending detailed user info (Roblox ID, username, balance, etc.) to external server.",
    "Potentially exposing Roblox cookies and user information to a third-party webhook."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code gathers Roblox session cookies from multiple browsers, checks their validity with Roblox's API, and retrieves user info like user ID, username, balance, premium status, and account creation date. It then constructs a detailed message containing this data and posts it to a Discord webhook. The use of obfuscated function and variable names suggests an attempt to hide the true purpose. The hardcoded webhook URL and transmission of cookies and user data indicate potential malicious intent, especially since user consent is not obtained and data is sent externally. There are no indications of obfuscated code or malicious payloads like reverse shells or system damage, but the data exfiltration aspect raises significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to exfiltrate Roblox cookies and user information to a Discord webhook without user consent, which constitutes malicious behavior. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs and cookie extraction from browsers further supports this. The overall security risk is high due to data theft potential, although no active malware or destructive actions are present.",
