  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, primarily designed for stealing Roblox user cookies and personal data, validating them, and exfiltrating this information to an external server via a webhook. The obfuscation and incomplete variables further suggest malicious intent aimed at evading detection. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score is justified as approximately 0.85."
