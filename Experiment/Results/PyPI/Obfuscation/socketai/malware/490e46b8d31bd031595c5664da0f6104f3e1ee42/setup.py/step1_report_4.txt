{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package, but includes code that attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to an external IP address.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the base64-encoded string and environment variables; it also reads external network addresses and executes system commands.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes decoded base64 content, which runs potentially malicious shell commands, including network connections and shell spawning.",
  "flows": "The code encodes a reverse shell command in base64, decodes it, and executes it via os.system, creating a source-to-sink flow that leads to a remote connection and potential control of the system.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded IP address and port, encoded command that, when decoded, initiates a reverse shell, and obfuscated class and method names indicating concealment. Use of base64 encoding and dynamic execution is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the 'install' command. During installation, it constructs a reverse shell command pointing to IP 13.93.28.37 on port 1337, encodes this command in base64, and then decodes and executes it via os.system. The reverse shell code, which spawns a bash shell and connects back to the specified IP, is a common tactic for remote code execution and unauthorized access. The hardcoded IP and port, combined with the encoding and execution, strongly indicate malicious intent to establish unauthorized control of the system upon installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior intended to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote host during package installation. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malware, posing a severe security risk.",
