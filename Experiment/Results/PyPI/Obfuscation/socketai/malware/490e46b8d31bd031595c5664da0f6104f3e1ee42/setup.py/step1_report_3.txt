{
  "purpose": "Custom setup script that modifies the installation process to include malicious network activity and code execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded IP address and port, and executes a base64-decoded command via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded base64 string, which runs a potentially malicious shell command.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded IP and port -> base64-encoded command -> decoding -> execution via os.system",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, base64 encoding of command, network connection to external IP, reverse shell payload, executed during installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command class that, during installation, constructs a reverse shell payload. The payload connects to external IP 13.93.28.37 on port 1337, and spawns a bash shell. The command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via os.system, enabling remote command execution. The code does not sanitize input and relies on hardcoded network parameters, indicating malicious intent. The use of dynamic code execution and network connection during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains clear malicious behavior by establishing a reverse shell connection during package installation. It is highly likely to be malicious, aiming to compromise systems where the package is installed.",
