{
  "purpose": "Setup script that installs a Python package with a custom install command potentially executing malicious code.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, encodes and decodes base64 strings, and constructs a command string for execution.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a decoded base64 string which contains a reverse shell payload, establishing a network connection to an external IP.",
  "flows": "The custom install command encodes a reverse shell payload in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system, connecting to external server at 13.93.28.37:1337.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP address and port, base64 encoding of a command that spawns a reverse shell, obfuscated class and method names, and use of os.system with decoded payload are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of 'install' with a custom 'VyVeZjFpWgmwZCwfSEInwBZRyjivZSMM' method that runs during installation. It constructs a reverse shell command targeting IP 13.93.28.37 on port 1337, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it with os.system. This behavior indicates an attempt to establish unauthorized remote access during package installation, which is malicious. The obfuscated class and method names further suggest concealment. The payload's intent is to connect to an external server and spawn a shell, representing a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, specifically a reverse shell payload executed during package installation. The hardcoded IP, port, obfuscation, and execution of a base64-encoded command all point to malicious intent. It is highly dangerous and should not be used.",
