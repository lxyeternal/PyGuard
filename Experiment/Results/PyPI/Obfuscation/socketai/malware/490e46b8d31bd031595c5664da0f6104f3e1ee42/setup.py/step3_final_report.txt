{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup command that, during installation, executes a reverse shell payload connecting to IP 13.93.28.37 on port 1337, indicating malicious backdoor behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded IP address and port, constructs a reverse shell command, and encodes it in base64.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decoded base64 command via os.system, which spawns a reverse shell connecting to an external server.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it during setup, establishing remote access.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, hardcoded external IP and port, base64 encoding of malicious payload, execution during installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated custom install class that, during setup, constructs a reverse shell command targeting a specific IP and port. This command is base64-encoded, then decoded and executed via os.system, resulting in a remote shell connection. The obfuscation and hardcoded parameters strongly suggest malicious intent. The payload's behavior matches typical backdoor activity, allowing remote control of the compromised system. The code's structure and execution flow confirm it as malicious, with high severity due to potential remote code execution and system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, implementing a reverse shell backdoor during installation. It uses obfuscation and hardcoded parameters to conceal its intent, posing a severe security threat. The malware score is 1, obfuscation score approximately 0.9, and security risk score 1, all consistent with the malicious behavior.",
