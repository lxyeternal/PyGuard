  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to execute a reverse shell payload during installation.",
  "sources": "The 'install' method in the custom class, particularly the base64-encoded command and the socket connection details.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded base64 command, socket connection to external IP, spawning a bash shell.",
  "flows": "The install method constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, decodes it, and executes it via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded external IP address and port, encoding payload in base64, executing shell commands during setup, unusual class and method naming, obfuscated code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command that, during installation, constructs a reverse shell payload targeting IP 13.93.28.37 on port 1337. The payload is base64-encoded, then decoded and executed via os.system, resulting in a potential remote access backdoor. The presence of socket code and bash spawning indicates malicious intent. The unusual class and method names, along with obfuscated base64 handling, further suggest malicious obfuscation. This behavior is typical of malicious package supply chain attacks designed to establish remote access during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious reverse shell payload execution embedded within the installation process, representing a high security risk. It is strongly advised not to use or distribute this package.",
