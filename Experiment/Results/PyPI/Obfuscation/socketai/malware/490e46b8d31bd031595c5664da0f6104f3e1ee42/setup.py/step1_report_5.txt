{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that executes a malicious payload during installation.",
  "sources": "The payload is generated and executed within the 'install' class, specifically in the overridden 'VyVeZjFpWgmwZCwfSEInwBZRyjivZSMM' method. It constructs a base64-encoded command that, when decoded, establishes a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sinks": "The decoded command is executed via 'os.system', which runs a shell command that initiates a reverse shell, connecting to an external IP address and port. This is a critical sink that can lead to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Input data is constructed as a hardcoded string, then base64-encoded ('VPQImLeCqSdxlHBadjpxCUgDwTWmLfDh'). During setup, the encoded payload is decoded and piped into 'bash' via 'echo ... | base64 -d | bash', leading to execution of the malicious reverse shell command.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated class and method names. It encodes a reverse shell command and executes it during installation, which is highly unusual and suspicious. The base64 encoding is used to hide the malicious intent. The payload connects to an external server, indicating potential backdoor or remote control behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the 'install' command of setuptools to insert malicious behavior. It constructs a reverse shell command targeting IP '13.93.28.37' on port 1337, encodes it in base64, and then decodes and executes it during package installation. The use of obfuscated identifiers and the payload's nature clearly indicate malicious intent. The code's execution flow involves creating a command string, encoding, and executing it remotely, which is a classic malicious supply chain tactic.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains embedded malicious code that executes a reverse shell connecting to a remote server during installation. The obfuscation and execution method strongly suggest malicious intent. This package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
