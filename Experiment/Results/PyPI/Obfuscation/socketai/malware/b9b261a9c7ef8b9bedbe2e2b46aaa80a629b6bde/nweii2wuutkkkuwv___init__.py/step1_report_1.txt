{
  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from a local module 'src_file' and initialize the 'colorama' library for terminal color handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from .src_file import *' and 'from colorama import *'; 'initialize()' call from 'colorama'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flows from untrusted sources. 'initialize()' configures colorama, no flow of untrusted data to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can be suspicious as it may obscure which components are used, but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic module imports and initialization of the colorama library, which is standard for terminal color management. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior detected. The use of wildcard imports is a poor practice but not malicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple setup snippet for a Python project, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor concern is the use of wildcard import, which can lead to unclear namespace usage but does not indicate malicious intent.",
