{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module 'src_file' and initializes the 'colorama' library, likely for colored terminal output.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'src_file' and the 'colorama' package during import and initialization.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly write or send data to external sources or untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported module and 'colorama' library into the current namespace; the 'initialize()' call sets up 'colorama' for terminal color handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from ... import *' can hide imported names, but this alone is not malicious. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing modules and initializing a library for terminal colors. No external data handling, network communication, or potentially malicious behavior is evident. The use of 'import *' is a known risky pattern for namespace pollution but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing basic setup tasks without suspicious or malicious intent. No malware or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
