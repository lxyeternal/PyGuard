{
  "purpose": "This code performs malicious activities by downloading and executing remote binaries during package installation, indicating a supply chain attack or malware deployment.",
  "sources": "Remote URLs 'https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/c.exe' and 'https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/dgdeskband64.dll' used as sources for downloading files.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded files to disk as 'ComServer.exe' and 'dgdeskband64.dll', then executing 'ComServer.exe' via os.system.",
  "flows": "Download files from URLs -> Save files in temporary directory -> Execute 'ComServer.exe' with os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, suspicious domain names, no validation of downloaded files, immediate execution without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during package installation, downloads two files from suspicious URLs, saves them locally, and executes the executable file without validation. Obfuscated identifiers and remote execution strongly suggest malicious intent. The URLs are non-standard and likely malicious. The pattern matches typical malware or supply chain attack tactics. The code's behavior is consistent with active malicious activity, with no validation or user notification, indicating high risk. The obfuscation further supports malicious concealment. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9-1, obfuscated ~0.8, security risk ~0.9-1) are justified. Given the active download and execution of remote payloads, a malware score of 1 is appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing a supply chain attack by downloading and executing remote binaries without validation. It employs obfuscation and suspicious URLs, posing a high security threat. The scores in the reports are accurate; the malware score should be set to 1 for clarity. Overall, this package should be considered malicious and flagged accordingly.",
