{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom install command for a Python package that downloads and executes potentially malicious files during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from URLs ('https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/c.exe' and 'https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/dgdeskband64.dll') via HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "It writes the downloaded content to files on the filesystem ('ComServer.exe' and 'dgdeskband64.dll') and executes 'ComServer.exe' using os.system.",
  "flows": "URL request -> download file content -> save to disk -> execute 'ComServer.exe' via system command.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads executable and DLL files from suspicious, non-standard domains and executes the downloaded executable during installation. The code uses obfuscated class and function names, likely to evade detection. The URL domains are suspicious and unrelated to legitimate software sources.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to run during package installation, downloading and executing external files from suspicious URLs. It appears to perform malicious actions such as installing a persistent executable and running it immediately. The use of obfuscated class/function names, dynamic download and execution, and questionable URL sources strongly suggest malicious intent. There are no input sanitization or validation mechanisms, and the code actively downloads and executes code from untrusted sources. Overall, this pattern matches common supply chain attack tactics.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It downloads and executes files from untrusted sources during installation, which can compromise the system. The suspicious URLs, obfuscated code, and automatic execution indicate malicious behavior with high confidence.",
