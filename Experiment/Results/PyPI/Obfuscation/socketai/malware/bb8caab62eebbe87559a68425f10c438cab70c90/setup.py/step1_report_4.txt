{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation command to download and execute external files, potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from two URLs ('https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/c.exe' and 'https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/dgdeskband64.dll') using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded data is written to files in a temporary directory and then executed via os.system with 'START ... showdeskband'.",
  "flows": "Input from the URLs flows into files written in a temporary directory, then the executable file (ComServer.exe) is run, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual and suspicious behaviors include downloading executables and DLLs from suspicious domains, executing downloaded files without validation, and obfuscated class and function names. The code uses dynamic download and execution patterns typical of malware. The URL domains are obscure and possibly malicious. The code also writes files to a temp directory with filenames like 'ComServer.exe', which can be used to disguise malicious files.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon installation, downloads an executable and a DLL from a suspicious domain. It saves them into a temporary directory, then executes the executable using 'START' command. The code employs obfuscated class and function names, likely to evade detection. The use of urllib to fetch files from untrusted, suspicious URLs and then executing them indicates malicious intent. No input validation is performed on the downloaded data. The behavior strongly resembles malware, aiming to download and run potentially harmful code during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing external files from suspicious domains during installation, indicating a high likelihood of malware. The obfuscated names and downloading from suspicious URLs suggest malicious intent and potential harm to systems where this package is installed.",
