{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to download and execute external files, potentially maliciously.",
  "sources": "The code reads external data from URLs 'https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/c.exe' and 'https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/dgdeskband64.dll'.",
  "sinks": "Writes downloaded data to local files 'ComServer.exe' and 'dgdeskband64.dll' and executes 'ComServer.exe'.",
  "flows": "External URLs -> Downloaded files -> Saved to local directory -> Execution of 'ComServer.exe'.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obfuscated class and function names, downloads files from suspicious domains, executes downloaded executable, and writes files in temporary directory. No comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that downloads malicious files from suspicious domains, saves them locally, and executes one of the downloaded files. The use of obfuscated names and dynamic URL fetching strongly suggests malicious intent. The execution of downloaded executables without validation is risky and typical of malware. The code does not perform any legitimate setup-related actions besides installing a package, which appears to be a cover for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing files from suspicious domains during installation, indicating it functions as malware. The obfuscated code and direct execution of remote content confirm high malicious intent.",
