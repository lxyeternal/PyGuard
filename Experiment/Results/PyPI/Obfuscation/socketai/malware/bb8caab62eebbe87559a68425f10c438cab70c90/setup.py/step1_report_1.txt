{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes files from remote URLs during package installation.",
  "sources": "Remote URLs in bMXrugHWSoyPCsansMblyaRSBzJGZTCn() function, specifically 'https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/c.exe' and 'https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/dgdeskband64.dll'.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded data to disk as 'ComServer.exe' and 'dgdeskband64.dll', then executing 'ComServer.exe' with system call 'START'.",
  "flows": "Downloads payloads from URLs, saves as files, then executes the .exe file which may execute malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; download URLs suggest possible malicious activity; execution of downloaded file via os.system; no verification of file integrity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, fetches executable and DLL files from suspicious external URLs. These files are saved locally and then run without any validation or user consent. The URLs used are non-standard and imply potential malicious intent, especially given the context of downloading and executing remote binaries during package setup. The obfuscated function and variable names further suggest malicious concealment. The execution of 'ComServer.exe' can potentially run arbitrary malicious code. No safety checks, such as verifying hashes or signatures, are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior: it downloads and executes remote binaries during installation, likely aiming to compromise the system. The use of obfuscated identifiers and remote payloads indicates malicious intent.",
