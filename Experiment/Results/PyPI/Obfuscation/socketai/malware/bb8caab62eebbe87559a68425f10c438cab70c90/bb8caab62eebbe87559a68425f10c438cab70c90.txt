      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing a supply chain attack by downloading and executing remote binaries without validation. It employs obfuscation and suspicious URLs, posing a high security threat. The scores in the reports are accurate; the malware score should be set to 1 for clarity. Overall, this package should be considered malicious and flagged accordingly."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of obfuscated date/time utility functions with minor bugs and no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation may be intentional to hinder readability but does not inherently imply malicious intent. The presence of bugs like 'return ret' suggests incomplete or obfuscated code rather than malicious sabotage."
