{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated script executing encoded code, with multiple utility classes for console manipulation, animations, and text formatting. The primary purpose appears to be running concealed operations possibly involving user interaction and dynamic output.",
  "sources": "Base64-decoded encoded string at the start which is then compiled and executed; input() calls for user data; terminal size and environment variables; external system commands via _system() functions.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically decoded and compiled code; system commands like 'cls', 'clear', and 'title'; print statements for output; input prompts which may be used to gather user data.",
  "flows": "Base64 encoded string is decoded, compiled, and executed; subsequent classes and functions manipulate console output, potentially using user input or terminal size info; functions may generate and output formatted or animated text; some functions accept user input or execute system commands based on user input.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code, especially at the start, decoding to an executable bytecode; dynamic class and function definitions that generate console animations, text formatting, and user prompts; use of external system commands ('cls', 'clear', 'title') in a manner that can influence system state or user experience; presence of non-descriptive variable and class names, suggesting concealment; potential for executing arbitrary code if the decoded payload is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by decoding a base64 string, compiling it, and executing it in an obfuscated manner. The initial payload could contain malicious code, or hidden payloads. Multiple utility classes are defined, providing console manipulation, dynamic text effects, and user interaction features, including animations and input handling. These functions can be used for benign purposes like UI or malicious purposes like data exfiltration or control. The code's structure and variable naming heavily indicate an attempt at concealment, making precise detection of malicious behavior challenging. The presence of functions that execute system commands, perform console animations, and accept user input suggest potential for interactive malicious operations, such as prompting for sensitive info or executing arbitrary commands. Overall, the code's obfuscation and potential for executing hidden payloads elevate the security risk significantly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated, beginning with executing a decoded payload that may contain malicious code. The presence of multiple console manipulation functions and user interaction points indicates potential for malicious activities such as data theft, system control, or concealment of malicious payloads. The code appears intentionally designed to conceal its true intent, warranting high caution. It is recommended not to run this code without further analysis of the decoded payload and its actions.",
