{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated utility and system interaction scripts, likely intended for terminal manipulation, display, and input handling.",
  "sources": "Decoding base64-encoded code executed via exec; imports system, os, sys, threading, and terminal handling functions; reads terminal size, environment variables, and user input.",
  "sinks": "System commands executed via _system() calls, terminal manipulations, and direct user input/output operations; some functions generate dynamic terminal output; potential for controlled user interaction or display obfuscation.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoded code runs at start; system functions are invoked for clearing console, setting window titles, modes, and executing commands; terminal size and cursor visibility influence display functions; input functions read user responses; display functions generate formatted terminal output.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated base64-encoded code executed immediately; extensive functions for dynamic terminal display and cursor control; no explicit hardcoded credentials or backdoors; unconventional class and function names; no network or data exfiltration signals; complex, purpose-specific display logic; no clear malicious behavior in functionality.",
  "analysis": "The initial code decodes and executes a base64-encoded script, which is a common tactic for obfuscation or hiding malicious payloads, but the decoded code appears to be a library of terminal display and control functions, including cursor hiding/showing, clearing, and formatted output. These are typical in terminal-based applications or cheats, not inherently malicious. The code contains numerous functions for visual effects, user input, and terminal size management. There are no signs of network activity, data theft, or system damage. The obfuscation and self-executing decoded code suggest an intent to hide functionality, but the visible code itself is purely UI/terminal management. Overall, it appears to be an obfuscated terminal utility library rather than malware, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily provides obfuscated terminal display and control functions, initiated by executing a base64-encoded script. No network, data exfiltration, or system sabotage signals are present. The obfuscation could be used to hide malicious payloads, but based solely on the visible code, it appears to be a complex terminal UI toolkit, not malicious. Confidence in malicious behavior is low; the overall security risk is minimal but warrants caution due to obfuscation and self-decoding approach.",
