  "purpose": "Static setup configuration for a Python package with an obfuscated name.",
  "sources": "No dynamic input, environment variables, or external data; static parameters in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code execution, network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated package name 'd1v4h3c2almh7fm7', which is unusual but not malicious; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static setup script importing setuptools and calling setup() with fixed parameters. The package name is obfuscated, which could be suspicious but does not imply malicious intent. No dynamic code, external data, or runtime behaviors are present. All reports correctly identify the static nature and lack of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score in some reports (up to 0.8) appears overstated given the benign code; a moderate score (~0.2-0.4) is more appropriate. Malware scores are consistently zero, justified by the absence of malicious behavior. Security risk scores are low (~0.1), reflecting the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The package is a benign, static setup script with an obfuscated name. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation warrants some caution but does not constitute malicious intent. Scores should reflect zero malware probability, moderate obfuscation concern, and low security risk.",
