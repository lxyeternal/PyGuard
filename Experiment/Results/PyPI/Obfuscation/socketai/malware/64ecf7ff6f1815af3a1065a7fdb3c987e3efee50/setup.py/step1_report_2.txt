{
  "purpose": "Define and set up a Python package using setuptools with specific metadata.",
  "sources": "Input data includes static strings for package name, version, license, authors, and keywords.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no dynamic code, external calls, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "The data flows from static inputs in setup() to the package metadata without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual package name 'd1v4h3c2almh7fm7' which appears obfuscated or intentionally random; no dynamic or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define a package with explicit metadata. The package name appears obfuscated but is statically defined. There are no dynamic inputs, no code execution, or network operations. The license is standard, and authorship info is straightforward. The structure is typical for a setup.py file, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration with an unusual package name but no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
