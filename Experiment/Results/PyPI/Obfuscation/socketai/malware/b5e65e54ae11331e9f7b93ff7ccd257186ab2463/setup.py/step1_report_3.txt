{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to perform malicious activities such as establishing a network connection to a remote server and spawning a shell, potentially for remote command execution or backdoor access.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlopen() for fetching data from a suspicious URL, socket connection to IP 134.209.85.64 on port 8080, and os.dup2() calls that redirect standard input/output to the socket.",
  "sinks": "os.dup2() calls redirecting stdin, stdout, stderr to the socket, and pty.spawn('/bin/sh') which spawns a shell, enabling remote command execution.",
  "flows": "The function qEMVREipQeRzzySGWnWrMSDkRdENzjQJ() fetches remote data, opens a socket connection to a remote IP, duplicates socket file descriptor to standard input/output/error, and spawns a shell, creating a backdoor.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated function and variable names, fetches data from a suspicious URL, connects to an IP address rather than a typical host, and establishes a reverse shell without any legitimate purpose or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function that retrieves data from a suspicious URL, then opens a socket connection to an external IP address. It duplicates the socket file descriptor to standard input, output, and error streams, and finally spawns a shell process. This pattern indicates a likely attempt to establish a remote backdoor or remote code execution channel. The use of obfuscated names suggests concealment. The setup with urllib, socket, os, and pty is typical in malicious reverse shell implementations. The setup() function configures a Python package with a fake name and version, but the primary malicious activity is embedded within the custom install class and function, which executes upon installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior, including establishing a reverse shell connection to a remote server, redirecting I/O streams, and fetching data from a suspicious URL. The obfuscated variable names and the network activity strongly suggest an intent to compromise the host system or create a backdoor.",
