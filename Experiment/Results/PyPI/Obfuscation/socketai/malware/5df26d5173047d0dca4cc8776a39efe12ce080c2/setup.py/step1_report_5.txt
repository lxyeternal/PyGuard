{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it includes a custom installation class that executes potentially malicious network code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly, but constructs a command string that is then executed via os.system. The command string is built from hardcoded variables and then base64-decoded and executed.",
  "sinks": "The final constructed command is decoded from base64 and piped into bash for execution, which can execute arbitrary code received over the network connection.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a network connection string using hardcoded IP and port, encodes a Python reverse shell payload in base64, decodes it at runtime, and executes it via bash, establishing a reverse shell connection to the specified IP and port.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class names, the reverse shell payload embedded in the setup script, use of base64 encoding to hide malicious commands, and execution of network code during package installation are highly unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, when invoked, constructs a reverse shell payload that connects back to a specified IP and port. It encodes this payload with base64, then decodes and executes it during the installation process, effectively installing backdoor functionality into the package. The approach of embedding such code inside a setup script is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code does not perform any benign or intended setup actions beyond this, and the obfuscation and network activity are typical of malicious sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior—an embedded reverse shell payload that activates during package installation, enabling remote access to the host system. It appears designed to sabotage or compromise systems where the package is installed.",
