{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during the installation process, executes a base64-encoded command intended to open a reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port.",
  "sources": "The code reads the network IP (ZzHhGPGPoaqCeWuezOxVAUEFBLmAbWlO) and port (ekqMgzBIsoCRifrcPaZNSvAXJwMZVzrV) variables, and the base64-encoded command string (qNAFRxgTfZscmLcnPUagwnikHXyeeqUi).",
  "sinks": "Execution of os.system with the decoded command, which initiates a reverse shell, providing remote control over the system.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, decodes it during runtime, and executes it via os.system, creating a source-to-sink flow that leads to remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and method names are obfuscated, unusual variable naming is used, and the command executed is a reverse shell payload which is highly suspicious. The code hides malicious intent within an encoded string, which is a common obfuscation technique.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a custom install class with an overridden method. This method, when invoked, sets up a reverse shell connection to a specified IP (13.93.28.37) on port 8888. The reverse shell command is constructed as a string, then base64-encoded, and finally decoded and executed with os.system. The obfuscation of class names, method names, and variable names, combined with the embedded reverse shell payload, strongly indicates malicious intent. This payload allows remote attackers to gain control over the host system during package installation, representing a significant security threat.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code designed to establish a reverse shell to a remote server during installation. The obfuscation, embedded network connection, and command execution clearly indicate malicious behavior, posing a high security risk. The package should be considered compromised and unsafe to use.",
