{
  "purpose": "Define a custom install command that executes a reverse shell connection to a specified IP address and port during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded IP address ('13.93.28.37') and port (8888), and encodes a command string intended to establish a reverse shell connection.",
  "sinks": "The code executes a base64-decoded shell command via os.system, which runs a Python one-liner to connect back to the specified IP and port, spawn a shell, and redirect I/O streams.",
  "flows": "The hardcoded IP and port are embedded in a Python command string, which is base64-encoded. This encoded string is decoded and executed through os.system, leading to a reverse shell connection.",
  "anomalies": "The class name is obfuscated, the code uses dynamic string formatting for network details, encodes a potentially malicious shell command, and executes it during package installation. The reverse shell code is embedded directly into the setup script, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the install method. It constructs a reverse shell command to connect to a specific IP address and port, encoding this command in base64, and then executing it during the setup process. This behavior indicates an attempt to establish a remote backdoor when the package is installed, which is malicious. The obfuscated class name and the embedding of reverse shell code within the setup script are typical indicators of malicious intent or sabotage. The command, once decoded and executed, provides remote shell access, posing significant security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains embedded malicious behavior designed to create a reverse shell connection during package installation. It is highly suspicious and could be used for unauthorized remote access or system compromise. The obfuscated class name and the encoded command further support the malicious intent.",
