{
  "purpose": "This code attempts to modify the installation process to execute a malicious reverse shell connection during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, socket connection parameters, and executes a system command via os.system().",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing a base64-decoded bash command that establishes a reverse shell connection to an external server.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, and executes it via os.system(), connecting to external IP 13.93.28.37 on port 8888.",
  "anomalies": "The class name is obfuscated; it constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it with base64, and executes it, which is unusual for a package setup script. The code directly embeds external IP and port. It uses base64 encoding to hide malicious intent. The code modifies environment variables (HISTFILE) to hide activity.",
  "analysis": "The script subclasses the install command from setuptools to inject malicious behavior during package installation. It constructs a reverse shell command that connects to an external server, encodes it in base64, and executes it via os.system, enabling remote code execution. The use of obfuscated class names and encoding techniques indicates malicious intent. The IP address and port suggest an attacker-controlled server. Overall, the code’s purpose is to establish a reverse shell without user consent, which is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious; it covertly executes a reverse shell upon installation, connecting to an external server. This is a clear security threat, constituting malware designed for remote access and control.",
