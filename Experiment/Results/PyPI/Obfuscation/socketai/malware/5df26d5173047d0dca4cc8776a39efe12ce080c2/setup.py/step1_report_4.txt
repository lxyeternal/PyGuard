{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, with a custom installation step that executes a potentially malicious reverse shell command.",
  "sources": "The code reads the base64-encoded command string, the shell command components, and environment variables. It also accesses socket and os modules.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'os.system' with decoded base64 command, and socket connection code within the custom install method.",
  "flows": "The setup script calls the custom install method, which constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system, establishing a remote connection.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class contains code that constructs a reverse shell payload, encodes it, and executes it during package installation. Use of obfuscated variable names and base64 encoding for the command suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and install modules, then defines a class with an obfuscated name that inherits from install. Inside the overridden 'tAlCUXnduTXBNZbbnRfstvNzKZbwqIRr' method, it executes a network-based reverse shell by constructing a command string that connects to a specific IP and port, then encodes it in base64, and executes the payload via os.system. The use of base64 encoding and environment variable manipulation indicates an attempt to hide malicious behavior, specifically establishing a remote shell when the package is installed. The IP address and port are hardcoded, further confirming malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains code that executes a reverse shell during installation, which is malicious behavior. The obfuscation and encoding techniques support this assessment. Overall, this package is designed to establish unauthorized remote access upon installation.",
