  "purpose": "Import statements for 'vidstream' multimedia streaming and audio modules, likely for real-time communication or streaming application.",
  "sources": "Module import statements from 'vidstream.streaming' and 'vidstream.audio' libraries.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution paths; only static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a third-party library 'vidstream', which appears to be a legitimate multimedia streaming package. There is no code execution, data handling, network activity, or embedded secrets. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0-0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of these imports. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident, and the code's intent seems to be setting up a streaming application. The risk remains minimal unless these modules are misused in a larger context, but based solely on this snippet, the risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with only import statements from a legitimate library. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code snippet. No further action is necessary.",
