  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as merely importing classes from the 'vidstream' library, with no execution, data flow, or network activity shown.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, indicating no malicious behavior detected or claimed.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal concern based solely on import statements.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippet only contains import statements; there are no signs of data handling, network activity, or code execution.\n- The 'vidstream' library appears to be a legitimate multimedia streaming library, with no evidence of malicious intent in these snippets.\n- Since no actual logic, network connections, or data processing is present, the risk of malicious activity is negligible.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- The malware scores are appropriately set at 0 across all reports, consistent with the lack of malicious indicators.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct given the clear import statements.\n- The security risk scores are very low, which is justified.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- While the reports are accurate for this snippet, they do not account for how these imports are used in the larger application. If later code dynamically loads or executes code based on these modules, the risk could increase.\n- Without seeing usage, it's impossible to fully assess whether these modules could be exploited or used maliciously.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet.\n- The scores are reasonable given the context.\n- No changes are necessary based on this fragment alone.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just because it's an import statement; actual risk depends on usage)\n\n**Final note:** While the current code appears benign, vigilance is necessary when integrating these modules into larger systems, especially if dynamic code execution or network operations are involved later.",
