  "purpose": "The code imports classes related to streaming video and audio functionalities from the 'vidstream' library, likely for establishing streaming servers and clients.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'vidstream.streaming' and 'vidstream.audio', which load classes for streaming server and client functionalities.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in the provided code; it only imports modules without executing or passing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present in the code snippet; it only imports classes, so no source-to-sink data flow can be established.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes for streaming server and client functionalities from a third-party library 'vidstream'. There are no function calls, data processing, or network operations shown. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident based on these imports alone. Without additional code demonstrating usage, there is no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is limited to importing classes for streaming and audio functionalities, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. It appears to be standard library usage without any malicious or suspicious activity.",
