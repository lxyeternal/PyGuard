  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of import statements from the 'vidstream' library.\n   - There are no function calls, data processing, network activity, or embedded secrets.\n   - The code snippets are just module imports, which are benign by themselves.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is only importing modules.\n   - No logical flaws or suspicious reasoning are evident.\n   - The conclusions correctly state that there is no malicious activity based solely on these snippets.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - Security risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the context.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), reflecting certainty that these snippets are benign.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code only contains import statements, there's no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The assessments are appropriate; no elevated risk is indicated.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n   - There is no evidence of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that no malicious activity can be inferred from these import statements alone.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the findings and the code snippets.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code snippets are benign, consisting solely of import statements.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are evident.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to the possibility of later code execution, but not justified here)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on these snippets, there is no evidence of malware or security risks. The only concern would be if this import code is part of a larger, malicious application, but from what is provided, it appears benign.",
