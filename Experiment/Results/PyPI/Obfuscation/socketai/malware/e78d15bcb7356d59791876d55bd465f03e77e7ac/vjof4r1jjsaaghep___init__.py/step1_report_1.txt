  "purpose": "Import statements for a video streaming library, likely intended for multimedia communication or streaming applications.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'vidstream.streaming' and 'vidstream.audio' modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or actions; the code only imports classes.",
  "flows": "No execution or data flow present; only imports are shown, so no source-to-sink flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a video streaming library. It does not include any logic, data handling, or network activity. No input sources or potential data leaks are present in this snippet. Without additional context or code execution, it is not possible to identify malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code only imports modules related to video and audio streaming functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within these import statements. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low based on this fragment alone.",
