{
  "purpose": "The code constructs a URL from obfuscated variables, fetches remote code via requests, writes it to 'qrcodegen.py', and executes it immediately during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated variables used to dynamically construct the URL; requests.get to fetch remote code.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'qrcodegen.py'; subprocess.check_call to execute the fetched code.",
  "flows": "Variables assemble URL -> requests.get fetches code -> code written to file -> subprocess executes the code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable names; dynamic URL construction; remote code fetch and execution during setup; no verification of fetched code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs remote code fetching and execution during installation, constructed from obfuscated variables, which is a classic malicious pattern. The obfuscation and dynamic URL further hide malicious intent. All reports correctly identify this pattern. The behavior poses a high security risk, with potential for system compromise. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9-1.0, security risk ~0.9-1.0, obfuscation ~0.8-0.9) are justified given the severity. The code lacks any verification of fetched content, increasing danger. Overall, the pattern indicates a supply chain attack vector, and the package should be flagged as malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious and malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during setup. The obfuscation and dynamic URL construction serve to hide this activity. The high malware and security risk scores are justified and should be maintained at maximum levels. This package is unsafe and should be considered malicious.",
