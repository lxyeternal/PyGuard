  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious and malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during setup. The obfuscation and dynamic URL construction serve to hide this activity. The high malware and security risk scores are justified and should be maintained at maximum levels. This package is unsafe and should be considered malicious."
