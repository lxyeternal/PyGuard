{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup script for a Python package, with an embedded class that downloads and executes a script from an external URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The URL constructed from obfuscated variables and fetched using requests.get, specifically the variable PEbBRFfaRYemHVXQRWxtsUCUUFMGvgsn, which is dynamically built from multiple string parts.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded content is written to 'qrcodegen.py' and then executed via subprocess.check_call, which runs the script in the current Python environment.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a URL from obfuscated string variables, fetches data from that URL, writes it to a local file, and executes it immediately.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic URL construction, fetching remote code, and executing it directly without validation. The code downloads and executes code from an external source during setup, which is highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a custom install command class. Within this class, it constructs a URL dynamically from obfuscated strings, which likely resolve to a remote domain and path. It fetches data from this URL, writes the data to 'qrcodegen.py', and executes it immediately. The setup function configures the package with dependencies and installation options, but the embedded code's behavior of fetching and executing remote code during installation is highly suspicious. This pattern is characteristic of malicious supply chain behavior, potentially executing arbitrary code from an attacker-controlled server.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, actively downloading and executing remote code during package installation, which poses a severe security risk. The obfuscation and dynamic code execution strongly indicate malicious intent, likely aiming to compromise systems where the package is installed.",
