      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious obfuscated PowerShell execution during setup, consistent with malware tactics. While definitive payload analysis is lacking, the pattern indicates high potential for malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8, obfuscated ~0.85, risk ~0.8) are justified given the evidence."
