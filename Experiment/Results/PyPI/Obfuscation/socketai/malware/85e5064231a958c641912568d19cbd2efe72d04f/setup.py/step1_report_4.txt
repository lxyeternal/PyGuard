{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with an embedded obfuscated PowerShell command.",
  "sources": "The script reads the filesystem to check for 'tahg', and executes a PowerShell command via subprocess if the directory does not exist.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes obfuscated PowerShell code, which could perform malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the script triggers the PowerShell command; data from the filesystem check flows into the decision point, then the command executes as a sink.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated PowerShell command encoded in Base64, dynamic execution of potentially malicious code, and silent failure handling without logs. The script attempts to run hidden PowerShell commands possibly for malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'distutils' for package setup, which is standard. It then attempts to import 'subprocess' and 'os' modules. It checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists; if not, it runs an obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags. The command is Base64-encoded, which is commonly used to conceal malicious code. The execution is silent (exceptions caught and ignored). The setup function defines package metadata but is unlikely to be suspicious by itself. The obfuscation and hidden execution of PowerShell code indicate malicious intent or sabotage, potentially to execute hidden malicious scripts or download payloads without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell command execution triggered when a specific directory is absent. This behavior suggests malicious intent, likely for covert activities such as system compromise, data exfiltration, or executing hidden malicious payloads. The rest of the setup code is benign but appears to serve as a cover or to avoid raising suspicion.",
