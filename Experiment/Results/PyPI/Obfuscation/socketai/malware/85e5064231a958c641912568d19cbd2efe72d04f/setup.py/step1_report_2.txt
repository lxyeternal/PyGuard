{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with metadata and attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the existence check for the directory 'tahg' and the embedded PowerShell encoded command string.",
  "sinks": "The embedded PowerShell command is executed via subprocess.Popen, which can potentially be used to run malicious code or perform unwanted actions.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code runs the PowerShell command (source) through subprocess.Popen (sink), which executes a potentially malicious payload.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded in Base64, which is often used to obfuscate malicious commands. The command is executed in a hidden window with no window style, typical for stealthy operations. The setup call is straightforward and legitimate-looking, but the prior command execution is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports distutils for package setup and attempts to import subprocess and os modules. It checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg'. If not found, it runs an encoded PowerShell command in a hidden window, which could be malicious. The setup function defines package metadata with no suspicious content. The use of encoded PowerShell and silent execution suggests an intent to hide malicious activity. The overall structure indicates an attempt to deploy or execute hidden code during setup. No other malicious code or data leakage patterns are observed, but the hidden PowerShell command is a serious concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code has a high likelihood of malicious intent due to the obfuscated PowerShell execution, which could execute harmful commands. The package setup appears legitimate but is likely used as a vector for executing malicious payloads during installation.",
