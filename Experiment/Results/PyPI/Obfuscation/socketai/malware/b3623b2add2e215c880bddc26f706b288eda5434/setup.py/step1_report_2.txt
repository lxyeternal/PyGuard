{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information, uptime, and network details, then send this data to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads system uptime from '/proc/uptime', gathers platform and IP information, and receives input via socket functions.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data over a socket connection to an external IP address ('134.209.85.64' on port 9090).",
  "flows": "System info and uptime are gathered, formatted, and transmitted through a socket connection to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, code that collects system info and immediately transmits it without user consent, and a hardcoded IP address in the code. Use of socket to send data externally is suspicious, especially since it occurs during package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that reads system uptime and gathers platform details, formats this info, and transmits it to an external server via socket. The function is invoked during package installation, which could indicate malicious intent to collect system data covertly. Variable names are obfuscated, which suggests an attempt to hide functionality. The external IP and port are hardcoded, and data is sent without any user interaction or permissions, which raises suspicion. No other malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration from sensitive sources or execution of malicious commands are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script covertly collects system information and sends it to an external server during installation, indicating malicious or at least suspicious activity. The obfuscation and network activity point toward potentially malicious intent, likely aiming at unauthorized system data collection.",
