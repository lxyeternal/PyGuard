{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system uptime and OS information and send it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system uptime from '/proc/uptime', accessing platform and socket information, and hostname resolution.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to IP '134.209.85.64' on port 9090 and sending system info data.",
  "flows": "Collects system info -> formats data -> opens socket connection -> sends data to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution with imported modules within functions, and immediate network connection during package installation are suspicious. No credentials are hardcoded, but the active network transmission and obfuscated naming are concerning.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that reads system uptime from '/proc/uptime', processes it to compute hours, and gathers OS details. It then connects to a specific IP address over TCP port 9090 and transmits the collected data. The function is called during the installation process of the package, which is unusual and potentially malicious. Variable names are obfuscated, and the code is designed to run automatically on installation without user consent, indicating possible malicious intent to exfiltrate system info. No malicious payloads such as data theft, backdoors, or destructive actions are present beyond data transmission. The code’s structure suggests an attempt to mask intent and perform covert communication during package install.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly collects system information and transmits it to an external server during package installation, indicating malicious behavior and potential data exfiltration. Its obfuscated style and network activity without user consent are highly suspicious.",
