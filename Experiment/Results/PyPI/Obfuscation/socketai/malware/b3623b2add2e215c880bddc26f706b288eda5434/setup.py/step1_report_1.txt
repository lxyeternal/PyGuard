{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather system information and uptime, then send it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads '/proc/uptime' for system uptime; uses socket to get hostname and IP address; imports platform for system details.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over a socket connection to IP '134.209.85.64' on port 9090.",
  "flows": "Reads system info from files and modules, constructs a string with uptime and system details, then transmits it via socket to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; hardcoded IP address and port; direct socket connection during package installation; no clear benign purpose for data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code reads system uptime from '/proc/uptime', constructs a string with system info, and immediately connects to a remote server to send this data during package installation. The data transmission is concealed within a function with obfuscated name, indicating potential malicious intent to exfiltrate system information. The remote server IP is hardcoded, and the code executes upon installation, which is unusual for benign packages. The purpose appears to be unauthorized data collection or potential backdoor activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting system details and exfiltrating them to a remote server during package installation. The obfuscated naming and hardcoded IP address increase suspicion. Overall, this indicates malicious intent related to data exfiltration.",
