{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather system information and send it to a remote server during installation of a Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads '/proc/uptime' for system uptime, uses 'platform' module for system details, and 'socket' module for network info. The data is collected within 'LubXuzuKJfaqkbYArlioXYmCUGTPZvNP' function called during package install.",
  "sinks": "Network socket connection to '134.209.85.64' on port 9090 and sending encoded system info string.",
  "flows": "Source: '/proc/uptime' and system modules -> Function 'LubXuzuKJfaqkbYArlioXYmCUGTPZvNP' -> Network socket connect -> Data sent to remote IP.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, hardcoded IP address and port, code executes during package installation, and the purpose of exfiltrating system info is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines obfuscated functions and variables to hide their purpose. It reads system uptime from '/proc/uptime' and gathers system info such as OS version and hostname. It then establishes a socket connection to a remote server (134.209.85.64:9090) and sends the collected info. This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration, possibly malicious, especially since it activates during package installation, which could be used as a vector for malware or unauthorized tracking. The code does not perform any other apparent malicious activities like damaging files or mining cryptocurrency but its stealthy behavior raises concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly collects system information and transmits it to an external server during package installation, indicating malicious or surveillance intent. The obfuscation and hardcoded IP address suggest malicious behavior.",
