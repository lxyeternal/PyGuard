{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information and uptime, then send this data over a network connection to a specific IP address. It also defines a custom installation command for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads from /proc/uptime, platform module for system info, socket.gethostbyname for IP details",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to 134.209.85.64:9090 and data sent via socket.send()",
  "flows": "System info and uptime -> formatted string -> socket.send() over network",
  "anomalies": "Code opens a socket connection to an external IP address and transmits system data without user consent. The IP address and data transmission are suspicious; code runs during package installation. No user input or validation is present. Hardcoded IP and port indicate potential data exfiltration or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system uptime and platform information. It then establishes a TCP socket connection to a remote server at 134.209.85.64:9090 and sends the gathered system information. The data transmission occurs during the package's installation process via a custom install class, which could be used maliciously to silently exfiltrate host system details. There are no obfuscation techniques, but the behavior of collecting and transmitting system info without user knowledge is suspicious and indicates potential malicious activity. The code does not contain any credential theft, backdoors, or damaging actions but performs unauthorized data collection and exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly collecting system information and transmitting it to an external server during package installation. This indicates a potential security risk of data exfiltration without user consent. While no direct malware actions like damaging files or reverse shells are present, the data exfiltration activity is suspicious and warrants caution.",
