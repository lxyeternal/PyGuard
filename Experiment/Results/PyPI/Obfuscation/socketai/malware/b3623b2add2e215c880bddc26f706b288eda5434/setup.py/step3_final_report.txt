{
  "purpose": "The code collects system uptime and system information, then exfiltrates this data to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading '/proc/uptime', gathering system info via 'platform' and 'socket', and executing during the 'install' process.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to '134.209.85.64' on port 9090 where data is sent.",
  "flows": "System info is read, formatted, and sent over the socket connection during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, hardcoded IP address, network activity during install, data exfiltration without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code reads system uptime and info, then immediately establishes a socket connection to transmit this data during package installation. Obfuscation and hardcoded IP suggest malicious intent. The activity is covert and could compromise user privacy. No destructive payloads are present, but the exfiltration behavior is suspicious and aligns with malicious activity. The code's behavior is consistent across reports, with high obfuscation and security concern scores justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during package installation, with obfuscation and hardcoded IP reinforcing suspicion. The activity poses a significant security and privacy risk, warranting high malware and risk scores.",
