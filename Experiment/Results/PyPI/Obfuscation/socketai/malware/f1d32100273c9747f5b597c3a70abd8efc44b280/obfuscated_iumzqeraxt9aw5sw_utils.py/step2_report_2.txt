  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the validity of their conclusions, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies that the code creates asynchronous proxy connections, parses proxy URLs, and uses standard asyncio and python_socks functions. Finds no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code appears legitimate, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid, well-reasoned, and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that user-provided proxy URLs could be exploited if malicious, but no malicious code is present. Notes the potential security concern with untrusted proxy URLs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3 — somewhat high but considering the potential for misuse of untrusted inputs, acceptable.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that dynamic parsing of proxy URLs could be exploited, but no actual malicious code exists.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. The risk score reflects the potential danger of untrusted inputs, but no actual malware is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 2, emphasizes that the code uses untrusted inputs but performs standard proxy connection procedures. Finds no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate given the context.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly points out the standard pattern and potential risk with untrusted proxy URLs, but no malicious code.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, notes reliance on user inputs, standard use of asyncio and python_socks, no malicious behavior. Highlights potential security concerns due to untrusted parameters.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Analysis:** The assessment is accurate; no malware detected, and the risk is mainly from untrusted inputs.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes that the code uses unvalidated proxy URLs and parameters, which could be misused, but no malicious code is evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Analysis:** The conclusion that the code is standard and not malicious is correct. The concern about input validation is valid but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Code validation:** All reports correctly identify that the code performs standard proxy connection procedures.\n- **Malware presence:** None detect any malware or malicious code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated due to reliance on untrusted proxy URLs, but this is typical for such code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a legitimate implementation for establishing proxy connections asynchronously.\n- No malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The main security concern is the potential misuse of untrusted proxy URLs, which is a common issue in proxy-related code but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### Recommended scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 — reflects the potential misuse of untrusted inputs but not an inherent security flaw.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments, and no significant changes are necessary.**",
