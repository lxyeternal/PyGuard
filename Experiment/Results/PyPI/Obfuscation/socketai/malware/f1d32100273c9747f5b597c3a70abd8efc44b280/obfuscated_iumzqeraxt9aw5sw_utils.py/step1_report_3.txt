{
  "purpose": "Establish proxy-enabled network connections asynchronously, either by opening a raw socket connection or a protocol-based connection.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as proxy_url, host, port, username, password, and kwargs for connection details.",
  "sinks": "asyncio.open_connection and loop.create_connection where the socket is used to establish network connections; potential use of untrusted proxy URLs.",
  "flows": "proxy_url parsed into proxy parameters -> Proxy.create() -> proxy.connect() -> socket -> open_connection or create_connection with socket -> network connection established.",
  "anomalies": "Use of parse_proxy_url to dynamically determine proxy parameters from user-supplied URLs; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; standard async connection pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two asynchronous functions for creating network connections through proxies. It uses the python_socks library to parse proxy URLs and establish connections via SOCKS5 or other proxy types. The functions handle user-supplied proxy URLs and connection parameters, dynamically configuring proxy settings. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. The code simply facilitates proxy connections with user-provided parameters and does not perform any hidden or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, providing proxy connection capabilities without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The handling of proxy URLs and connection creation is standard and safe. No malicious behaviors or security risks are detected based on this code fragment.",
