  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for establishing proxy connections asynchronously. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The primary security concern is the handling of untrusted proxy URLs, which does not imply malicious intent but warrants caution. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."
