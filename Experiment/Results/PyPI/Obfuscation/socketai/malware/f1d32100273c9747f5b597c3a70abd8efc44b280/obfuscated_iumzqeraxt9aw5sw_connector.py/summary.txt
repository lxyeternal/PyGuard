  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious implementation of proxy connectors supporting SOCKS proxies and chaining. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present. The minor bug regarding the uninitialized 'loop' attribute should be addressed for robustness but does not impact security. Overall, the code poses no supply chain security risk and is safe for use."
