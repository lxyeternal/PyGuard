{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports components related to SOCKS proxy support for aiohttp, including error handling, proxy information, connection utilities, and deprecated classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'python_socks' and local module files (.connector, .utils, ._deprecated). No external data input handling is present.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily imports and re-exports classes and functions without processing untrusted data or executing external commands.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code does not include any data flow logic or processing of untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code is straightforward, mainly import/export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to set up module-level constants and imports for a SOCKS proxy package, including error classes and connection utilities. There is no evidence of data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The imported components suggest functionality for proxy handling, but the code itself contains no input handling, network activity, or sensitive operations. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, serving to organize and expose the module's API.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a Python proxy package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily imports and re-exports classes and functions without performing any operations that could pose security threats.",
