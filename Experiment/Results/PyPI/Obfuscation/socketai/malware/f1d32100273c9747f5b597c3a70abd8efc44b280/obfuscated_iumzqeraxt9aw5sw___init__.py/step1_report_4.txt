{
  "purpose": "This code defines module metadata, imports specific classes and functions related to proxy handling, and sets up exports for an aiohttp socks proxy library.",
  "sources": "Module metadata (__title__, __version__), imported modules (python_socks, internal connector, utils, deprecated), and their components.",
  "sinks": "Exports defined in __all__, no direct data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of module, import statements, and export definitions; no runtime data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Imports are from standard libraries or known external modules; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static metadata and import statements for a proxy-related library. All imported modules appear to be standard, and the exported symbols are consistent with library setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package setup.\n\nNo suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activities are present. The imports and exports are consistent with a library providing proxy connection functionalities.\n\nGiven the lack of runtime code, input handling, or suspicious constructs, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for a Python package related to proxy handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
