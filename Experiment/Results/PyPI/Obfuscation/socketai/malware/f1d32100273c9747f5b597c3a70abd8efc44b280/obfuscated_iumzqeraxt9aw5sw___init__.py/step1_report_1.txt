{
  "purpose": "The code defines module metadata, imports exceptions and classes related to proxy handling, and specifies the public API of the module.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'python_socks', relative imports from '.connector', '.utils', and '._deprecated', as well as module metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network connections, or data processing points are visible; the code only performs imports and defines exports.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely organizes imports and exports without executing any logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various exception classes and functions from a third-party library (python_socks) and local modules for proxy handling. It then defines __all__ for API exports. There are no data processing, network connections, or dynamic code execution present. The structure and content are typical for a Python module meant for proxy management, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a straightforward module setup with no malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly imports necessary classes and functions for proxy operations and defines the module's API.",
