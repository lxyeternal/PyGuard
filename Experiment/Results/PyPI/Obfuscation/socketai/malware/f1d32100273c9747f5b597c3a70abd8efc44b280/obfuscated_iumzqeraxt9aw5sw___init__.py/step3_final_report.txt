  "purpose": "Module initialization and API export setup for the aiohttp-socks package, importing proxy-related classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'python_socks' and internal modules, defining __all__.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network activity, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Static import and export; no runtime data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup, consisting solely of import statements, metadata definitions, and export specifications. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic operations. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present. The code's simplicity and static nature strongly suggest benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module initialization file with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
