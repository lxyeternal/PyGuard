{
  "purpose": "Provides custom aiohttp proxy connectors supporting single and chained proxies, parsing proxy URLs, and establishing connections through proxies.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parsing via parse_proxy_url, user-supplied proxy configuration parameters, external proxy creation functions.",
  "sinks": "Proxy connection establishment, transport layer setup, no untrusted data sinks or data exfiltration points evident.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL parsing -> Proxy object creation -> Proxy connection -> Transport and protocol setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of NoResolver disables DNS resolution, which could be exploited if combined with malicious proxy URLs, but appears to be an intentional design choice for controlled environments.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard proxy connection handling with support for proxy chaining. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. Proxy credentials are supplied externally, and the use of NoResolver is deliberate. No malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows are detected. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified, considering potential misuse if untrusted proxies are used, but this is inherent to proxy configuration code. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting the code's clarity and benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of aiohttp proxy connectors with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
