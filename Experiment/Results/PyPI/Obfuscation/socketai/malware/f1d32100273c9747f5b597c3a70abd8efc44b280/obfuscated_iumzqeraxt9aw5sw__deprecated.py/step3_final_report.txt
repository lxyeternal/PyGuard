{
  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper around SOCKS proxy handling, deprecating an older connector class in favor of a new one, and defines constants for SOCKS versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters during class initialization and method calls, but does not perform network input/output or handle untrusted data directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks within this code snippet; it does not process or output untrusted data or perform network operations itself.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves class instantiation and method calls for proxy configuration, with no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with deprecation warnings and class inheritance. No obfuscated or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple wrapper around a proxy library, with no network activity or data processing. The reported 'Empty response' errors are external network issues, not caused by this code. No security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are inconsistent with the code's nature; they should be very low or zero. The lack of detailed context in the reports prevents identifying actual security issues. Overall, the code appears secure and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not contain malicious or insecure elements. The 'Empty response' errors reported are likely external network or configuration issues unrelated to the code itself. Therefore, the malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score very low (~0.1), reflecting the absence of evidence for security concerns.",
