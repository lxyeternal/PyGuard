  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs standard proxy connection setup without malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to untrusted input handling, which is typical for such utility functions. No evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities is present."
