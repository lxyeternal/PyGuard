{
  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous functions to establish network connections via SOCKS proxies, supporting proxy URL parsing, credential handling, and connection creation.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL input, host and port parameters, optional credentials, and proxy configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection established through proxy, used by asyncio's open_connection or create_connection functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (proxy_url, host, port, credentials) are parsed and validated -> proxy object created -> socket connection established via proxy -> connection returned to caller.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Input validation is standard. No hidden behaviors or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard async proxy connection setup using 'python_socks'. It validates inputs, parses proxy URLs, creates proxy objects, and establishes connections via asyncio. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The code relies on external libraries assumed to be secure. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical proxy connection functions. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs standard proxy connection setup without malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to untrusted input handling, which is typical for such utility functions. No evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities is present.",
