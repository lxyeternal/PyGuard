{
  "purpose": "The code provides asynchronous functions to establish network connections through a SOCKS proxy, supporting both direct and protocol-specific connections.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as proxy URLs, host, port, username, password, and loop from function arguments; also parses proxy URLs for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Uses the parsed proxy data to create and connect via proxy sockets; ultimately opens network connections possibly sending data over the network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (proxy_url, host, port, credentials) are parsed and passed to proxy creation; the proxy connects to target host/port; the connection is used for network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated or unusual code structures; no suspicious network domains or data leakage observed; functions follow standard async patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports trusted libraries and performs expected operations for establishing proxy-based connections using asyncio. It parses proxy URLs, creates proxy objects, and opens network connections. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden behavior. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious URL patterns are present. The code relies on user-provided parameters and established libraries, with no evidence of malicious intent or risky behavior. The overall structure appears legitimate and standard for proxy connection setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of asynchronous proxy connection functions with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not contain backdoors, data theft mechanisms, or malicious network activity. It is safe based on this review.",
