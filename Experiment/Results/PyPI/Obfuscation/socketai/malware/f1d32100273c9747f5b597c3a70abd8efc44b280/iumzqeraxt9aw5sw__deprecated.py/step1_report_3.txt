{
  "purpose": "Defines a deprecated SOCKS proxy connector class that wraps around a generic ProxyConnector, with version options for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, and utility functions for warnings and error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard warnings module, third-party python_socks module, and local connector module; class methods that handle initialization and URL-based creation.",
  "sinks": "Super class methods (super().__init__, super().from_url), warnings.warn, and error class assignments.",
  "flows": "Constructor and from_url method call warnings, then delegate to superclass methods; error classes are assigned from third-party proxy error classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. The warnings are for deprecation notice, not malicious intent. No unusual or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as a wrapper and deprecation notice for an existing proxy connector class, providing version options for SOCKS proxies. It imports necessary modules, defines constants, issues a deprecation warning when instantiating or using from_url, and assigns error classes. There are no input/output handling, no data leaks, no malicious network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code patterns. The code appears to be straightforward and well-structured, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign wrapper for proxy connection handling, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. Its purpose is to guide users away from deprecated classes. No security issues or malware suspected.",
