{
  "purpose": "Provides a SOCKS proxy connector with deprecation warnings, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 versions, delegating connection handling to a parent class.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class constructor parameters, class method 'from_url', and external library functions.",
  "sinks": "super().__init__() and super().from_url() calls, which delegate to parent class methods that handle network connections.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (socks_ver, kwargs, url) flow into class methods and constructors, ultimately delegating to parent class methods for connection setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard deprecation warning, straightforward class inheritance, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines SOCKS version constants, issues deprecation warnings when instantiating or calling 'from_url', and delegates connection logic to a superclass. It imports external modules and assigns error classes. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behavior is evident. The code is a standard wrapper with proper warnings and version handling, with no data leaks or malicious logic. The external dependencies are assumed safe, and the code does not process untrusted data directly. The deprecation warning is standard and benign. Overall, the code is well-structured, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured proxy connector wrapper with deprecation warnings. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
