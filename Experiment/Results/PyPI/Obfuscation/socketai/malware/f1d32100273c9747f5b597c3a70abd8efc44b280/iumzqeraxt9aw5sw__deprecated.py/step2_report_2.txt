  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code snippet.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a wrapper around a proxy connector, with deprecation warnings and support for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident.\n- The code relies on external libraries (`python_socks`) and a local `ProxyConnector`.\n- The deprecation warning is standard practice.\n- The flow involves passing parameters into class constructors and methods, with delegation to superclass methods.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n**Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n- The code appears syntactically correct.\n- No evidence of vulnerabilities, such as injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior.\n- The deprecation warning is appropriate and standard.\n- No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- The use of `super().__init__()` and `from_url()` could process untrusted data if the parent class or external modules are insecure, but this is outside the scope of this snippet.\n- The `ProxyType(socks_ver)` conversion seems safe, assuming `ProxyType` is an enum or similar.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Proxy handling, deprecation warning.\n- No issues found.\n- Malware score: 0, Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0.\n- The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0.\n- The analysis aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Wrapper with deprecation warning.\n- No suspicious code or backdoors.\n- Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0.\n- Correctly identified as benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Proxy class with deprecation warning.\n- No suspicious activity.\n- Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0.\n- The reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: SOCKS proxy class, deprecation warning.\n- No malicious behavior.\n- Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0.\n- Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1), reflecting the minimal security concern due to reliance on external modules and class inheritance, but nothing malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured proxy connector with deprecation warnings.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, considering potential indirect risks from dependencies but not from the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### My recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports and code analysis)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious activity. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
