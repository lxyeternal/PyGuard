{
  "purpose": "Defines a SocksConnector class for handling SOCKS proxy connections, with deprecated warning and proxy type configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports from python_socks, local import of ProxyConnector, class initialization, class method from_url",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; class initialization and method calls are standard",
  "flows": "Initialization flows through SocksConnector, calling super().__init__, and from_url class method calling superclass method",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecation warning; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code found; no obfuscated code or malicious network activity",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing a proxy connector class with deprecation warnings. It imports standard libraries and a local connector class. The class initializes with a SOCKS version, issues a deprecation warning, and calls the superclass constructor accordingly. The from_url class method also issues the same warning and calls the superclass method. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured proxy connector implementation with a deprecated warning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical proxy connector class with deprecation warnings, no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It performs standard class inheritance and method calls, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
