{
  "purpose": "This code defines a deprecated SocksConnector class for managing SOCKS proxy connections, along with related constants and error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (socks_ver, kwargs, url), class instantiation, and method calls. It also imports external modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include super().__init__ calls, class method from_url, and warnings.warn, which could impact control flow or configuration.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (socks_ver, url, kwargs) flow into class initialization and method calls, leading to super().__init__ or from_url, and warnings emitted.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. Use of deprecated warnings and standard class inheritance patterns are normal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines proxy-related classes and constants. It emits deprecation warnings when the SocksConnector class is used, guiding users towards a newer ProxyConnector. It does not handle untrusted input directly, nor does it perform any network or data manipulation. The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscated constructs or suspicious code flow. The use of warnings and class inheritance appears typical for a proxy management library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a proxy connector class with deprecation notices. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured module intended for proxy management.",
