{
  "purpose": "This code defines a SocksConnector class for handling SOCKS proxy connections, along with related constants and warnings about deprecation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, class initializations, and imported modules. It also reads environment variables indirectly through dependencies if used elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connection handling via the ProxyConnector superclass, but no direct untrusted data handling or external system modifications are evident here.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (such as 'socks_ver' and 'url') flow into the constructor and 'from_url' method, which then call the superclass methods. No direct data flows into external systems or sensitive data leaks are visible.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present. The deprecation warning function is standard and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a proxy connection class with version handling and a deprecation warning. It imports external modules that could have their own risks but does not itself perform any unsafe or malicious actions. No suspicious data handling or malicious code execution is observed within this fragment. The deprecation warning is a standard practice. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured implementation of a proxy connector with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of a SOCKS proxy connector with deprecation warnings. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
