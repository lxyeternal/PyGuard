  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a wrapper class for SOCKS proxy handling, with deprecation warnings, version constants, and error class assignments.\n- It imports external modules (`python_socks`) and a local `ProxyConnector`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The logic is straightforward: issuing warnings, forwarding parameters, and calling superclass methods.\n- No data leaks, malicious network activity, or malicious code execution are present.\n- The deprecation warning is standard practice, not malicious.\n- The code appears well-structured and standard for a proxy connector module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n\n- **Presence of code issues:** No, the code does not contain any bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware:** The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** The overall security risk is minimal (0.1), mainly because it involves proxy connection setup, which could be misused if the user supplies malicious URLs or parameters. However, within this code snippet, no direct vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The deprecation warning is standard and not malicious.\n- The use of `super()` and class inheritance is typical.\n- Error classes are correctly assigned from external modules.\n- The code does not process untrusted data directly; parameters are passed to superclass methods, which are not shown here.\n- No evidence of code obfuscation or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1) are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No changes needed for scores based on the provided analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to the nature of proxy configuration, which could be misused if misconfigured, but not inherently risky)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, standard, and well-structured.** No malicious, obfuscated, or security issues are evident from this snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports' conclusions are accurate.  \n- The scores are justified and should remain as-is.  \n- No further action or concern is necessary based on this code review.",
