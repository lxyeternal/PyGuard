  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines SOCKS version constants.\n- Implements a deprecated `SocksConnector` class that wraps around `ProxyConnector`.\n- Issues deprecation warnings when instantiated or when calling `from_url`.\n- Uses `super()` to delegate to the parent class.\n- Assigns error classes from `python_socks`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code is present.\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured proxy connection utility.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- No untrusted data is directly processed in a way that could lead to security issues.\n- The deprecation warning is standard practice, not malicious.\n- No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is present.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The code relies on external libraries (`python_socks`, `connector`) which could have their own vulnerabilities, but within this snippet, no flaws are evident.\n- The deprecation warning is properly issued.\n- The logic flow is straightforward and safe.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports. No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** The reports assign a low risk (~0.1). Given the code's benign nature, this seems appropriate. I agree with the scores, as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a benign wrapper with deprecation warnings.\n- They do not assume malicious intent without evidence.\n- The code's purpose is clear, and no suspicious activity is implied.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** (consistent with the reports and code nature)\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided scores.**  \nThe code is a standard, benign proxy connector with no security risks or malware indications.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe and well-structured.  \n- No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- The low risk score is justified.  \n- No changes needed to the scores.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed review of specific parts or further analysis.",
