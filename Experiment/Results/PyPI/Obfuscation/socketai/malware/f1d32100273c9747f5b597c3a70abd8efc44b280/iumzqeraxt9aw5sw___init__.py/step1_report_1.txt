{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports components related to SOCKS proxy support for the aiohttp library, including imports and public API declarations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from python_socks, local modules (.connector, .utils, ._deprecated). No data input or external data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified. The code does not perform any data output, network connections, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and re-exports components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package module.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and an __all__ declaration to specify public API symbols. There are no dynamic executions, no handling of untrusted input, and no network operations or credential management. The presence of deprecated components is typical for maintaining backward compatibility and does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package module setup for the aiohttp-socks project, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks. It simply organizes and exposes components for the package.",
