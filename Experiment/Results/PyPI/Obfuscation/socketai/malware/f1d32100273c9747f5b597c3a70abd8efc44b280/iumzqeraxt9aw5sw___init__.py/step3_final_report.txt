{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization module, defining metadata and exposing public API components related to SOCKS proxy support.",
  "sources": "The code reads static definitions (__title__, __version__) and imports classes, functions, and error definitions from external and internal modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, network operations, or data leaks present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code imports components and re-exports them via __all__, with no dynamic data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py or module setup file, importing and exposing components without any data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The presence of deprecated components is for backward compatibility and does not indicate malicious intent. All signals point to benign, standard package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All scores should be set to zero, reflecting the absence of threats.",
