{
  "purpose": "This code is a module for handling SOCKS proxy connections in the aiohttp library, providing imports, versioning, and exporting relevant classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from external library 'python_socks', relative imports of connector and utility functions, and version/title variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed; purely defining exports and importing modules.",
  "flows": "Imports from external and internal modules; no data flows involving untrusted input or execution of unverified code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. No hidden or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module metadata (__title__, __version__) and imports specific classes and functions from external and internal modules. It then specifies __all__ to control the public API of the package. The structure and syntax are straightforward, following standard Python practices. No suspicious operations, data handling, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package initialization module, exposing relevant classes and functions for SOCKS proxy support in aiohttp. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are identified.",
