  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code and the context.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It contains only import statements, version/title definitions, and an `__all__` declaration.\n- No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code appears to be a typical `__init__.py` or module setup for a Python package, exposing classes and functions related to SOCKS proxy support.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and standard; it does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic?**  \n  No. The logic is purely about module setup and API exposure.\n\n- **Scores given in reports:**\n  - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or very close to 0.\n  - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n1. **Malware score:**  \n   Since the code only imports and re-exports components, and there's no network activity, code execution, or data handling, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n2. **Obfuscated score:**  \n   The code is transparent, with no obfuscation or unusual constructs, so 0 is correct.\n\n3. **Risk score:**  \n   Given the absence of any suspicious activity, a risk score of 0 or very close to it is appropriate.\n\n4. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n   All claims are based on the static analysis of the code. There are no hidden behaviors or assumptions that could suggest vulnerabilities.\n\n### Consistency and recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code content.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis: the code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is a typical package initialization module, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
