{
  "purpose": "This code defines module metadata, imports specific classes and functions from external and internal modules related to proxy handling, and specifies the public API of the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'python_socks' library, relative imports from local modules (.connector, .utils, ._deprecated).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and exports symbols without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages imports and module metadata. It imports classes related to proxy handling and deprecations, then exposes them via __all__. There are no input sources, data flows, or potential attack vectors identified. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or security-sensitive actions. The structure and content are typical for a Python package’s __init__.py file, aimed at defining public API.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code fragment. It appears to be a standard, benign package initialization file.",
