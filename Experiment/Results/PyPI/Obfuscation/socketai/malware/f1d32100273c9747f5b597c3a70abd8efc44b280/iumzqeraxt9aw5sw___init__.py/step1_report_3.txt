{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public interface and imports for the aiohttp-socks package, facilitating proxy support for aiohttp.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'python_socks', local modules 'connector', 'utils', and deprecated classes.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks where untrusted data flows into potential vulnerabilities; mainly re-exports and imports.",
  "flows": "Imports lead to exports; no data flow from untrusted sources identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets module metadata (__title__, __version__) and re-exports functions and classes from other modules. It imports classes related to proxy handling and network connections, which are standard for a proxy support library. There are no input sources, data processing, or sink points indicating malicious activity. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package initialization and export module with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages imports and public interface exposure.",
