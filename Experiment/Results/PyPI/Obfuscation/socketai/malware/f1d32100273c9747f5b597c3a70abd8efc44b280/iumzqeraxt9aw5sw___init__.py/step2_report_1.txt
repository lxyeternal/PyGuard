  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a module that imports components from external and internal modules and defines the `__all__` variable to specify its public API.\n- No data input/output, network operations, or untrusted data handling are present.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The code structure is typical for a Python package's `__init__.py` or module setup.\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, standard, and without malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- **Presence of deprecated components**: The code imports deprecated classes (`SocksVer`, `SocksConnector`, etc.). While deprecated, their presence alone does not indicate malicious behavior; it is common for libraries to maintain backward compatibility.\n\n- **No dynamic code execution**: The code does not execute any untrusted input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data.\n\n- **No obfuscation or anomalies**: All reports agree on the straightforwardness of the code.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent in the code snippet.\n\n- The only minor point is the inclusion of deprecated components, which might be flagged for cleanup, but this is not a security concern.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware score**: All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate. No malicious behavior is detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score**: All assign 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Risk score**: All assign a very low or zero score, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Confidence levels**: Mostly high (1), indicating certainty in benign assessment.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- No evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or security risks. Therefore, the risk score should remain very low or zero.\n\n### Consistency with the reports:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the detailed reasoning provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nBased on the provided code and reports, I concur that:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThe code is a standard module setup for a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **The code is benign.**  \n- **No changes needed in the scores.**  \n- **All signs point to a well-structured, safe package initialization module.**\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
