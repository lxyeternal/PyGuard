  "conclusion": "The code appears safe with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The current scores are mostly appropriate; adjusting the security risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 across all reports would better match the low observed risk. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified based on the provided analysis."
