  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input parameters, network sources, and data flows within the code.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network connections, file operations, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network or system calls, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected; code appears benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the observations. The security risk scores are slightly high at 0.2, but given the limited context, a conservative adjustment to 0.1 would better reflect the low threat level. Confidence levels are appropriate, with higher confidence where the code is clearly benign. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified, and the reasoning in each report aligns with the scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The current scores are mostly appropriate; adjusting the security risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 across all reports would better match the low observed risk. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified based on the provided analysis.",
