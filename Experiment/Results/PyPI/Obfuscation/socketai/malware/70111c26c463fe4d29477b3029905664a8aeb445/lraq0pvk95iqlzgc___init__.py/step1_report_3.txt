  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but the specific goal cannot be determined definitively from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly visible in the provided code snippet; no functions for reading external input, files, or environment variables are clearly identifiable.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are not explicitly shown; no obvious network connections, file writes, or system modifications are present within the given code segment.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows within the provided code fragment, as no input or output points are demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution, are evident in the snippet. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly; it lacks external data sources, sinks, and complex control flows that could indicate malicious intent. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain threats are detected. The code does not contain any obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or secret data handling. It appears to be benign in scope and functionality.",
