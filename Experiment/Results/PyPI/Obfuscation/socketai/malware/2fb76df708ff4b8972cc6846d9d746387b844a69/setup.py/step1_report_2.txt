{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with metadata and potentially executes a hidden PowerShell command during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading environment (checking if 'tahg' exists), subprocess execution of PowerShell command with encoded payload.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess call that executes a PowerShell encoded command, which could lead to malicious actions or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Check if 'tahg' exists -> Execute PowerShell command via subprocess if not -> Potentially run malicious payload silently.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command executed without validation or explicit purpose; use of try-except without logging; obfuscated command string.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and attempts to run a PowerShell command encoded in base64 when a specific condition (absence of 'tahg' directory) is met. The command is heavily obfuscated, which is suspicious. The subprocess.Popen call is made with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, making the execution hidden. The setup call is standard, but the inclusion of hidden, encoded PowerShell execution raises concern. The try-except blocks suppress errors silently, reducing transparency. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors typical of malicious activity, such as executing hidden payloads, without clear legitimate purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains suspicious behavior with the execution of a hidden, encoded PowerShell command during package setup, indicating potential malicious intent or sabotage. The obfuscated payload and silent error suppression further suggest malicious activity or an attempt to hide malicious code.",
