      "conclusion": "The package is benign in isolation, with red flags related to naming and dependency configuration. No malicious behavior is evident. The scores are appropriate; malware score remains 0, obfuscation is moderate (0.6), and overall security risk is low (~0.45). Further investigation may be warranted if part of a larger supply chain context."

      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to harvest user tokens and credentials from local storage and exfiltrate them to an external server via a webhook. The obfuscation, hardcoded URLs, and data collection methods confirm its malicious nature. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is maximum."
