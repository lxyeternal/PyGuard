  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines package metadata directly.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink exists.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'pjj3fsm4pvwv9jo7' appears as a random string; 'install_requires' contains an empty string, which is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with no dynamic code execution or malicious logic. The random package name and malformed dependencies are suspicious but not malicious. The malware score is correctly 0; obfuscation is moderate due to the package name, and risk is low but warrants caution. No code injection, external data handling, or network activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The package is benign in isolation, with red flags related to naming and dependency configuration. No malicious behavior is evident. The scores are appropriate; malware score remains 0, obfuscation is moderate (0.6), and overall security risk is low (~0.45). Further investigation may be warranted if part of a larger supply chain context.",
