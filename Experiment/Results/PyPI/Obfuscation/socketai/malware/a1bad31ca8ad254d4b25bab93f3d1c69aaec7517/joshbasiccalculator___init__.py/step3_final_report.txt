{
  "purpose": "The code collects tokens and credentials from local application data directories and log files, then exfiltrates this sensitive information via a hardcoded Discord webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables for application data directories, listing files in these directories, reading log files (.log, .ldb), and applying regex patterns to extract tokens or MFA codes.",
  "sinks": "Sending the collected tokens and data through an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Directory listing -> Log file reading -> Regex extraction of tokens -> Data aggregation -> HTTP POST request to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function and variable names, hardcoded webhook URL, extraction of tokens using regex patterns typical for Discord tokens, minimal error handling, and stealthy data exfiltration behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary behavior involves harvesting tokens and credentials from local application data directories, specifically targeting Discord and browser data. It employs obfuscation techniques such as nonsensical function names and hardcoded URLs to evade detection. The regex patterns used are consistent with Discord token formats. The data is then exfiltrated via a network request to a hardcoded webhook URL without user consent. The presence of unused arithmetic functions suggests obfuscation or placeholder code. Error handling is broad and minimal, potentially hiding failures. All these signals point to malicious intent focused on credential theft and privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to harvest user tokens and credentials from local storage and exfiltrate them to an external server via a webhook. The obfuscation, hardcoded URLs, and data collection methods confirm its malicious nature. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is maximum.",
