  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to harvest user tokens and credentials from local storage and exfiltrate them to an external server via a webhook. The obfuscation, hardcoded URLs, and data collection methods confirm its malicious nature. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is maximum."
