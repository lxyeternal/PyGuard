  "conclusion": "The assessments are generally appropriate and well-justified based on the summaries. The only potential refinement is reducing the malware score in Report 3 from 0.3 to 0.2 to better match the evidence. No major revisions are necessary; current scores accurately reflect suspicion levels and code characteristics."
