  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function, but without the actual code provided, it is unclear. Typically, such code could be for data processing, network communication, or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code likely reads input from environment variables, user input, or external files, depending on its design. Without specific code, this cannot be precisely identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network transmissions, file writes, or execution of system commands. These are typical points where untrusted data could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flow would typically start from sources (inputs) and pass through the code to sinks (outputs or critical operations). Without code, specifics cannot be detailed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without the code. Look for hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, unusual network calls, or unexpected behaviors.",
  "analysis": "No actual code provided for review. Cannot analyze code logic, identify sources, sinks, or flows, or detect anomalies without code content.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to determine malicious behavior or security risks. Please provide the code snippet for a detailed review.",
