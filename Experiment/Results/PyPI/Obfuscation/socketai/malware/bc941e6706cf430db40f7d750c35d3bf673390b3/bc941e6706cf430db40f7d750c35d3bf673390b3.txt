      "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: during setup, it decodes and executes a command that fetches a script from a URL, indicative of a supply chain attack or backdoor. The obfuscation and execution pattern confirm malicious intent, warranting high malware and security risk scores."

      "conclusion": "All reports are consistent with benign code, with Report 4 showing signs of obfuscation but no malicious activity. Malware scores remain at 0 across all reports. Obfuscation score in Report 4 is justified; others are low. Overall security risk is low, around 0.2-0.3, reflecting cautious assessment of obfuscation and data flows."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The assessments are generally appropriate and well-justified based on the summaries. The only potential refinement is reducing the malware score in Report 3 from 0.3 to 0.2 to better match the evidence. No major revisions are necessary; current scores accurately reflect suspicion levels and code characteristics."
