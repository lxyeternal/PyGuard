{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit purpose indicated.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions, file writes, network communication, or system commands, if any are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters, environment variables) to processing functions and then to sinks (outputs, network).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, or obfuscated code observed. No unusual code constructs or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with clear structure, no use of dynamic code execution, no obfuscated parts, and no signs of malicious logic. Usage of third-party libraries is standard and justified. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are detected. Overall, the code looks benign based on its visible content.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the analysis. It appears to be a normal, well-structured Python module without suspicious or malicious code.",
