  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, environment variables, external URLs/files, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file I/O, environment variables, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input or environment variables flow into data processing, network functions, or dynamic code execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Significant obfuscation in Report 4; use of eval/exec in Report 5; absence of code in Report 1; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns in others.",
  "analysis": "Reports 1-3 show benign, straightforward code with high confidence (0.9), no obfuscation, malware, and low security risk (0.2). Report 4 indicates signs of obfuscation (0.7), raising concern but no confirmed malicious activity; moderate confidence (0.6), security risk (0.3). Report 5 mentions dynamic execution potential but no evidence of malicious activity; high confidence (0.8), malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. The high obfuscation in Report 4 justifies its score; the other reports are consistent with benign code. The risk scores are appropriate given the descriptions, with a slight consideration to increase Report 5's risk if eval/exec are used insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent with benign code, with Report 4 showing signs of obfuscation but no malicious activity. Malware scores remain at 0 across all reports. Obfuscation score in Report 4 is justified; others are low. Overall security risk is low, around 0.2-0.3, reflecting cautious assessment of obfuscation and data flows.",
