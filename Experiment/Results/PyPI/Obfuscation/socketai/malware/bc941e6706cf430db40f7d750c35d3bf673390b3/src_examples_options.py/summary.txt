  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent with benign code, with Report 4 showing signs of obfuscation but no malicious activity. Malware scores remain at 0 across all reports. Obfuscation score in Report 4 is justified; others are low. Overall security risk is low, around 0.2-0.3, reflecting cautious assessment of obfuscation and data flows."
