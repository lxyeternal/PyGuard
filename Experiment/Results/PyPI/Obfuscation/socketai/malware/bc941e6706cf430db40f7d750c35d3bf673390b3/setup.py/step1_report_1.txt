{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script with custom install and develop commands that execute a hidden function upon installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The function b64d decodes a base64-encoded string, which is then executed by os.system in notmalfunc().",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes decoded base64 content, which initiates a network request (curl to a remote host).",
  "flows": "During installation or development, the code runs notmalfunc(), decoding the base64 string and executing a system command that fetches data from a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The use of base64 decoding combined with os.system to run an external command during package installation is suspicious. The base64 string decodes to a URL, suggesting hidden network activity. No user input is involved; the behavior is hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and overrides the install and develop commands to run custom code after the standard process. The function b64d decodes a base64 string, which, when decoded, is a curl command to fetch data from 'http://localhost/rev.sh'. This command is executed via os.system within notmalfunc(). This behavior triggers during both install and develop phases, indicating potential malicious intent to execute remote code or fetch malicious scripts without user awareness. The use of base64 encoding to conceal the URL and command is a common obfuscation tactic. The rest of the setup code appears standard, but the core malicious behavior stems from the automatic execution of a remote command during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior, executing a network request to a remote server during installation or development. The use of obfuscated base64 decoding and system call indicates malicious intent designed to run hidden remote scripts. The overall risk is high, and the package should be avoided.",
