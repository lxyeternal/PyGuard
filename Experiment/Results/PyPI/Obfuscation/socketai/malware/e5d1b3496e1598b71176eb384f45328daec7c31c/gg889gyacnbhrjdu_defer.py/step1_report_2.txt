{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators for managing deferred execution of functions, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous functions. It appears to facilitate executing registered functions after the main function completes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments, decorator application, and function inspection (via the inspect module). It does not read external data sources or inputs directly.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network operations, file writes, or data leaks are present. Deferred functions are stored and executed locally without external data transmission.",
  "flows": "The source data (function arguments and decorators) flow into the main functions and the deferred execution queues, which are processed at the end of execution, executing registered functions. No external data flows or output channels are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated variable names and function names, which could be an attempt to hide intent. However, the logic itself is straightforward and does not perform any suspicious operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two decorators: one for non-async functions ('TISnzgCtfsEeAvxLzKLAuvTkudlfKTMr') and one for async functions ('kRQxKvgflcnezMOPljaVYGviSOPsOLPc'). Both decorators enqueue functions to a deque and execute them after the main function completes, with proper handling for sync and async functions. There is no evidence of external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The obfuscated naming might be suspicious, but the core logic is benign and consistent with deferred execution patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a deferred execution mechanism with obfuscated identifiers but contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation might be intended to conceal purpose, but no malicious activity is apparent.",
