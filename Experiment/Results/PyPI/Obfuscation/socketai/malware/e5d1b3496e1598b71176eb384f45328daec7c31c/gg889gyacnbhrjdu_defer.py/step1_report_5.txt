{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators to defer execution of functions, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous functions, by queuing functions and executing them later.",
  "sources": "The code reads function objects and function annotations, particularly during decoration and inside the wrapper functions. It does not read untrusted input data.",
  "sinks": "The code executes functions stored in a queue, including potentially user-provided functions, but it does not evaluate or execute untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Functions are added to a deque in the decorator wrappers, then executed after the main function completes, either synchronously or asynchronously.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated function names and variable names, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or suspicious data leaks are present. No dynamic code execution or evaluation functions are used. The functions defer execution but do not perform harmful actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two decorators, one for sync functions (@TISnzgCtfsEeAvxLzKLAuvTkudlfKTMr) and one for async functions (@kRQxKvgflcnezMOPljaVYGviSOPsOLPc). Both decorators maintain a queue of functions to be executed after the main function completes. They ensure that deferred functions are not async, preventing improper coroutine usage. There is no evidence of data leakage, malicious code, or external communication. The obfuscated naming may be to hide intent or simply a stylistic choice, but it does not indicate malicious activity. The pattern resembles deferred execution or cleanup, which is common in programming but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a deferred execution pattern with support for both sync and async functions. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious side effects, or security risks in this code. The obfuscation appears superficial, and no malicious behavior is detected.",
