{
  "purpose": "Provides decorators for deferred execution of both synchronous and asynchronous functions, enabling functions to be queued and executed after the main function completes.",
  "sources": "The decorated functions passed as arguments to the decorators, stored in a deque during execution.",
  "sinks": "Execution of deferred functions after the main function; no external data, network, or file I/O involved.",
  "flows": "The main function executes, during which deferred functions are enqueued; upon completion, deferred functions are executed or awaited in LIFO order.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of function and variable names; no malicious code, eval, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two decorators for deferred execution, supporting both sync and async functions, with proper checks and execution order. No external data access or malicious payloads are present. Obfuscation is notable but does not indicate malicious intent. The logic is straightforward and aligns with common cleanup or task scheduling patterns. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for deferred execution with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malware or security risks is present. Obfuscation may hinder review but does not imply malicious activity.",
