The high obfuscation level is notable but not necessarily malicious. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score can be considered high (~0.75), reflecting the naming pattern. Overall, the code appears safe but warrants cautious review if part of a larger supply chain."

Despite obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2). The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), justified by the placeholder class name and obscure variable names. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for performance enhancement."
