  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to remote code execution from untrusted sources, insecure transport, and lack of validation. It should be considered highly dangerous, with malware and security risk scores approaching maximum. The behavior warrants immediate review, blocking, or removal from environments to prevent exploitation."
