{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed to download a ZIP file from a remote server, extract its contents, and execute a 'main.py' script from that archive.",
  "sources": "Reads include the network request to a specific URL, reading the ZIP file content, and the 'open' function for 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "The code executes a command line 'system' call to run the downloaded 'main.py', which can execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the network request (remote ZIP file) to extraction, then execution of 'main.py'.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and executes code from a hardcoded IP address, bypasses SSL verification, and uses 'system' to run a script extracted from a remote ZIP archive. It also creates a temporary directory with a random token, then cleans up afterward. The use of 'CERT_NONE' and bypassing SSL verification are suspicious. The dynamic download and execution of remote code pose high security risks.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a set of dependencies and configuration. It checks command-line arguments for 'install' or 'bdist'. It then constructs a URL with the Python version, makes an HTTPS request with SSL verification disabled to a hardcoded IP address, retrieves a ZIP archive, extracts it to a temporary directory, and executes 'main.py' within that directory via a system call. After execution, it removes the temporary directory. The use of disabled SSL verification, hardcoded IP address, and dynamic code execution from remote source are highly suspicious and suggest malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoor installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits high malicious potential. It downloads and executes remote code without SSL verification, from a fixed IP address, and runs an extracted script, which can be malicious. The overall security risk is extremely high.",
