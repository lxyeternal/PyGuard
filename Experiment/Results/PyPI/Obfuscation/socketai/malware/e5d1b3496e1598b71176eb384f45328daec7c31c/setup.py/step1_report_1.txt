{
  "purpose": "The script appears to download a ZIP file from a remote server, extract its contents, and execute a Python script within it, possibly to run code from an external source.",
  "sources": "The code reads system arguments, the current executable path, and performs network requests via URL open. It also reads a README.md file during setup.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to the temporary directory, runs system commands to execute downloaded code, and deletes temporary files. It also writes logs to a file.",
  "flows": "Input arguments determine whether to proceed. The URL request retrieves a ZIP file, which is extracted and executed via a system call. Data flows from the network request to local file storage and execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes fetching a ZIP from a specific IP address, extracting it, and executing a script within it without validation or integrity checks. The code suppresses SSL verification, potentially to bypass security checks. The use of `system()` to execute downloaded code without verification is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script first verifies command-line arguments to run installation or build commands. It then generates a temporary directory path with a random token, disables SSL verification, and retrieves a ZIP archive from an IP address controlled by an external entity. The archive is extracted to the temp directory, and a script ('main.py') within it is executed via a system call. After execution, the temporary directory is cleaned up. The code logs exceptions to a file. The absence of integrity checks, hardcoded IP address, and execution of remote code without validation strongly suggest malicious intent or supply chain risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code downloads and executes remote code from a hardcoded IP address without verification, which is a significant security risk. It could be used to deliver malware or malicious updates. The overall behavior indicates high malicious potential.",
