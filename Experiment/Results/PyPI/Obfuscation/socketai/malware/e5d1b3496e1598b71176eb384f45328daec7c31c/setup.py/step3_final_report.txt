{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a ZIP archive from a remote server, extracts it into a temporary directory, and executes a 'main.py' script from it without validation, potentially enabling remote code execution.",
  "sources": "Reading the URL request, downloading ZIP data, reading 'README.md' during setup, and constructing the URL based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main.py' via system() after extraction, which runs untrusted remote code; writing exceptions to a temp log file.",
  "flows": "Download ZIP from hardcoded IP -> extract all files -> execute 'main.py' with system() -> cleanup temporary directory.",
  "anomalies": "Disabling SSL verification (`CERT_NONE`), no checksum or signature validation of downloaded content, use of obscure variable names, and dynamic URL construction based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The script performs remote code retrieval and execution without validation, using insecure SSL settings and hardcoded IP, indicating malicious intent or severe security risk. It bypasses integrity checks, making it vulnerable to MITM attacks and malicious payloads. The code's behavior aligns with supply chain attacks or backdoors. Variable naming is not heavily obfuscated, and exception logging could leak sensitive info but is not malicious per se. The high likelihood of malicious activity justifies high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to remote code execution from untrusted sources, insecure transport, and lack of validation. It should be considered highly dangerous, with malware and security risk scores approaching maximum. The behavior warrants immediate review, blocking, or removal from environments to prevent exploitation.",
