  "purpose": "Package initialization script importing modules and retrieving version info from package data.",
  "sources": "Reads version data via pkgutil.get_data from 'aiotools' package.",
  "sinks": "Stores version info in a variable; no external data sinks or outputs.",
  "flows": "Version data flows from pkgutil.get_data into a decoded string variable.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable names; no malicious code or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py pattern: importing modules, setting __all__, and retrieving version info. Obfuscated variable names are unusual but not malicious. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or code injection. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, typical for package setup, with obfuscation that does not imply malicious activity. No evidence of malware or security risks is present.",
