  "purpose": "Implementation of asynchronous caching decorators with optional expiration and size limits for functions, primarily for performance optimization.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, system time source via VhlPbubYhKGBnkjctMHNoVYMaNFNeMVo().time()",
  "sinks": "Internal cache storage (collections.OrderedDict), cache entries",
  "flows": "Function args and kwargs flow into cache key generation; cache retrieval and update flow within cache dict; expiration time and size limits influence cache eviction",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names and a placeholder class 'VhlPbubYhKGBnkjctMHNoVYMaNFNeMVo', indicating obfuscation; no external network activity or secrets detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines cache decorators supporting expiration and size constraints, wrapping async functions. It uses internal data structures for cache management, with no external data leaks. Variable and class names are intentionally obscure, but no malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation appears stylistic or for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The logic is standard for cache decorators, and no suspicious patterns such as backdoors, network connections, or code injection are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of async cache decorators with expiration and size limits. Despite obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2). The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), justified by the placeholder class name and obscure variable names. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for performance enhancement.",
