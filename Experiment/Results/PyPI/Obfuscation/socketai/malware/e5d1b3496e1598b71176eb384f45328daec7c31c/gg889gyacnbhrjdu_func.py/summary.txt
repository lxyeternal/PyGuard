  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of async cache decorators with expiration and size limits. Despite obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2). The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), justified by the placeholder class name and obscure variable names. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for performance enhancement."
