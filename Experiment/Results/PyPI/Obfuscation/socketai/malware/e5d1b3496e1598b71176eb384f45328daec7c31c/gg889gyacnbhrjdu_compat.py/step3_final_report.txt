  "purpose": "Compatibility boilerplate for asyncio functions across Python versions, performing attribute existence checks and assigning functions accordingly.",
  "sources": "Attribute checks on the asyncio module, using hasattr() to determine presence of specific attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not handle external input or output.",
  "flows": "Conditional attribute existence checks leading to assignment of either existing attributes or fallback functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names with no clear semantic meaning; no malicious code or external data handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward compatibility checks on the asyncio module, assigning attributes or fallback functions based on their presence. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are evident. The obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to conceal or obfuscate intent but do not indicate malicious behavior. The logic is benign, and the code appears to serve as compatibility boilerplate. Scores assigned in the reports (malware score 0, low security risk, obfuscation around 0.6-0.7) are consistent with this assessment. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected, and the obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as compatibility code with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or external interactions are present. The obfuscation warrants cautious review if part of a larger codebase but does not indicate malicious intent based solely on this snippet.",
