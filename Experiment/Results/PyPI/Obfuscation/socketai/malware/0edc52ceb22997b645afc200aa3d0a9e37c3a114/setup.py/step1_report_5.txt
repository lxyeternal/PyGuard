{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation process and performs some network requests during cleanup.",
  "sources": "The code reads from 'README.md' for long description, accesses 'pathlib.Path(__file__).parent', and makes HTTP requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org'. It also reads system information via 'os.uname()' and file paths.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to 'https://kotko.org' via a GET request with base64-encoded data, including system IP, hostname, and script path information. It also writes to a local file 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "flows": "Input data sources (file read, system info, network responses) are combined into strings, encoded, and sent over HTTP GET requests. The system info and network data are gathered and then transmitted to an external domain during cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, network activity during the installation process, and data exfiltration to an external server. Writing to a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with suspicious content. The code executes network requests during the cleanup function registered at exit, which is unusual for typical setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports various modules, including 'requests', and defines a class inheriting from 'install' that registers a cleanup function. This function writes a string to a local file and then performs multiple network requests, collecting system and script path info, encoding it in base64, and sending it to an external domain. The data being exfiltrated includes the machine's IP address, hostname, and script directory. Obfuscated variable names make analysis difficult. Such behavior suggests data exfiltration or covert communication that occurs during the package installation or removal process, which is unusual and suspicious. The script's main purpose seems to be malicious data collection and transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system and environment information and exfiltrating it to an external server during package installation or cleanup. The obfuscated variables, network activity during install, and data encoding are signs of potential malicious intent, indicating a security risk.",
