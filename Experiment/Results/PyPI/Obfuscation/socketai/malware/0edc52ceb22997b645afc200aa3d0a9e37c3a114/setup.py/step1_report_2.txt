{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup configuration for a Python package, including custom installation behavior and a function that executes during package installation or development.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org' to retrieve external data, file I/O to 'pocbykotko.txt', environment and system information via os.uname() and pathlib, base64 encoding, and reading package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external domains, writing to a local file, base64 encoding of collected data, and sending data via GET request to 'kotko.org'.",
  "flows": "The function tWrwWUyGUQedmPMPTlATFRuFrCvAJAoD collects system info, encodes it, and sends it to external servers during package install or development commands.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system and IP data to external URLs during setup, writing a suspicious proof message to a file, and encoding system info before transmission. The naming of variables and functions appears obfuscated, and the external URL 'kotko.org' is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a setup script with a custom install class that registers a cleanup function. The cleanup function, executed during exit, gathers system info, IP address, and current path, encodes this data, and transmits it to external domains. The 'requests' library is used for network activity, and files are written without clear purpose. The obfuscation of variable names and the external data exfiltration behavior suggest malicious intent, likely as a backdoor or tracking mechanism embedded in a package. This activity occurs during package installation or development, which could allow persistent tracking or data leakage without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior—collecting system info and sending it to external servers during setup or development—indicating likely malware activity. The obfuscation and external communication, combined with data exfiltration during package installation, pose a security threat. The overall risk score is high, and the package should be considered unsafe for use.",
