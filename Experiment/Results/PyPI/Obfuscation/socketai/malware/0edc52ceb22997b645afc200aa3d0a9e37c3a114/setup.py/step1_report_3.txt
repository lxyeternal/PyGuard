{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package for distribution, with some additional functions executed during installation that perform network requests and file operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from files ('README.md', 'pocbykotko.txt') and network requests to external domains ('https://api.ipify.org', 'https://kotko.org'). It also accesses environment information via 'os.uname()'.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to a local file ('pocbykotko.txt') and makes HTTP GET requests, including sending encoded data ('wVfkORaKULFDeZUwDTfFIwkxsanNgKpO') to external domains, potentially leaking data. It also potentially executes code during package installation via network requests.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves reading system and external IP information, encoding and sending this data to an external URL ('https://kotko.org') during the 'atexit' registered function, which runs during installation. Data from the file and system is collected, encoded, and transmitted to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes network requests to external IP and domain, writing to a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' during installation, encoding and sending system info without clear purpose, and registering a function to run at exit that performs these operations. The variable names are obfuscated, and the purpose of sending data is unclear.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script that, during the installation process, registers a function to execute at exit. This function creates a text file and writes a string to it, then collects system information (public IP, hostname, path), encodes this information in base64, and sends it via a GET request to an external domain ('https://kotko.org') with the data attached as a query parameter. The obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to hide the malicious intent. While the core setup appears legitimate, the network activity and writing of files during installation are suspicious, indicating potential data exfiltration or backdoor behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains potentially malicious behavior, notably executing network requests and writing files during installation, possibly exfiltrating system information. The obfuscation and data transmission are signs of malicious intent. Caution is advised when using this package.",
