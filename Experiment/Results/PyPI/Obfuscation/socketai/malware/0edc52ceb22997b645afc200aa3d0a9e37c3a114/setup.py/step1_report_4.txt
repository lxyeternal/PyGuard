{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package, with an additional function registered to execute upon package installation or script termination.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the request to 'https://api.ipify.org', the current file's path, and potentially external network requests made in the registered cleanup function.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org', file write operations ('pocbykotko.txt'), and base64-encoded data sent over the network; these could be used to exfiltrate information.",
  "flows": "On package install/termination, the code retrieves the public IP address, gathers system info (hostname, path), encodes this info, and sends it to external servers; the file 'pocbykotko.txt' is also written locally.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual registration of a cleanup function that performs network activity and writes files; obfuscated variable names; code appears designed to collect and exfiltrate system and network info covertly.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily functions as a setup configuration, but the presence of a registered cleanup function that makes network requests, captures system info, writes a file, and encodes data suggests malicious intent. The function 'tWrwWUyGUQedmPMPTlATFRuFrCvAJAoD' collects IP address, hostname, and script path, encodes this info, and sends it to a suspicious domain 'kotko.org'. The use of obfuscated variable names and the indirect method of data transmission are suspicious. The code does not perform any legitimate setup activities that justify these actions. No typical malicious activities like payload execution, privilege escalation, or backdoors are present, but the data exfiltration behaviors and obfuscation raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a function that, upon package installation or script termination, collects system and network data and transmits it to a remote server, which indicates malicious behavior. The setup code itself appears normal, but the embedded data exfiltration logic is suspicious. The overall security risk is moderate due to covert data collection activities.",
