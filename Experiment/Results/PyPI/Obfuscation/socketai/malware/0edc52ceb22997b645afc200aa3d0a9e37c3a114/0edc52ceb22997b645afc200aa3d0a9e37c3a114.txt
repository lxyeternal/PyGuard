      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior involving covert data exfiltration, obfuscation, and external communication during package setup or cleanup. The high obfuscation and suspicious external URL strongly suggest malicious intent, classifying this as malware with high security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.85, security risk ~0.85, obfuscated ~0.8) are justified and consistent with the observed behaviors."
