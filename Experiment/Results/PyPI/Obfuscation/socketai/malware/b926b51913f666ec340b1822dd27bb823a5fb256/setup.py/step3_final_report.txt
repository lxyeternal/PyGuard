  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, defining package name, version, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The package name, version variable, and dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated package name 'mxxhmrlrvmk35wq6' and version variable 'mqIFYVAnMFLprAgObbAPHHWRrvErPetP' are unusual and suggest obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated identifiers, which could be used to conceal malicious intent but in isolation shows no malicious behavior. No dynamic code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The dependencies are common packages that are not inherently malicious. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious activity. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is moderate (around 0.6), and the security risk is low (around 0.2). The confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.8).",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with obfuscation possibly used for concealment but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",

  "obfuscated": 0.6,
