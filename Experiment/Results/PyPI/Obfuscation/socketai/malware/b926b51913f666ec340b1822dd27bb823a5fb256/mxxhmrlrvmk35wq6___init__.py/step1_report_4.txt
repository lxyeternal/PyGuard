{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated script performing complex calculations, dynamic imports, and indirect execution, likely designed to hide its true intent and functionality.",
  "sources": "User inputs: '__code__', function parameters, global variables, and possibly external modules or resources loaded via dynamic import and eval.",
  "sinks": "eval() calls, dynamic import (__import__), exec(), and possibly network communication or file operations hidden within obfuscated code.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., '__code__', parameters) flow into eval and exec functions via indirect references, dynamically imported modules and functions are called with manipulated data, with obfuscated strings used to hide malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code using string encodings, dynamic import, eval, exec, indirect function calls, and complex control flow. Presence of hardcoded URLs, seemingly meaningless variable names, and code that manipulates data through obscure expressions. Use of eval with string representations of code indicates potential execution of malicious payload.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with standard imports but then employs obfuscation techniques such as string encoding, indirect function calls via lambdas, and dynamic execution. The class constructor and methods perform arithmetic operations on class attributes, likely to obscure their real purpose. The use of eval, exec, and dynamic module import suggests code is designed to execute hidden payloads. The main block wraps execution in try-except, with fallback logic that re-executes code on exception, indicating resilience against debugging or analysis. The presence of URLs and the use of eval on encoded strings point toward potential malicious intent such as data exfiltration or remote command execution. Overall, the script is crafted to hide its real behavior, making it suspicious for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with techniques like dynamic import, eval, and string encoding, aimed at concealing its true purpose. It involves complex control flows and indirect function calls, typical of malicious scripts seeking to evade detection. The presence of external URLs and payload-like data within encoded strings further supports suspicion of malicious intent. Overall, it is highly likely to contain malicious behavior, with a malware score near the upper range.",
