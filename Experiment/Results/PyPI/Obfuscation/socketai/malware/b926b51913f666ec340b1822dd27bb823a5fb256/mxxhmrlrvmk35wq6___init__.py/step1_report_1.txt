  "purpose": "Obfuscated code with nested functions and dynamic imports, potentially aiming to hide malicious activities or control flow manipulation.",
  "sources": "Reading global variables, constants, imported modules, and string decoding operations; input data may originate from code obfuscation and string manipulation.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic imports, eval, exec, and function calls that can execute arbitrary code or data; the code also attempts to write or modify global states and execute obfuscated modules.",
  "flows": "String decoding and obfuscation functions → dynamic import or execution → control flow manipulation via eval/exec and global modifications; exception handling redirects control flow to re-execute code segments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated strings and lambdas for import and eval; nested generator expressions with try-except blocks that perform dynamic code execution; potential backdoors or malicious payloads hidden behind string encoding.",
  "analysis": "The code heavily relies on obfuscated string decoding, dynamic imports, and eval/exec to run code from encoded strings. It defines a class with methods performing mathematical operations, including the use of imported functions with obfuscated names. The main block executes functions that decode strings, dynamically import modules, and execute code, all within try-except blocks that redirect flow based on exception handling. The pattern suggests an intent to hide malicious logic behind obfuscation. The presence of hardcoded strings, complex control flow, and dynamic code execution points to potential malicious intent, such as code injection, backdoors, or remote code execution capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated and employs dynamic import, string decoding, and eval/exec techniques that are typical in malicious scripts aiming to conceal their true intent. The structure and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious behavior, possibly for code injection or executing hidden payloads, though explicit malicious payloads are not directly visible. The overall risk is high, and the code should be treated as potentially malicious.",
