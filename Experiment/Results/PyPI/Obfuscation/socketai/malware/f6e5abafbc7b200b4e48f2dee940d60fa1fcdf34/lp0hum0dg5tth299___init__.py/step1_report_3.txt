{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web server that serves static files and handles some request routing, potentially for a web application.",
  "sources": "Input data from HTTP requests, environment variables, and configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Response outputs to HTTP clients, potential system commands if executed from user input, logging mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Data from HTTP request parameters or headers may flow into response rendering or logging mechanisms; environment variables could influence behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected; no obfuscated code features; no suspicious network calls or backdoors observed. The code is straightforward and uses common patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an HTTP server, defines route handlers, and serves static files. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or network communication to untrusted domains. It utilizes standard Python libraries and conventions. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present based on the visible code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard web server setup with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears safe and consistent with normal application code.",
