  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network communication, server setup, code snippets, or lack thereof.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, subprocess calls, data leaks, or code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources to potential data exfiltration points or malicious actions, if any.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious network domains, incomplete code, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports describe benign code snippets or lack code altogether, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 or 0, confidence between 0.3 and 0.9) are consistent with the descriptions. The absence of code in some reports justifies low confidence and zero malware scores. The low risk scores reflect minimal concern given the benign descriptions. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are indicated. The evaluations are cautious and appropriate, considering the limited information.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent with benign, non-obfuscated code, with no evidence of malicious intent. The scoring aligns with the provided summaries. No adjustments are necessary; the overall assessment remains that the dependency poses minimal security risk.",
