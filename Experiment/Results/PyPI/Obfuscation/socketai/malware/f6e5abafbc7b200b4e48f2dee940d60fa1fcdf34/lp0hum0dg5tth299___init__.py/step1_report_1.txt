  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the installation or setup of a Python package, possibly including some runtime behavior such as network requests or environment variable handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, and possibly external files or network data if present in the full code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls that could be exploited if untrusted data is processed unsafely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network calls, subprocesses, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Unusual or suspicious behaviors such as dynamic code execution are not evident from the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard Python setup or initialization script. It utilizes common modules and functions without signs of malicious patterns. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoor logic is visible. The absence of hardcoded secrets or obfuscated constructs suggests benign intent. Since the code provided is minimal or incomplete, the analysis is limited to what is observable.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to perform typical setup functions with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
