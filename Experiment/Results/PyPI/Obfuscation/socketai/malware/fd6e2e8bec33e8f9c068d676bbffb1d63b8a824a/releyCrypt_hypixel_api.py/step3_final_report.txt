{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform credential theft, data exfiltration, system reconnaissance, and malicious data collection from browsers, wallets, and applications, then exfiltrate this data via webhooks and uploads, while employing obfuscation and process manipulation techniques.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), browser storage files (cookies, login data, local state), wallet directories, application files, network API responses, local files, and system directories.",
  "sinks": "Discord webhooks, file upload services (Gofile), network requests to geolocation and Discord APIs, file system operations (reading, copying, zipping, deleting), process termination commands (taskkill), and data encryption/decryption routines.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local system files and environment variables → decrypted or parsed → transmitted via network sinks (webhooks, uploads) → files are archived and sent, while processes are killed to disable defenses.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with inconsistent variable names, malformed code snippets, incomplete functions, undefined variables, and dynamic module installation suggest deliberate obfuscation or incomplete code extraction.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors characteristic of credential and data stealers: decrypting stored passwords and cookies, harvesting tokens, collecting files, and exfiltrating data via webhooks and uploads. The heavy obfuscation, inconsistent references, and malformed snippets indicate intentional evasion tactics. Despite syntax errors and incomplete functions, the core activities are evident and align with malware patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, exhibiting comprehensive data theft, exfiltration, process disruption, and obfuscation tactics typical of stealer malware. The activities are consistent with high-severity threat behavior.",
