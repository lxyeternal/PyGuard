{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious data theft tool designed to extract sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, billing info, and files from various applications and browsers, then exfiltrate this data via webhooks or uploads.",
  "sources": "Reads data from system environment variables, local files (browser data, login data, cookies, local state), network responses, and application directories.",
  "sinks": "Sends stolen data to Discord webhooks, uploads files to file-sharing services, and posts data to external URLs. Executes external processes and kills processes related to browsers and applications.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system sources (files, environment variables), decrypted if necessary, then formatted and sent via HTTP requests or file uploads to external servers. The code also kills processes and compresses collected data into ZIP files for exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic module installations, extensive use of threading for concurrent execution, multiple functions for data extraction across different applications, and the inclusion of hardcoded webhook URLs. Contains code to collect browser data, application credentials, cookies, and files, and exfiltrate without user consent. Uses techniques to evade detection, such as process termination and ZIP archiving.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive credential and data stealer targeting browsers, applications, and system files. It dynamically installs dependencies, gathers data from local browser profiles and application directories, decrypts encrypted credentials, and uploads or posts this information to external endpoints. It employs threading to parallelize data collection. The code manipulates cookies, tokens, and personal data, then exfiltrates it via Discord webhooks or file sharing services. Its obfuscated style and inclusion of multiple suspicious activities, such as process termination and data compression, strongly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious. It systematically collects sensitive user data from various sources, decrypts it, and exfiltrates it to external servers. It employs techniques to evade detection and disrupt system processes. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the code should not be used or trusted.",
