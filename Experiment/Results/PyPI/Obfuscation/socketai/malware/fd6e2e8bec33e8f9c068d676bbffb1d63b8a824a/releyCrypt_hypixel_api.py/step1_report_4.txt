{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious script designed to extract sensitive information such as tokens, cookies, passwords, and files from the user's system and send this data to a remote webhook. It also seems to collect browser data, stored credentials, and other personal data for unauthorized access and exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Sources include environment variables, local system files (like Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, Steam, Riot, Telegram, wallets), and user data directories. Data is read from local storage, browser databases, cookies, local state files, and potentially user-input related files.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to a remote Discord webhook URL via HTTP requests, including tokens, cookies, passwords, browser info, and files. It also writes data into local files (e.g., logs, extracted credentials). Functions also attempt to upload files to third-party services like gofile.io.",
  "flows": "Sources (system files, environment variables, user directories) are read into variables, processed (decryption, parsing), and then exfiltrated through HTTP POST requests or uploaded to external servers. Specific functions decrypt encrypted data using Windows cryptography APIs, and the data flows from system/database reads to remote webhooks.",
  "anomalies": "Obvious malicious behavior includes: hardcoded webhook URL, functions that collect cookies, passwords, tokens, browser data, and send or upload this data automatically. The code kills processes, copies and zips browser data, extracts credentials, and performs network activity without user consent. The code uses threading extensively for parallel data collection. There are numerous obfuscated or suspicious function names, inconsistent code style, and references to various system paths. Some code snippets are incomplete or malformed, indicating potential obfuscation or partial code snippets.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by defining a webhook URL for data exfiltration and various global variables. It includes functions to retrieve external IP, check for Google domains, decrypt stored data, collect browser credentials, cookies, and local files, and then compress and upload this data. The code uses threading to perform multiple data collection tasks concurrently, such as browser data, wallet info, and credentials. It interacts with Windows APIs for decrypting stored encrypted keys and passwords. The code also contains several incomplete or corrupted snippets, possibly indicating obfuscation. The overall pattern is consistent with malware designed to harvest sensitive data, exfiltrate it, and avoid detection. It also manipulates process lists and system files, further indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to extract and exfiltrate sensitive user data from browsers, wallets, and system files, then upload or send this data to a remote server via a webhook. The extensive use of obfuscation, threading, and system manipulation confirms malicious behavior aimed at stealing credentials and personal information without user consent.",
