{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a malicious script designed to steal various types of user data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, and files from different applications and browsers, then exfiltrate this data via Discord webhooks and upload services. It also performs some reconnaissance by collecting system info and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (e.g., 'LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA', 'TEMP'), accessing local files and directories related to browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge) and applications (Steam, Discord, Telegram, wallets), reading local database files (e.g., login data, cookies), and fetching external data from APIs (geolocation, Discord API).",
  "sinks": "Sending data to external URLs via HTTP requests (webhooks, upload services), writing collected data into text files, and uploading files to external servers. Also, invoking system commands to kill processes and creating ZIP archives of targeted directories.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from various sources such as browser storage, databases, local state files, environment variables, and application directories. The data flows into in-memory lists, is formatted into JSON or text, then transmitted through HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks or file upload services. Some data, like cookies and passwords, are decrypted and stored temporarily in files before exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of obfuscated or semi-obfuscated variable names, dynamic imports and installation of modules (requests, Crypto), suspicious URL patterns (Discord webhook, geolocation API), process termination commands, creation of ZIP files of directories, and functions that target specific applications and extract sensitive info. The code also features hidden process killing, system info collection, and file reading/writing for credentials and cookies. Additionally, some functions contain inconsistent code snippets, malformed code, and potential copy-paste errors, suggesting possible obfuscation or incomplete code segments.",
  "analysis": "The script is structured to perform a wide range of malicious activities. It imports various modules, some dynamically installing modules like 'requests' and 'pycryptodome'. It collects system info such as IP address and username, decrypts stored passwords and cookies from browsers, and gathers tokens and other sensitive data from applications like Discord, Steam, and wallets. It then exfiltrates this data to Discord webhooks and upload services. It includes process termination commands to kill security or monitoring tools, and archives directories for exfiltration. The code contains obfuscated variable names and complex threading operations, indicating attempts to evade detection. Overall, it functions as a comprehensive data-stealing malware targeting multiple applications and system data, with mechanisms to hide its activities and transmit data covertly.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior characteristic of a data stealer malware. It targets various applications and system data, decrypts stored credentials, and exfiltrates the information via Discord and file upload services. Its obfuscation, process-killing commands, and broad data collection strongly indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the code should not be used or executed in any environment.",
