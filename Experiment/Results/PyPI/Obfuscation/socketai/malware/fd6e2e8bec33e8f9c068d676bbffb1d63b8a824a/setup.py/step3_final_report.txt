  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for a Python package, defining package name, version, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Package name in setup(), dependencies listed in install_requires",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration, no data flow or untrusted input handling",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or nonsensical package name 'h00ganvvx0eh61rh'",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or malicious code. The only anomaly is the suspicious package name, which is highly obfuscated. Dependencies are common and benign. No code execution, network activity, or data handling occurs here. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious behavior on its own. Scores assigned in reports reflect the obfuscation concern but correctly indicate low malware risk due to lack of malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign; no malicious behavior is present. The primary concern is the obfuscated package name, which could be used to conceal malicious intent. Without further context or actual package contents, the malware risk remains very low. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
