  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code snippet:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```python\nfrom .python_mc import *\nfrom .decrypter import *\nfrom .hypixel_api import *\n__all__ = ['python_mc','hypixel_api','decrypter']\n```\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Uses wildcard imports (*) from three local modules.\n- Defines `__all__` to specify exported symbols.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Wildcard imports (`from .module import *`)**: They are generally discouraged because they obscure what is imported, making the code less readable and potentially hiding malicious or unintended code in the imported modules. However, the snippet itself does not contain malicious behavior or vulnerabilities directly.\n\n### Logical errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No explicit errors are present in the code snippet.\n- The use of wildcard imports is a known issue but not a bug per se; it’s more of a style or security concern.\n\n### Review of scores and justifications:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Malware score: 0** — aligns with no direct malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** — no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk: 0.2** — the main concern is the wildcard import hiding content, which is a moderate risk.\n- **Confidence: 0.8** — reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Suggestion:** The malware score is appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2:\n- Similar to Report 1, with identical conclusions and scores.\n\n**Suggestion:** The malware score remains appropriate at 0; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3:\n- Also finds no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence: 1** — high confidence in benign nature.\n- **Malware: 0** — correct.\n- **Security risk: 0** — appropriate.\n\n**Suggestion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4:\n- Same reasoning, no malicious activity.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still reasonable.\n\n**Suggestion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Highlights the use of wildcard imports as a potential risk.\n- **Malware: 0** — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Security risk: 0.2** — consistent with the risk of obscured content.\n- **Confidence: 0.7** — reasonable.\n\n**Suggestion:** The malware score remains appropriate; the security risk is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly elevated (0.2) due to the wildcard import practice, which can hide malicious code in imported modules, but the snippet itself is benign.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The main concern is the use of wildcard imports, which should be avoided or replaced with explicit imports for clarity and security.\n- No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present in this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to wildcard imports, which can hide malicious code in imported modules)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward module re-export with a known style issue (wildcard imports). It does not contain malicious behavior, but the import style could be improved for better security and clarity.",
