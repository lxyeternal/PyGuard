{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module initializer that imports specific submodules and exposes them via the __all__ variable for public API access.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .python_mc, .decrypter, .hypixel_api",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present; the code does not process or handle untrusted input or data",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data transmission is evident within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports is typical in package modules, no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code features are visible",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing three submodules and exposing them via __all__. No data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. Without inspecting the imported modules, no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities can be inferred from this snippet alone. The code structure is standard for Python packages, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple module initializer for a package, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard imports and exposes specific modules for public use. No malicious or suspicious activity is detectable at this level.",
