  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code within the modules",
  "analysis": "The code performs wildcard imports from three local modules and defines __all__ for exports. No network, file, or dynamic code execution is present. Wildcard imports are discouraged as they can hide malicious or unintended symbols, but the snippet itself contains no malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate, reflecting the minimal direct threat but acknowledging the risk associated with import style. Confidence levels are high, given the simplicity and benign nature of the code. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent is found in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that re-exports submodules using wildcard imports. While this practice can obscure imported symbols and pose security risks if the modules are malicious, the code itself shows no malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a low malware likelihood and a modest security risk due to import style. Improving security would involve replacing wildcard imports with explicit imports, but based solely on this snippet, the code is benign.",
