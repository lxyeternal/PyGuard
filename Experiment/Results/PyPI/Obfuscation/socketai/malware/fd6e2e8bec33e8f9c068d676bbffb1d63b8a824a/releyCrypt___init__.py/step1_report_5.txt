  "purpose": "This code is an import statement module that re-exports symbols from local modules: python_mc, decrypter, and hypixel_api.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing all symbols from local modules: python_mc, decrypter, hypixel_api.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable here as the code only imports modules and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) from local modules; no direct evidence of malicious behavior but wildcard imports can obscure imported content and potentially hide malicious code in the imported modules themselves.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from three local modules and sets an __all__ list for module exports. While the syntax itself is standard, the use of wildcard imports (*) can be risky because it obscures which symbols are imported and can hide malicious code within those modules if they exist. However, there is no evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet alone. The presence of multiple local modules suggests a modular design, but without inspecting those modules, we cannot fully assess malicious intent. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or network activities here.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard import operations with the potential risk associated with wildcard imports, which could hide malicious code in the imported modules. However, the provided snippet alone does not contain malicious behavior or security issues. Further review of the imported modules is recommended for comprehensive security assessment.",
