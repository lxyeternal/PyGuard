{
  "purpose": "This code is used to import modules and define publicly accessible APIs for a larger Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules: python_mc, decrypter, hypixel_api",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks",
  "flows": "Importing modules and exposing them via __all__, no data flow from external sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports suggests internal modular structure; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code only imports three modules and defines the __all__ list to specify public API components. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external network activity. The modules imported are potentially part of a larger project, but their contents are not provided for review. No anomalies or indicators of obfuscation or malware are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization snippet used for organizing package exports. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected based on this code fragment.",
