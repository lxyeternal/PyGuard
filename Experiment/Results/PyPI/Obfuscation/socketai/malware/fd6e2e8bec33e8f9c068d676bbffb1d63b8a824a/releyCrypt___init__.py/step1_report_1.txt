{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that re-exports functions or classes from other modules: python_mc, decrypter, and hypixel_api.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing all contents (*) from local modules: python_mc, decrypter, hypixel_api.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network operations, file writes, or eval calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly visible; the code only imports modules and sets __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) can obscure the actual imported functions or classes, potentially hiding malicious code, but the snippet itself does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs module imports and defines an __all__ list for export. Wildcard imports (*) are generally discouraged because they can hide imported content, but in this context, they do not directly indicate malicious activity. No suspicious operations, such as network communication, credential handling, or obfuscated code, are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module re-export with no evident malicious intent. The use of wildcard imports could be risky in larger contexts, but this code alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security issues.",
