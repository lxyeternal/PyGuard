      "conclusion": "The code is benign; no malicious behavior is present. The primary concern is the obfuscated package name, which could be used to conceal malicious intent. Without further context or actual package contents, the malware risk remains very low. The scores are consistent with this assessment."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is a simple downloader with obfuscated identifiers, capable of installing malicious mods if the downloaded file is malicious. While not inherently malicious, its design and context pose a significant security concern. The obfuscation and lack of validation elevate the risk profile. The scores should reflect high obfuscation (around 0.8), moderate to high malware suspicion (around 0.6), and elevated security risk (around 0.6-0.75). Further validation of the URL content is recommended to determine actual maliciousness."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that re-exports submodules using wildcard imports. While this practice can obscure imported symbols and pose security risks if the modules are malicious, the code itself shows no malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a low malware likelihood and a modest security risk due to import style. Improving security would involve replacing wildcard imports with explicit imports, but based solely on this snippet, the code is benign."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits typical malware behaviors: remote payload download, immediate execution, and persistence setup. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9, risk 0.9-1, obfuscation around 0.8) are justified given the malicious pattern. The code should be flagged as highly malicious with high security risk, and the behavior warrants caution and further investigation."
