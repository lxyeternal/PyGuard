  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or security effects in this line.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as this is an import statement with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .core import *' can obscure the actual imported symbols, but this is a common pattern for package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement using relative import syntax. It does not contain any executable logic, data handling, or security-sensitive operations. Importing everything with '*' can be considered poor practice due to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks in this single line.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent. It does not pose a security threat or contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
