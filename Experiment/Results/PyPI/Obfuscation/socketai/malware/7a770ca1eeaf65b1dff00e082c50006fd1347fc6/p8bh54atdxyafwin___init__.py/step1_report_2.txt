{
  "purpose": "The code imports all definitions from a module named 'core', likely for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the 'core' module within the same package or directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'core' module into the current module through import, but no further data flow is visible.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .core import *' can be considered a potential anomaly due to namespace pollution, but it is common in some Python packages. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, which pulls all symbols from a local module named 'core'. This is a standard practice for module imports, though using 'import *' is discouraged for clarity. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks in this single line. No data leaks or dangerous actions are performed here. The code does not show any suspicious patterns, backdoors, or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It does not contain any obfuscation or malware. The security risk is minimal, mainly related to namespace pollution, which is a coding style issue rather than a security concern.",
