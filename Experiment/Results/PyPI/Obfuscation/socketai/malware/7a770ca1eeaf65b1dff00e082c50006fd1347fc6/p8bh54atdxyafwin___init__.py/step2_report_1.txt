  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .core import *`.\n- The code is a simple import statement, with no additional logic.\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which can obscure what symbols are imported and potentially hide malicious code if the 'core' module is compromised.\n- No reports indicate any actual malicious activity, code execution, or data leaks.\n- The 'malware' scores are all zero, aligning with the lack of evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The 'securityRisk' scores are low, mostly between 0.1 and 0.2, which seems appropriate given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  The code is straightforward; no issues are present beyond the general caution with `import *`.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in report logic?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that this is a benign import statement, with some noting the poor practice of `import *`. No logical errors are evident.\n\n- **Scores evaluation:**  \n  The 'malware' scores are all 0, which is justified. The 'securityRisk' scores are low, reflecting minimal risk. The confidence levels vary but are generally high, indicating the reviewers' certainty.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports assign a risk above 0.5, which is appropriate. The highest confidence is 1, but the risk scores remain low, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Malware score reflection?**  \n  All malware scores are 0, aligning with the analysis. No malicious activity is suggested.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that malicious activity cannot be confirmed solely from this import statement.\n\n- **Score consistency?**  \n  The scores are consistent with the descriptions and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The reports are generally accurate. They correctly identify the import as benign but note the potential risks associated with `import *`.\n- No modifications are necessary to the scores based on the information provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the minimal code snippet and the reports' analyses, **the actual risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at zero** because:\n- No malicious activity is evident.\n- The code is a standard import statement.\n- The only concern is the use of `import *`, which is a style issue rather than a security threat.\n\n**However,** to reflect the potential for hidden malicious code in the 'core' module (which is not part of this snippet), a cautious approach might assign a very low 'malware' score if the module is untrusted, but based solely on this snippet, that is unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to acknowledge the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious imports if the module is compromised, but not malicious itself)\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores in the reports are appropriate.\n- The main concern remains the trustworthiness of the 'core' module, which cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.\n\n**This review confirms that the code is not malicious, and the scores are justified.**",
