{
  "purpose": "To import all symbols from the local 'core' module, potentially for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'core' module upon import",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the import loads symbols into namespace, but no data leaks or external effects occur at this point",
  "flows": "Import statement loads symbols from 'core' into current namespace; no runtime data flow or external communication",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if 'core' is compromised; no actual malicious code present in this snippet",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement, with no logic or data processing. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which can lead to namespace pollution and hide malicious symbols if the 'core' module is malicious or compromised. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks is present. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the minimal risk but acknowledging the potential for hidden issues if the 'core' module is untrusted. Confidence is high that this snippet is benign; the primary concern is trust in the 'core' module rather than the import statement itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation, with the main security consideration being the trustworthiness of the 'core' module. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but not malicious. The scores assigned are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2). The overall assessment is that this code snippet poses minimal security risk, assuming the 'core' module is trustworthy.",
