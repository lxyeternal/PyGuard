  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation, with the main security consideration being the trustworthiness of the 'core' module. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but not malicious. The scores assigned are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2). The overall assessment is that this code snippet poses minimal security risk, assuming the 'core' module is trustworthy."
