{
  "purpose": "The code imports everything from a module named 'core' within the same package, likely to use functions, classes, or variables defined there.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement 'from .core import *', which reads data from the 'core' module in the package.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the import statement itself, which could be used to execute code dynamically if the 'core' module is maliciously crafted, but the code as provided does not perform any further actions.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow is present in this snippet beyond the import statement; if the 'core' module contains malicious code, it could execute upon import, creating a flow from the source (import) to potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'import *' can be considered a bad practice as it may hide malicious or unintended behavior by importing unwanted symbols; no other anomalies are present in this minimal code.",
  "analysis": "This code is a single import statement that brings in all contents from a sibling module 'core'. It does not execute any logic beyond the import. The use of 'import *' can obscure what symbols are brought into the namespace, possibly hiding malicious code if 'core' is malicious. Without additional context, there is no evidence of malicious intent. The import alone is standard Python syntax but can be risky if the imported module is malicious or tampered with.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment alone does not exhibit malicious behavior, but the use of 'import *' warrants caution. The security risk depends on the trustworthiness of the 'core' module. There are no indications of malicious activity in this isolated snippet.",
