  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .core import *`.\n- None of the reports identify any actual malicious activity, only potential concerns about coding practices (e.g., namespace pollution, obscured symbols).\n- The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The confidence levels vary but are generally high (0.7–0.8), reflecting confidence that the code is benign.\n- The security risk scores are low, aligning with the absence of evident malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippet is purely an import statement with no execution or data flow beyond module loading.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks.\n- The use of `import *` is discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Logical Issues:\n- The reports correctly identify that the main concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide imported symbols and potentially mask malicious code if the `core` module is compromised.\n- No report suggests that the `core` module is malicious, but this is a key dependency. The risk depends on the trustworthiness of that module, which cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.\n- The assumption that the import alone does not execute code beyond loading symbols is correct; however, if the `core` module contains malicious code in its top-level execution, that would be triggered upon import. None of the reports explicitly mention this possibility, which is an important consideration.\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which seems appropriate unless the `core` module itself is malicious.\n- The security risk scores are low, which aligns with the minimal code shown.\n- The confidence levels are reasonable given the limited context.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since the actual content of the `core` module is unknown, a more accurate risk assessment would consider the trustworthiness of that module.\n- The reports could emphasize that if the `core` module is malicious or tampered with, importing it could execute malicious code, especially if the module contains top-level code or malicious symbols.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code in the snippet itself)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2–0.3 (low, but depends on trust in `core` module)\n\n**Note:** If the `core` module is from an untrusted source, the risk could be higher, but based solely on this import statement, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is benign but relies on the trustworthiness of the `core` module.\n- The use of `import *` is a style concern but not a security issue per se.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable given the information.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain malware score at 0 unless further analysis of the `core` module reveals malicious content. The obfuscated score remains 0. The overall risk score should stay low unless additional context indicates otherwise.",
