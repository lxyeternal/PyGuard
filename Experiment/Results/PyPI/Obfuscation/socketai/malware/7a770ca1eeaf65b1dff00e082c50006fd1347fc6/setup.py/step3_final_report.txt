{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a setup script for a Python package, including build and upload commands, but contains embedded malicious activity that exfiltrates sensitive system data.",
  "sources": "Reads the file '/etc/passwd', version information via exec or variable assignment, and external files like README.md.",
  "sinks": "Sends encoded data (the contents of '/etc/passwd') via an HTTP POST request to a specified webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Reads '/etc/passwd' -> encodes it with base64 -> URL-encodes the data -> transmits over the network to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Accesses and transmits '/etc/passwd' without authorization, uses obfuscated variable names, dynamically executes code to obtain version info, and performs network exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations but also secretly reads the sensitive '/etc/passwd' file, encodes its contents, and sends it to an external URL, indicating data exfiltration. The obfuscated variable names and dynamic code execution suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The network activity to a webhook URL is suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior. The rest of the code, including build and upload commands, appears standard but is coupled with this malicious activity, elevating the security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious activity involving unauthorized reading and exfiltration of system data, specifically '/etc/passwd'. This activity justifies a high malware and security risk score. The obfuscation level is moderate. Overall, the package should be flagged for security review before use.",
