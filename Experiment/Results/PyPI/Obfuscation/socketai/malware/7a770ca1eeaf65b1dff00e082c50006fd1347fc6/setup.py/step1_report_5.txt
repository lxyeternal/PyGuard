  "purpose": "The code is primarily a setup script for building and uploading a Python package to PyPI, including a custom command for publishing.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the filesystem (README.md, __version__.py, /etc/passwd), environment variables, and network (urllib.request.urlopen). It also processes package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Network request to a webhook URL with encoded system data; system calls for building, uploading, and pushing git tags; file deletion of 'dist' directory.",
  "flows": "System reads /etc/passwd → Encodes and sends data via URL request → Executes system commands for package upload and git tagging.",
  "anomalies": [
    "Accesses and reads /etc/passwd, which could indicate collecting system info.",
    "Encodes system data and sends it to an external webhook URL, potentially exfiltrating sensitive info.",
    "Contains hardcoded URL (webhook.site) for data exfiltration.",
    "Uses os.system() for executing build, upload, and git commands, which can be manipulated.",
    "Includes a variable with base64-encoded data derived from system info.",
    "Executes dynamic code via exec() to load version info, which could be risky if manipulated."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks but includes suspicious behavior: it reads sensitive system data (/etc/passwd), encodes and transmits it to an external server, and uses system calls to upload packages and manage git tags. These actions suggest data exfiltration rather than benign setup operations. Although the primary purpose appears to be package publishing, the embedded network activity and system info collection are anomalous and indicative of malicious or spyware-like behavior. The code does not perform harmful system modifications or malware deployment but covertly leaks system info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is mostly a benign setup script with embedded suspicious activity that exfiltrates system data via a webhook. This behavior is malicious in intent, as it secretly gathers and transmits sensitive information, constituting a security threat. The overall security risk is high, with significant potential for privacy violations.",
