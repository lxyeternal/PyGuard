  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing or utility functions, but no explicit purpose is clear from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters, environment variables, or external modules; specific input sources are not clearly indicated.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, but without explicit code, flow analysis is limited.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited by the lack of visible code content. Based on available context, the code appears benign with no signs of malicious activity. There are no indications of data leakage, suspicious network activity, or malicious logic. The code structure and usage do not show anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The overall risk level seems low, but without detailed code, certainty is limited.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and non-suspicious, but a more thorough review of the actual source code would be needed for a definitive assessment.",
