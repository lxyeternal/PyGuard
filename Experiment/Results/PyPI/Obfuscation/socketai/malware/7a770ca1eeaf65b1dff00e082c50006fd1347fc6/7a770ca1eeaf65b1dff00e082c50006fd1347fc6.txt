      "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious activity involving unauthorized reading and exfiltration of system data, specifically '/etc/passwd'. This activity justifies a high malware and security risk score. The obfuscation level is moderate. Overall, the package should be flagged for security review before use."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation, with the main security consideration being the trustworthiness of the 'core' module. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but not malicious. The scores assigned are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2). The overall assessment is that this code snippet poses minimal security risk, assuming the 'core' module is trustworthy."

      "conclusion": "The dependency contains some code with obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating moderate suspicion but no confirmed malicious payloads. Most samples are benign. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with the highest suspicion in the first report due to obfuscation and dynamic code. No definitive malware is detected, but caution is advised for obfuscated and suspicious code segments."
