{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package but includes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command execution that is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess, which could lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoor installation.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' directory -> if absent, executes obfuscated PowerShell payload silently -> setup() function runs with suppressed errors.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command executed with hidden window flags; broad exception handling; execution triggered conditionally based on directory existence; setup function wrapped in try-except.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for a directory and, if missing, runs a hidden, encoded PowerShell command, likely containing malicious payloads. The command is obfuscated, and execution is silent, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The setup() call appears benign but may serve as a cover. The broad exception handling masks errors, further hiding malicious intent. These behaviors are consistent with malware tactics such as stealthy backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms. Given the indicators, the code demonstrates high suspicion of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered conditionally, which strongly suggests malicious activity. The setup function appears to be a decoy. Overall, the script is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous, warranting further investigation and removal from supply chain sources.",
