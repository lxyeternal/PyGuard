      "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior characteristic of malware, including obfuscated, hidden execution of a PowerShell command during setup, with error suppression. The pattern aligns with tactics used in malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Scores assigned in the reports are justified; I recommend treating this package as malicious or highly suspicious pending further decoding of the PowerShell command."
