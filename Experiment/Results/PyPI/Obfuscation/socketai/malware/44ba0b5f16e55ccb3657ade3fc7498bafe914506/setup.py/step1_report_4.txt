  "flows": "Code checks for the existence of 'tahg' directory -> if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess, potentially retrieving or executing remote code.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess with 'WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flags; the command is Base64 encoded, which is suspicious as it obscures its intent. No visible use of the subprocess output or validation.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a setup import, then checks if the 'tahg' directory exists. If not, it launches a subprocess with a Base64-encoded PowerShell command, executed in a hidden window, without capturing output. The command's purpose is obfuscated by encoding, a common tactic to hide malicious intent. The setup call with package metadata appears benign but is secondary. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors silently, which might hide failures or malicious activity. The encoded command, when decoded, likely executes arbitrary code, potentially downloading or executing remote payloads. Overall, the code exhibits behavior consistent with malware, specifically attempting to run hidden code possibly from an external source.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious Base64-encoded PowerShell command executed in a hidden window, which is indicative of malicious activity. The purpose appears to be to run remote or hidden code without user awareness. The setup configuration is harmless but likely a cover or side effect. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
