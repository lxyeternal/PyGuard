  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The variable NOgxOMQDIepQopYOVIpSABCddeBSyHMS (unused), and the dependencies listed in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only sets package info and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated, unused variable with a nonsensical name; no active malicious code or data flow.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with an obfuscated variable that is unused and does not influence behavior. Dependencies are common packages that could be misused but are not malicious by themselves. No code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscated variable appears to be an artifact or superficial obfuscation, not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, low security risk, low obfuscation) are consistent with this benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with an obfuscated but unused variable. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The dependencies are standard and not inherently malicious. The overall security risk is negligible.",
