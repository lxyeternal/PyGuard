  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the package setup parameters and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data is being sent or used in a way that could leak data or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code simply defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "The variable 'NOgxOMQDIepQopYOVIpSABCddeBSyHMS' appears to be an unused obfuscated string, possibly a placeholder or an attempt to obscure information, but it doesn't affect the setup process.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions from setuptools, defines an obfuscated variable with a version number, and calls setup with a package name and required dependencies. No code execution, data input, or malicious behavior is present. The dependencies include common packages for browser cookies, Discord webhooks, Roblox interactions, and HTTP requests, which by themselves are not malicious but could be used maliciously if misused in an attack. The obfuscated variable is unused and does not influence the setup process.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable that is unused. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code execution. The dependencies are common and not inherently suspicious. Overall, the code appears benign.",
