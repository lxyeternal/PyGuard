{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with minimal dependencies and perform some system commands.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (_eexecutable), creating temporary files (_ffile), and reading from external URL via urlopen.",
  "sinks": "Executing system commands (_ssystem) and executing code fetched from external URL via exec.",
  "flows": "Temporary file contains code that fetches and executes remote content; system call attempts to run a file based on the Python executable.",
  "anomalies": "The code writes a payload to a temporary file that loads and executes remote code from an external URL, which is a significant security concern. The payload is then executed via system call, which could be malicious. The code also attempts to run a file derived from the executable path, but the variable _ttmp is undefined, indicating possible incomplete or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup for packaging, but then creates a temporary file and writes a Python snippet that fetches and executes code from a remote URL. This behavior indicates potential remote code execution (RCE) and remote command injection. It then attempts to run an executable derived from the current Python interpreter, which could be an obfuscation or malicious attempt to execute unintended code. The code lacks input validation, hardcodes external URL, and uses exec on data fetched from the internet, all of which are security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, notably the remote code fetch and execution via exec, and the obfuscated system command execution. The presence of remote code fetch, exec, and attempts to run derived executables indicates high malicious potential. This code should be considered unsafe and potentially malicious.",
