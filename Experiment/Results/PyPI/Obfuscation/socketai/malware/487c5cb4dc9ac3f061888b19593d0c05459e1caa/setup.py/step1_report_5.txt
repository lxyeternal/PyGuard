{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, with embedded code to execute a remote script and possibly start an executable.",
  "sources": "The embedded code in the NamedTemporaryFile that downloads and executes remote content; the use of _system to start an executable.",
  "sinks": "exec() call with remote content, system call executing a possibly manipulated executable file.",
  "flows": "Remote URL content is fetched and executed via exec(), then an executable is launched via _system.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and executes code from an external URL without validation; dynamic execution of remote content; the temporary file is used solely to run remote code.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a temporary file, writes a Python command to fetch and execute code from an external URL, then closes it. The code then attempts to start an executable based on the current Python executable's name, replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe'. The remote code execution via exec() is highly suspicious, indicating potential malicious behavior such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The use of system to run a potentially manipulated executable further increases risk. The overall structure and embedded remote code suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-risk remote code execution vector and attempts to run external code from an untrusted source, constituting malicious behavior. The package should be considered unsafe.",
