{
  "purpose": "The code extracts stored browser credentials, decrypts them, and exfiltrates the data via a hardcoded webhook URL, indicating malicious credential theft.",
  "sources": "Browser data directories, environment variables, 'Local State' files, 'Login Data' SQLite databases.",
  "sinks": "Temporary files, network exfiltration via webhook, decrypted credential data.",
  "flows": "Reads browser data, decrypts stored passwords using cryptography routines, formats credential info, and exfiltrates via webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded webhook URL, cryptographic decryption routines, copying of database files to temp directories, obfuscated variable names, lack of user consent or permissions.",
  "analysis": "The code accesses browser profile directories, decrypts stored passwords with Windows cryptography functions, copies databases to temporary locations, decrypts credentials, and prepares data for exfiltration. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL and cryptographic routines strongly suggest malicious intent. Variable names are obfuscated, but no advanced obfuscation techniques are evident. The flow aligns with credential theft malware. Scores of malware 1.0, security risk 1.0, and obfuscation 0.3 are justified based on behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a malicious credential stealer that decrypts and exfiltrates sensitive browser data via a webhook. All indicators confirm high malicious intent and security risk, warranting maximum malware and risk scores.",
