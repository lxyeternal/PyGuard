  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Extracts browser passwords, cookies, and exfiltrates via webhook.\n- **Sources:** Browser data directories, environment variables.\n- **Sinks:** Writes to temp files, exfiltrates via webhook.\n- **Flow:** Reads data, decrypts with cryptography, sends data.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded webhook, decryption routines, obfuscated variable names.\n- **Conclusion:** Malicious credential theft with high confidence (0.9), malware score (1), security risk (1).\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the malicious intent, the decryption routines, and the exfiltration method. The malware score of 1 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Extracts browser passwords and sensitive info, exfiltrates via webhook.\n- **Sources:** Browser profile directories, environment variables.\n- **Sinks:** Temporary files, network via webhook.\n- **Flow:** Data decryption, formatting, exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, extensive data collection, no user consent.\n- **Conclusion:** Malicious, credential-stealing behavior, high risk (0.9), malware (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code behavior. The malware score of 0.9 is reasonable, given the strong indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Extracts cookies, passwords, sensitive info, exfiltrate via webhook.\n- **Sources:** Browser data, environment variables.\n- **Sinks:** Files, network transmission.\n- **Flow:** Decrypts stored credentials, formats data, exfiltrates.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of cryptography, copying databases, no obfuscation, suspicious URL.\n- **Conclusion:** Credential stealer, high malicious intent, malware score 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly captures the behavior. The malware score of 0.9 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Extracts passwords, login data, exfiltrate via webhook.\n- **Sources:** 'Local State', 'Login Data', environment variables.\n- **Sinks:** Temporary files, network.\n- **Flow:** Decrypts passwords, formats, exfiltrates.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, detailed credential extraction, no user consent.\n- **Conclusion:** Malicious credential theft, high risk, malware 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code. The malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Extracts stored credentials, exfiltrate via webhook.\n- **Sources:** Browser directories, environment variables.\n- **Sinks:** Files, network.\n- **Flow:** Decrypts data, formats, exfiltrates.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, detailed credential extraction, suspicious URL.\n- **Conclusion:** Malicious credential stealer, malware score 1.0, high security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report accurately describes the code's behavior. The malware score of 1.0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malicious activity:** All reports agree the code is designed for credential theft, decrypting stored passwords, cookies, and exfiltrating via a webhook.\n- **Obfuscation:** Most reports note low or no obfuscation, but some mention variable names are suspicious or obfuscated, which aligns with malicious code.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are consistently high (0.9 or 1.0), which is appropriate given the behaviors.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Risk scores:** All are justified as high (above 0.5), reflecting serious security concerns.\n- **Malware scores:** Given the clear credential theft and exfiltration, scores of 0.9 or 1.0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Generally low, but some reports note partial obfuscation; that is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final System-Wide Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 1.0 (since all reports describe clear malicious credential theft)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.3 (some minor obfuscation or suspicious variable names, but not heavily obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 1.0 (highly dangerous, exfiltrates sensitive data without consent)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The code is malicious, decrypts and exfiltrates sensitive browser data, and should be classified with maximum malware and risk scores. The obfuscation level is moderate to low, but the core behavior remains highly malicious.",
