  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, external dependencies, environment variables, network calls, data handling functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file system writes, environment variable access, database queries, system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data from sources to sinks via function calls, data processing, or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual control flow, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate the code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2) are consistent with the descriptions. Reports lacking code appropriately have zero scores. Confidence levels are high where code is present, and low where absent. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected across the reports. The reasoning aligns with the scores, and the low security risk reflects the benign nature of the code. No further issues or suspicious signals are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code snippets and reports suggest no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified. Overall, the supply chain appears secure based on current data, but continued monitoring is recommended.",
