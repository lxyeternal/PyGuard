{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect Telegram session data, archive it, and exfiltrate it to a remote server via a webhook.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the Telegram Desktop tdata directory, specifically eMwdgnTJmdxHyZBweCbaaPbsCeYXQeYY+'\\AppData\\Roaming\\Telegram Desktop\\tdata'. It also opens the created zip file for reading.",
  "sinks": "The code sends the collected data over HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL. It also reads from local files and archives them, which could leak sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the local Telegram tdata directory (source) into a zip archive, which is then sent over the network to the remote webhook URL (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL, lack of error handling for network failures, and the process of copying, zipping, and exfiltrating sensitive Telegram data without user consent suggest malicious intent. The use of broad exception handling suppresses errors, which is typical of obfuscated or malicious scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script checks if the Telegram 'tdata' directory exists in the user's AppData. If it does, it attempts to copy this directory to a temporary location, then creates a zip archive of the copied data. Afterward, it opens the zip file and sends it via a POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The process involves accessing potentially sensitive user data and exfiltrating it without user awareness. The code lacks validation, error handling, or user consent prompts, indicating malicious intent. The direct use of a webhook for data exfiltration is a typical tactic for malware. The code structure and obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to hide its true purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be malicious, designed to exfiltrate Telegram session data to an attacker-controlled server via a Discord webhook. It performs sensitive data collection and transfer without user consent, indicating malicious behavior.",
