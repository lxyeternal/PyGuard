{
  "purpose": "The code collects Telegram session data from the user's AppData directory, compresses it, and exfiltrates it via a hardcoded webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reads the Telegram 'tdata' directory in the user's AppData path.",
  "sinks": "Requests library's POST method sending the ZIP file to the webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Checks for directory -> copies directory to temp -> zips the directory -> opens ZIP -> sends ZIP via POST request.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, broad exception handling suppressing errors, hardcoded webhook URL, no user consent prompts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs malicious data exfiltration of Telegram session files. It obfuscates its intent through variable naming and error suppression. The code's behavior aligns with typical malware designed for privacy invasion. The use of hardcoded URLs and lack of user prompts further indicate malicious intent. The process flow is straightforward but concealed through obfuscation. The code does not perform any validation or encryption, increasing its malicious profile. Overall, the script is a covert data theft tool targeting Telegram sessions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data without consent. It exhibits obfuscation, uses hardcoded URLs, and suppresses errors, all characteristic of malware. The high malware score (1.0) is justified, and the security risk is extremely high. It should be flagged and removed from any environment.",
