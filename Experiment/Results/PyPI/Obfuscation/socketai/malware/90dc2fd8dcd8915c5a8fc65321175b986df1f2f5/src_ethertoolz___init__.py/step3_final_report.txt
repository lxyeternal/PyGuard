  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code segments where data is read, environment variables accessed, network connections initiated, or file operations occur.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, file system, execution points).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, suspicious network domains, unusual dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected. Obfuscation is minimal or absent. No external data leaks or malicious network activity are evident. The code's benign nature is supported by high confidence scores and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code is benign with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and overall risk is minimal. No immediate concerns are identified based on the provided code.",
