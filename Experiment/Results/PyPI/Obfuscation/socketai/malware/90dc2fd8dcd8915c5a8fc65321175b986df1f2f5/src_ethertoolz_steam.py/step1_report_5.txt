  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided; no comments or documentation are present to clarify intent.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, input functions, or external modules; specific source locations are not explicitly evident due to lack of code context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data outputs, but specific sink locations are not clearly visible without actual code lines.",
  "flows": "Flow paths from data sources to sinks cannot be determined without explicit code content; no evident data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected; code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "Without the actual code content, analysis is limited. No suspicious patterns such as code injection, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors are observable. The code appears to be standard Python code with no evident malicious behavior or security issues based solely on the provided description.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of visible code content and suspicious patterns, the code does not demonstrate malicious intent or security risks. However, a detailed review of the actual code lines could provide more certainty.",
