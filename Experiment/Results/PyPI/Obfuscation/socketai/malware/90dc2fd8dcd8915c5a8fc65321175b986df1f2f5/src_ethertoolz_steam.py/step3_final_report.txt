  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, code files, and descriptions provided in reports.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through network connections, hardcoded secrets, or malicious data handling points if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through code logic to sinks like network communication or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently describe code as benign, straightforward, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. Malware scores are zero, obfuscation scores are zero, and security risk scores are low (0.2), justified by the lack of detailed code or suspicious activity. Confidence levels are high (0.8-0.9) where code details are sufficient, and lower (0.4-0.7) when code is minimal or absent. The reasoning aligns with the scores, and no evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no detectable malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, and malware and obfuscation scores of zero are justified. All reports are consistent and accurate given the available information.",
