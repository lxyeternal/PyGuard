  "purpose": "Configure the setup script for packaging a Python project with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, setup() function call, dependencies list in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 't6xyzv15tety29nd' appears obfuscated or random, which could be suspicious. No other anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. The package name seems intentionally obfuscated, which might be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. All dependencies are standard libraries or common packages. No code execution, data collection, or malicious activity is evident. The script appears to be a typical setup configuration with an unusual package name.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script with an obfuscated package name. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on this code fragment.",
