  "purpose": "A standard setup.py script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static parameters within the setup() function, including package name, version, license, package directory, keywords, and install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - no dynamic data flow; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 't6xyzv15tety29nd' appears randomly generated or obfuscated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no dynamic or malicious code. The only suspicious aspect is the obfuscated package name, which could be used to hide malicious intent. Malware scores are consistently zero across reports, aligning with the benign nature of the code. Obfuscation scores vary, reflecting suspicion about the package name, with higher scores (up to 0.8) justified by the randomness of the name. Security risk scores are low, indicating minimal threat. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with an obfuscated package name. There is no malicious activity detected. The main concern is the suspicious package name, which warrants cautious review if the source is untrusted. Malware score remains at 0; obfuscation score should be around 0.7 to reflect the suspicious name; overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
