  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with an obfuscated package name. There is no malicious activity detected. The main concern is the suspicious package name, which warrants cautious review if the source is untrusted. Malware score remains at 0; obfuscation score should be around 0.7 to reflect the suspicious name; overall security risk is low (~0.2)."
