  "conclusion": "The code reviews are consistent and justified; no evidence of malicious activity is found. The obfuscation suspicion in report 4 is reasonable but does not indicate malware. Scores are appropriate; further dynamic analysis could clarify obfuscation concerns. Overall, the dependency appears benign with no immediate security threats."
