  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, security risks, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Code reading environment variables, data processing functions, potential external network interactions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input functions flow into processing or network transmission functions.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation in report 4, dynamic code execution signs, minimal or incomplete code in reports 1 and 3, potential hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "Reports 1, 2, 3, and 5 indicate minimal or benign code with no malicious patterns, appropriate low malware scores, and low security risks. Report 4 shows signs of obfuscation and suspicion but no concrete malicious activity, warranting cautious scoring. The scores are consistent with the evidence; malware scores remain at 0 or 0.2, obfuscation is high only in report 4 (0.7), and security risks are low (~0.2-0.4). The overall assessment aligns with the evidence, emphasizing that no malicious activity is confirmed, and suspicion is limited to obfuscation signs.",
  "conclusion": "The code reviews are consistent and justified; no evidence of malicious activity is found. The obfuscation suspicion in report 4 is reasonable but does not indicate malware. Scores are appropriate; further dynamic analysis could clarify obfuscation concerns. Overall, the dependency appears benign with no immediate security threats.",
