  "conclusion": "The code is largely benign with minimal security risks. The presence of eval()/exec() warrants cautious scoring but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall supply chain security appears sound, with scores reflecting low threat levels. Continuous monitoring is recommended for dynamic constructs."
