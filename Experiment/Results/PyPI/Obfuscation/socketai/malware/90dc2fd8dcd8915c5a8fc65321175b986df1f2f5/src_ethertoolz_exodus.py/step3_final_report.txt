  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, dynamic execution functions (eval()/exec()), input/output functions, network/file I/O.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) to sinks (network/file operations, eval()/exec()).",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() potentially on untrusted data, obfuscation indicators, hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code appears mostly benign across reports, with no concrete malicious activity. Report 4 notes dynamic execution (eval()/exec()), which introduces potential security concerns but lacks evidence of malicious payloads. Scores are generally consistent: malware scores are low (0-0.2), obfuscation scores are mostly zero except in report 4 (0.4), and security risks are low (0.1-0.3). The confidence levels are high where no suspicious patterns are observed. Slightly higher malware or risk scores could be justified if dynamic execution is confirmed to process untrusted data, but current evidence supports the existing scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is largely benign with minimal security risks. The presence of eval()/exec() warrants cautious scoring but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall supply chain security appears sound, with scores reflecting low threat levels. Continuous monitoring is recommended for dynamic constructs.",
