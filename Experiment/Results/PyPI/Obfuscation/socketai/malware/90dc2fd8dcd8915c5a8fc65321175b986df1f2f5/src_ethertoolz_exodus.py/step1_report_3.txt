  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, likely intended for general execution or utility purposes. Without specific comments or context, its purpose cannot be definitively identified.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly from imported modules. No clear input sources such as files, network, or user prompts are explicitly evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if present. No explicit dangerous sinks such as command execution or data exfiltration points are observed.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flows. The code structure does not reveal untrusted data propagation or manipulative data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are detected. The code appears straightforward and well-structured. No hidden backdoors or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple, with standard imports and function definitions. It does not utilize risky modules or patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident. It appears to be a benign utility or application code without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. The code appears safe, with no anomalies or malicious patterns identified.",
