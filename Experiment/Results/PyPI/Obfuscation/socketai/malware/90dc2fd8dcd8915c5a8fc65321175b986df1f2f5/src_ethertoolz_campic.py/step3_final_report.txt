  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, eval/exec usage, hardcoded URLs, environment variables, input handling, network connections.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system modifications, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or user input to eval/exec or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, hardcoded URLs, obfuscated code, dynamic execution, suspicious imports, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code (or description) indicates that in the absence of actual code, the reports are cautious, assigning low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 2 describes patterns like eval/exec and hardcoded URLs, justifying moderate suspicion (malware 0.3, obfuscated 0.7, risk 0.5). Other reports lack code, so scores are zero or very low, aligning with their descriptions. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and no further adjustments are necessary unless actual malicious payloads are confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no confirmed malicious activity; patterns like eval/exec and obfuscation in Report 2 justify moderate suspicion. Overall, the scores are appropriate and consistent with the provided descriptions. No revisions are needed.",
