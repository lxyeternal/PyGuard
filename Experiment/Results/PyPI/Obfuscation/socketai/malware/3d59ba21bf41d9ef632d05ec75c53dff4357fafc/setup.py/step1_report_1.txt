  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom install command likely designed to execute malicious code during installation.",
  "sources": "The custom install class, specifically the method UJDddaNJYeklFuDwXpcvWvZUncZzhOwn, which constructs and executes a base64-decoded shell command.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a base64-decoded shell command that initiates a reverse shell connection to an external host.",
  "flows": "The method constructs a base64-encoded payload, decodes it, and executes it via os.system, which connects to an external server and spawns a bash shell, providing remote access.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names, base64 encoding of malicious shell command, dynamic construction of reverse shell connection, execution during installation process.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command inheriting from setuptools' install class. During installation, it constructs a reverse shell payload targeting host 'e6j4342057.zicp.fun' on port 26264. The payload is embedded as a base64-encoded string, decoded, and executed with os.system, resulting in a remote shell connection. The obfuscation of class and method names, along with the base64 encoding and dynamic execution, strongly suggests malicious intent aimed at remote code execution and system compromise during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior designed to establish a reverse shell connection during package installation, representing a severe security threat. The obfuscation and encoded payload further confirm malicious intent.",
