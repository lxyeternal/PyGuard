{
  "purpose": "The code appears to modify the installation process of a Python package to include a malicious payload that initiates a reverse shell connection to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads external network addresses and ports from hardcoded variables and constructs a shell command that is then base64-decoded and executed.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes the decoded shell command, which establishes a reverse shell connection, representing a critical sink.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a base64-encoded reverse shell command, decodes it, and executes it via os.system, connecting to an external server controlled by an attacker.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated, concatenated network commands within a setup script; use of base64 encoding to conceal malicious activity; injection of reverse shell payload into install process.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that overrides the default install behavior. During installation, it constructs a reverse shell command that connects to a hardcoded domain and port. The command is base64-encoded to obscure its intent, then decoded and executed with os.system. The reverse shell payload allows remote access to the compromised system, which is typical malicious behavior. The obfuscation techniques and injection into setup routines are suspicious. No benign functionality or legitimate purpose is evident for these malicious steps. The code operates only during installation, making it a stealthy backdoor.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code designed to establish a reverse shell backdoor upon installation. It uses obfuscation to hide its intent and executes malicious network commands through standard setup routines. It poses a high security risk and should not be used.",
