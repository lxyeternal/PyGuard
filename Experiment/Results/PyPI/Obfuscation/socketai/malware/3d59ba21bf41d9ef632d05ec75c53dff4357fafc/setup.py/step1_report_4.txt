{
  "purpose": "This setup script installs a Python package but includes malicious code that establishes a reverse shell connection to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads external server address and port, and executes obfuscated commands via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The base64-decoded command executed with os.system spawns a reverse shell, providing remote control to an attacker.",
  "flows": "The code encodes a malicious command in base64, decodes it, and executes it with os.system, creating a network connection to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, use of base64 encoding for malicious commands, dynamic execution of code via os.system, hardcoded external server and port, and an embedded reverse shell payload.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the install class to run additional malicious code during package installation. It constructs a reverse shell command targeting 'e6j4342057.zicp.fun' on port 26264, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system. This allows remote attackers to gain shell access. The use of obfuscated names and encoding indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent. No legitimate package functionality is present beyond the setup, confirming malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious intent, establishing a reverse shell connection during package installation. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious. Do not install or distribute this package.",
