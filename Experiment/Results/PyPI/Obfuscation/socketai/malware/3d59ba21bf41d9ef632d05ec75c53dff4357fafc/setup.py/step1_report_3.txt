{
  "purpose": "This setup script appears to install a Python package, but it contains code that attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded variables such as the domain name and port number, and executes system commands.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.system to execute a base64-decoded shell command, which creates a reverse shell connection to a remote host.",
  "flows": "The code encodes a reverse shell command in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system, connecting to the hardcoded domain and port.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class and variable names that seem obfuscated, the code generates and executes a base64-encoded shell command, which is atypical for legitimate setup scripts. The command creates a reverse shell, which is malicious behavior. The presence of such code in a setup script is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command class that, during installation, executes a reverse shell to an external server ('e6j4342057.zicp.fun') on port 26264. The command is constructed as a string, base64-encoded, and then decoded and executed via os.system. The code's purpose appears malicious, aiming to establish unauthorized remote access during installation. The obfuscated class name and variable names suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent. No other legitimate setup functionalities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior—specifically, establishing a reverse shell connection during package installation. This behavior is malicious and poses significant security risks. The code is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious malware.",
