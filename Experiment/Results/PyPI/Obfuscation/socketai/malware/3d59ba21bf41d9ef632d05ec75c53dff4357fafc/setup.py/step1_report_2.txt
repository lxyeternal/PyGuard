  "purpose": "Custom setup script that, during installation, attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The class method UJDddaNJYeklFuDwXpcvWvZUncZzhOwn, which constructs a command string and encodes it in base64.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing the decoded base64-encoded command, which initiates a reverse shell connection to an external server.",
  "flows": "The method constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, then executes it via os.system after decoding, leading to a network connection to the attacker's server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names, dynamic command generation, base64 encoding, and execution of a reverse shell command during installation process.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that overrides the install method. Inside, it constructs a reverse shell command that connects back to an external server (e6j4342057.zicp.fun) on port 26264, spawning a bash shell. The command string is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via os.system, which is a common technique to evade static detection. The execution occurs during the package's installation phase, meaning any user installing this package inadvertently runs malicious code. The presence of obfuscated class and method names further suggests malicious intent. Overall, this is a clear attempt to embed a remote backdoor in a Python package during installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, attempting to establish a reverse shell connection to an external server during package installation. The obfuscated naming, dynamic command construction, and use of base64 encoding to hide the malicious payload strongly indicate malicious behavior. Immediate removal or blocking of this package is recommended.",
