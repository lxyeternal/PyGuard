{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to execute a reverse shell connection to an external server during package installation, indicating malicious intent to gain remote access.",
  "sources": "The method UJDddaNJYeklFuDwXpcvWvZUncZzhOwn constructs a command string with hardcoded domain and port, then encodes it in base64.",
  "sinks": "The decoded base64 command is executed via os.system, which initiates a network connection and spawns a bash shell, providing remote access.",
  "flows": "Source: construction of the base64-encoded reverse shell command -> decoding during runtime -> execution via os.system -> establishing reverse shell to external host.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, base64 encoding of the payload, execution during setup, hardcoded external domain and port, use of os.system for command execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated install class that, during installation, constructs a reverse shell command targeting a specific external server. The command is base64-encoded to evade static detection, then decoded and executed at runtime, establishing a remote connection and spawning a bash shell. The obfuscation and dynamic execution are typical of malicious payloads aiming to create backdoors. The code's behavior is clearly malicious, with high severity and risk, as it grants remote shell access during package installation. The use of hardcoded external addresses and obfuscation techniques further confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=1, securityRisk=1, obfuscated=0.8-1) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-severity malicious backdoor that establishes a reverse shell during package installation. Its obfuscation and encoded payload are typical evasion techniques. The malicious intent is clear and severe, warranting immediate removal and flagging of the package.",
