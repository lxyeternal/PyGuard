{
  "purpose": "The code registers an atexit handler that, upon script termination, collects system information (public IP, hostname, script path), encodes it in base64, writes a proof message to a local file, and sends the data to an external suspicious domain. It also contains obfuscated variable names, indicating concealment of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Network requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org'; reading system info via os.uname(); writing to 'pocbykotko.txt'; reading script path via pathlib.",
  "sinks": "External HTTP GET requests transmitting encoded system info; writing 'proof bug by kotko' to local file during exit.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system info collection (IP, hostname, path) through encoding, then via HTTP request to external domain; also, a local file is written during program exit.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; network activity during package setup; data collection and exfiltration without user consent; writing proof message indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert data exfiltration by collecting system information during package installation, encoding it, and sending it to a suspicious external domain during exit. Obfuscated variable names and network requests are typical indicators of malicious intent. No active payloads or destructive commands are present, but the exfiltration behavior is serious. The code's actions are consistent with malicious surveillance or data theft. The external domain and encoding further suggest an attempt to hide malicious activity. The overall behavior warrants high suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious exfiltration behavior during package installation, with obfuscation and external communication indicating malicious intent. It should be considered highly dangerous and avoided.",
