{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with installation scripts, including custom behaviors during install.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs ('https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org'), reading from __file__ directory, writing to 'pocbykotko.txt', environment variables, and os.uname() data.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external domains, writing to local file 'pocbykotko.txt', and possibly sending encoded data via requests to 'kotko.org'.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'install' class executes a function that collects IP address, hostname, and file path, encodes this data, and sends it to an external domain ('kotko.org').",
  "anomalies": "The code registers a function to run on exit that collects and transmits system info and IP address, encoding it in base64, then sending it over an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain. The code writes a proof message to a local file during exit. Variable names are obfuscated and do not clearly indicate their purpose. External communication occurs during installation, which is unusual for standard package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code contains obfuscated variable names, which hinder understanding but suggest concealment. It defines a custom install class that registers a function to run at exit, which gathers system information, such as IP address ('https://api.ipify.org'), hostname, and file path. It encodes this data in base64 and sends it via a GET request to 'https://kotko.org'. Additionally, it writes 'proof bug by kotko' to a local file 'pocbykotko.txt'. These behaviors are typically associated with data exfiltration or reconnaissance activities, especially because they occur during package installation without explicit user consent. The external domains used are suspicious and do not correspond to known safe services. The obfuscated variables further indicate an intent to conceal malicious or undesired behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system and network information and transmitting it to an external server during package installation, coupled with writing evidence to a local file. Obfuscation and external communication during setup strongly suggest malicious intent. This package should be considered dangerous and avoided.",
