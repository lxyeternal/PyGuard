{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with additional code that executes during installation or development commands.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URL (https://api.ipify.org and https://kotko.org), reading and writing to a local file 'pocbykotko.txt', reading environment info (os.uname()), and obtaining the script's file path.",
  "sinks": "External HTTP GET requests, writing to a local file, and sending encoded data via an HTTP GET request to 'kotko.org'.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code registers a function that, upon execution, retrieves the system's external IP, hostname, and script path; encodes these data and sends them to an external server (kotko.org). It also writes a proof message to a local file.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs network requests to external servers during installation, collects system information, encodes it, and exfiltrates it without any explicit user consent. The obfuscated variable names and the use of 'atexit' for network operations suggest possible malicious intent. The base64 encoding and the external communication are suspicious. No input validation or sanitization is observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a setup script using setuptools, which is normal. However, it registers an 'atexit' function that runs upon program termination, which performs several suspicious actions: it writes a message to a file, fetches the public IP address, gathers system hostname, encodes system path, and then sends this data to an external server. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking. The variable names are obfuscated, which is often a tactic to hide malicious code. The external URL 'kotko.org' is suspicious and not commonly associated with legitimate package behavior. Overall, the code’s network activity and data collection point toward malicious exfiltration behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign-looking setup script but contains malicious activity: it collects system info and sends it to an external server during installation. The obfuscation, external network requests, and data encoding strongly suggest data exfiltration. It should be considered malicious behavior and not trusted.",
