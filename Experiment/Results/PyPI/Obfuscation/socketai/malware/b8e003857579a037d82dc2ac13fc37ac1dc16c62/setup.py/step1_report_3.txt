{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package with additional obfuscated or intentionally complex functions, possibly for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or surveillance.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the network via requests.get calls (e.g., https://api.ipify.org and https://kotko.org), and from the filesystem (reading README.md and writing to pocbykotko.txt). Environment data is gathered via os.uname() and current file path.",
  "sinks": "Data from sources is sent via HTTP GET requests to external domains, including an obfuscated base64-encoded string sent to https://kotko.org. The code writes to a local file 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "flows": "Network data (public IP, host info, file path) is gathered, encoded, and sent to external domains. Additionally, the script writes proof text to a local file. These flows suggest data exfiltration or surveillance activities.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, redundant imports, and complex, hard-to-read function definitions. The code registers a cleanup function that executes on exit, which performs network requests and file writes. The requests to external domains and the encoding of data are suspicious. The request URL includes a potentially malicious domain ('kotko.org') and encoded data, indicating potential data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script uses obfuscated variable names and imports, likely to conceal intent. It registers a cleanup function that executes upon script termination, which writes a proof message to a local file and then collects system information (public IP, hostname, file path). It encodes this data in base64 and sends it via a GET request to an external domain. The use of such techniques, along with obfuscation, suggests malicious intent such as covert data collection. The setup process itself appears normal but is used as a vehicle for hidden data exfiltration during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to perform covert data collection and exfiltration during the installation process of a Python package. Obfuscated variables, network requests to suspicious domains, and data encoding strongly suggest malicious intent. It is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
