{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configurations for a Python package using setuptools, including custom install and develop commands.",
  "sources": "The function notmalfunc() executes os.system() with code decoded from a base64-encoded string, which could be an input or data source.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executes the decoded string, which may run arbitrary code or commands on the system.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded by b64d(), then passed to os.system() in notmalfunc(), executing potentially arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded code executed via os.system(); the string 'CODE_REPLACE' suggests placeholder or obfuscation. No other suspicious code, but the pattern indicates potential for hidden malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and defines functions for decoding base64 data and executing it via os.system(). The function notmalfunc() executes a decoded string with os.system(), which is a high-risk sink. The base64 string is currently a placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE', implying this could be replaced with malicious code. The custom install and develop commands invoke notmalfunc() during installation or development setup, meaning any embedded code would run during package setup. The structure is straightforward but contains a mechanism (base64 decoding and execution) commonly used in malicious payloads to conceal code. The overall logic indicates potential malicious intent if the placeholder is replaced with harmful code.",
  "conclusion": "This package setup code contains a potential malicious backdoor mechanism through the execution of base64-encoded code during installation or development. The placeholder suggests the code could be replaced with malicious payloads, posing a significant security risk.",
