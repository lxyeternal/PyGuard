{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'gasmanez' with custom install and develop commands that execute additional functions during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads a base64-encoded string in the function 'notmalfunc' which is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executes the decoded string, which could be arbitrary code, leading to potential remote code execution if the decoded content is malicious.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string in 'notmalfunc' is decoded and passed directly to os.system, executing the code contained within that string during installation or development setup.",
  "anomalies": "The use of base64 decoding followed by os.system to run the decoded string is suspicious; it could be used to hide malicious code. The string 'CODE_REPLACE' indicates placeholder content, which may be replaced with actual malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines a function 'b64d' for decoding base64 strings. The 'notmalfunc' function decodes a base64 string and executes it using os.system, which is inherently dangerous. The 'AfterDevelop' class inherits from 'develop' but does nothing extra. The 'AfterInstall' class runs 'notmalfunc' during installation, meaning any code in the base64 string will be executed at install time. The presence of the placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE' suggests the actual payload is not provided here, but the structure allows executing arbitrary code during package installation, which is a serious security risk if misused.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes arbitrary decoded content during installation via os.system, which is a major security concern. While the placeholder indicates the actual malicious code is not present, the structure allows for malicious payloads to be embedded and executed. This pattern is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
