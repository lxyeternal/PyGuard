  "conclusion": "The code pattern of decoding base64 and executing it during setup constitutes a serious security vulnerability, capable of executing malicious payloads. The placeholder `'CODE_REPLACE'` indicates the code is designed to be replaced with malicious content, making this a high supply chain risk. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified. This pattern should be avoided in production code due to its potential for abuse."
