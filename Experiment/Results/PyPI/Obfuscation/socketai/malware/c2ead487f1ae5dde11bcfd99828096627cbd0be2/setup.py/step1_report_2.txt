{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to configure the packaging and installation process for a Python project named 'gasmanez'.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'b64d' function which decodes a base64-encoded string; 'notmalfunc' calls 'os.system' with decoded code.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' call in 'notmalfunc' executes code decoded from base64, which could be malicious if the string is controlled or tampered with.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string in 'notmalfunc' flows into 'b64d', which decodes it, then is executed via 'os.system' in 'notmalfunc'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and execution of decoded code through 'os.system' is unusual in setup scripts, indicating potential malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'b64d' function to decode base64 strings, then uses this in 'notmalfunc' to decode a string and execute it via 'os.system'. The 'notmalfunc' is called during the 'AfterInstall' class run method, meaning it executes during installation. The presence of a base64 decoding function and execution of decoded code is suspicious, as it could conceal malicious code. The actual payload is hidden inside the base64 string, which is currently a placeholder ('CODE_REPLACE'). The overall structure suggests that the script is designed to execute arbitrary code upon installation, which poses significant security risks if the payload is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains potentially malicious behavior: decoding and executing arbitrary code during installation. The placeholder indicates intentional obfuscation or an incomplete payload, but the structure is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
