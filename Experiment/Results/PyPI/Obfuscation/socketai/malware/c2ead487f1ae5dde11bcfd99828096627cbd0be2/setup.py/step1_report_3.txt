  "sinks": "The os.system call executing decoded base64 code, which could run arbitrary commands.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string is decoded by b64d and then executed via os.system in notmalfunc during install.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and dynamic execution via os.system with decoded code is unusual and potentially suspicious. The placeholder string 'CODE_REPLACE' indicates obfuscation or incomplete code, but the structure suggests possible dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup and defines functions for decoding base64-encoded code. The notmalfunc function decodes a base64 string and executes it via os.system, which is a common vector for malicious code execution if the encoded string is malicious. The base64 string currently is 'CODE_REPLACE', a placeholder, but if replaced with actual code, it could execute arbitrary commands during installation. The custom install and develop classes invoke notmalfunc during setup, increasing risk if the payload is malicious. Overall, the code itself is not malicious but has the capability to execute arbitrary code dynamically, which is a security concern if the encoded payload is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code potentially allows execution of arbitrary code during package installation via decoded base64 content, which could be malicious if the payload is harmful. The current placeholder reduces immediate risk, but the structure indicates a capability for malicious behavior if used improperly.",
