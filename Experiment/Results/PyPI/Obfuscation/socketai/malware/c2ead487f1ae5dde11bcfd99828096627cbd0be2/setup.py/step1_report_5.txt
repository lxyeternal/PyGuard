  "sinks": "os.system() execution of decoded code, which could run arbitrary code on the host system.",
  "flows": "b64d decodes base64 string -> notmalfunc() calls os.system() with decoded string -> executes potentially malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a base64-encoded string passed to os.system(), suggesting obfuscation or hiding of code; no actual code is present in the snippet, only placeholder text.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to decode base64-encoded data and another function that executes this decoded data via os.system(). Custom setup commands AfterDevelop and AfterInstall invoke these functions, with notmalfunc() being called during installation. The decoded string is a placeholder ('CODE_REPLACE') indicating that malicious code could be injected or replaced here. The use of base64 decoding and execution via os.system raises suspicion of potential malicious behavior, especially if the decoded content contains harmful commands. No other suspicious activity such as credential handling or data exfiltration is evident. Given the obfuscation method and execution of external code, this pattern is often associated with malicious intent, especially in supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The script has a high potential for malicious behavior due to decoding and executing arbitrary code, which could be replaced with malicious payloads. The obfuscation and execution pattern warrants caution. Without further context or actual payload, it cannot be confirmed definitively, but the structure suggests possible malicious intent.",
