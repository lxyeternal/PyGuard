  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on code analysis.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, command-line arguments, code execution functions ('exec', 'eval'), hardcoded strings, unvalidated inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system operations, system commands, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input sources (env vars, args) leading to dynamic code execution or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec'/'eval', obfuscation, hardcoded strings, lack of input validation, suspicious variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits suspicious traits such as dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and unvalidated inputs, which are common indicators of malicious intent. The scores assigned—malware at 0.4, obfuscation at 0.6, and security risk at 0.65—are consistent with these observations, reflecting moderate suspicion without definitive proof. Other reports lack code and appropriately assign low risk scores. Slightly increasing the malware score to 0.5 could better reflect the suspicion, but 0.4 remains reasonable given the evidence. Overall, the assessments are justified and align with the described code traits.",
  "conclusion": "The primary report indicates moderate suspicion due to dynamic execution and obfuscation, warranting a malware score of 0.4–0.5. Other reports correctly reflect minimal or no risk owing to lack of code. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no significant adjustments are necessary.",
