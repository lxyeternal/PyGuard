  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no immediately apparent malicious intent. Its purpose seems to involve some form of data processing or utility functions, but without explicit context or comments, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, user input via input() functions, and potentially from imported modules or files if present.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to the console, files, or network sockets, or performs system modifications such as changing system files or executing commands.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from environment variables or user input (sources), then processed or manipulated, potentially passed through functions or modules, and finally output or sent over network or system channels (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code contains typical constructs without obfuscation or unusual language features. No hidden or malicious imports detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard input/output and environment variable usage. No unsafe SQL, code injection, or insecure practices are visible. No data exfiltration, system damage, or covert communication detected. The structure suggests normal utility or script functionality without malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malware indicators.",
