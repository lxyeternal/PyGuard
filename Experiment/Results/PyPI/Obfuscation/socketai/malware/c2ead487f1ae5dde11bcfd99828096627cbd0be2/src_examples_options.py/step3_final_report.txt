  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python package code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, suspicious activities, obfuscation, and data flows.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, user input, external network connections, eval/exec calls, hardcoded secrets, and standard library functions.",
  "sinks": "Console output, file writing, network transmission, dynamic code execution, and potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (outputs, network, eval/exec), potentially via obfuscated or dynamic code paths.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, eval/exec usage, hardcoded secrets, network activity, dynamic code execution, and unusual variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in Reports 1, 3, 4, 5, with no suspicious activity or obfuscation, leading to low malware and security risk scores. Report 2 contains obfuscated code, eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, and network activity, strongly indicating malicious intent, justifying high malware (0.75), obfuscated (0.8), and security risk (0.8) scores. Confidence levels are aligned with the clarity of patterns and evidence. The overall data flow analysis supports these conclusions, with suspicious indicators primarily in Report 2.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risks; Report 2 shows significant malicious indicators, justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. The scoring is consistent with the observed patterns and analysis, providing a reliable assessment of supply chain security risks.",
