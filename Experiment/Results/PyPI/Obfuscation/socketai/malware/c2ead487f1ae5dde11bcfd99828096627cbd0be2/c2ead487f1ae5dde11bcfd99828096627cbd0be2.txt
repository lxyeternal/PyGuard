      "conclusion": "The code pattern of decoding base64 and executing it during setup constitutes a serious security vulnerability, capable of executing malicious payloads. The placeholder `'CODE_REPLACE'` indicates the code is designed to be replaced with malicious content, making this a high supply chain risk. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified. This pattern should be avoided in production code due to its potential for abuse."

The scoring is consistent with the observed patterns and analysis, providing a reliable assessment of supply chain security risks."

      "conclusion": "The primary report indicates moderate suspicion due to dynamic execution and obfuscation, warranting a malware score of 0.4–0.5. Other reports correctly reflect minimal or no risk owing to lack of code. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no significant adjustments are necessary."
