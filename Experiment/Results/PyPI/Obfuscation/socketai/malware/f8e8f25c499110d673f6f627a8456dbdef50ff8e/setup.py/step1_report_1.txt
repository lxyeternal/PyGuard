  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with embedded malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, writing to temporary files, executing system commands, fetching external code via URL.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands, reading external URL content, writing to temporary files.",
  "flows": "Code fetches external content via URL and executes it; system command attempts to start a process with manipulated executable path.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, writing and executing code from a remote URL, attempting to execute a manipulated executable, unusual import structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, creates a temporary file, writes Python code that fetches and executes remote code from a URL, and then attempts to run a manipulated executable. The remote code execution via 'exec(_uurlopen(...).read())' indicates malicious intent, likely to execute arbitrary code from an external source. The obfuscated variable names and indirect execution methods are typical of malicious obfuscation. The system call attempts to run a modified executable, which is suspicious. The overall structure suggests malicious intent, possibly to establish persistence or execute malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior, including remote code fetching and execution, obfuscated code, and suspicious system call. It appears designed to execute arbitrary code from an external source, representing a high security risk.",
