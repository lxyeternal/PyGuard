{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with an installation script that includes a potentially malicious code execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from an external URL using urlopen within an exec() call.",
  "sinks": "exec() executing code fetched from an external URL; system call to open a process with modified executable name.",
  "flows": "urlopen from external URL -> exec() executes downloaded code; system() runs modified executable with filename from _eexecutable.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual obfuscated variable names; fetching and executing code from an external URL; attempting to run a system command with modified executable name.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup, tempfile, sys, os modules. It creates a temporary file and writes Python code that fetches content from a remote URL and executes it via exec(), which is highly suspicious. It then attempts to run a system command with a modified executable filename, potentially to execute something malicious. The setup function indicates package installation details, but the core malicious behavior is the external code fetch and execution, combined with system command execution. These are typical indicators of supply chain malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, including remote code execution and system command execution, indicative of a supply chain attack. It aims to fetch and run malicious code from an external source and manipulate executable execution, posing significant security risks.",
