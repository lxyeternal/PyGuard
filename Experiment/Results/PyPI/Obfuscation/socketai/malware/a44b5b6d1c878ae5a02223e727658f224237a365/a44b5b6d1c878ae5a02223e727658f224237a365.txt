      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, which is characteristic of malicious payload delivery. The scores across reports are consistent with this behavior. While the exact payload content remains unknown, the overall activity warrants high security concern and caution."
