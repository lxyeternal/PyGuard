  "purpose": "Obfuscated script that appears to decode and execute payloads, potentially malicious, involving encoded strings and dynamic evaluation.",
  "sources": "Decoding functions, base64 and hex-encoded strings, environment variables, and __name__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "eval() function, decode and decode() chaining, decoding payloads and executing decoded code.",
  "flows": "Sources (encoded strings, environment variables, __name__) -> decoding functions -> eval() execution of dynamically decoded code.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code using multiple layers of hex, base64, and string decoding; use of eval() on decoded data; extensive use of string manipulations with hex and base64 encoding; reliance on dynamically generated code paths that obscure intent.",
  "analysis": "The code heavily relies on obfuscation techniques, decoding data from multiple encoded strings, including base64 and hex. It reads from environment variables and __name__, then decodes and processes the data through multiple decoding layers, eventually passing the decoded result to eval(). The presence of eval() on dynamically decoded code is a significant risk, as it suggests execution of potentially malicious payloads. The code does not appear to perform legitimate or benign functions; rather, it seems designed to conceal malicious activities, such as downloading, executing payloads, or exfiltrating data. Its structure suggests an intent to evade detection by obfuscating the data flow and the payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits strong signs of malicious intent, including heavy obfuscation, multiple decoding layers, and execution via eval() of dynamically decoded data. The likelihood is high that it is malicious, designed to execute hidden payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the host system.",
