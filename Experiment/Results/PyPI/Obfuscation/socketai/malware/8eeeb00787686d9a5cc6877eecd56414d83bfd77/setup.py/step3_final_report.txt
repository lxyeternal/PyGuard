  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for a Python project, using obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including package name, version, license, keywords, and install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; potential concern is obfuscated variable names which could hide malicious code or data flows in a broader context.",
  "flows": "No active data flows or code execution paths are present in this static setup script.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names ('SoAWyLDwLEiFnJVQLgAbmvKgWwVNsQqN', 'oTLwBNYsxtOLDCeiVZElCQqeKNDbERxb') and nonsensical package name 'z4vjx9jyjv865n5g'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with obfuscated identifiers, which raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious behavior. No dynamic code, input handling, or network activity is present. The dependencies are common packages, which could be misused if malicious code exists elsewhere. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to conceal intent, but without further context, it remains a suspicion rather than evidence. Malware and risk scores should be low, with high obfuscation scores justified by the nonsensical naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign-looking setup script with obfuscation that warrants caution. No active malicious code or behavior is evident within this snippet. Further review of the full package and source repository is recommended before deployment.",
