      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.65,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a malformed or obfuscated setup script with suspicious dependencies and parameter misuse. While no malicious code or payloads are directly present, the obfuscation and invalid dependencies warrant caution. The package could be malicious if dependencies are maliciously replaced or if obfuscation is used to hide malicious behavior. Overall, moderate suspicion but no confirmed malware."

It should be classified as malware with high confidence, given the potential for remote command execution, data exfiltration, and backdoor functionality."
