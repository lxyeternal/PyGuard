  "conclusion": "The dependency code appears generally safe with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The main risk stems from potential misuse of dynamic code execution with untrusted input, which is acknowledged in the reports. Scores are consistent with the evidence, and continued monitoring of input handling is recommended to mitigate possible exploitation."
