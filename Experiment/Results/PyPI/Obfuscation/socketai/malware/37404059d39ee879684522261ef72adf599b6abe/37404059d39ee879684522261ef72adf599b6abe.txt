      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, obfuscated setup script for a Python package. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The heavy obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the static analysis."

      "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to download and execute remote payloads stealthily, with obfuscation techniques to evade detection. The active remote code execution, combined with obfuscation and hardcoded infrastructure, warrants a high malware and security risk score."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits patterns typical of obfuscation and concealment tactics aimed at hiding malicious behavior. While no explicit malicious actions are visible, the suspicious import pattern, obfuscated identifiers, and namespace cleanup suggest a high potential for malicious intent. Further dynamic analysis and review of the 'frequest' module are recommended to confirm any malicious activity."
