{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data, primarily for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, defining package metadata, and specifying dependencies and package data.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not process untrusted input or send data externally.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow; package metadata and dependencies are statically defined without external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., FLuiZlTiLIlRrNDRJxgSzZsEDDzUdVfN, IWhDmwCCKVauNNWuYkjgFDmFmJOKNrkL, OlNmhfQRODCZZORHTMHIStpGmmCCpncD, etc.) are used throughout, which is unusual for package setup scripts and suggests deliberate obfuscation. The use of such nonsensical variable names is suspicious and indicates attempts to conceal the actual intent or structure of the code.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs standard package setup tasks: reading the README file, defining package metadata, specifying dependencies, and configuring setup parameters. All code is static and lacks dynamic input processing or external data transmission. The unusual variable names are a significant anomaly, possibly intended to obfuscate the code's purpose or hide malicious intent. However, no active malicious operations (e.g., network activity, credential access, or code injection) are present. The obfuscation could be benign or malicious, but without external indicators or code execution, it remains suspicious. The package appears to mimic a legitimate setup script with obfuscated variable names, which warrants cautious review, but no direct malicious behavior is observable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with heavily obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or external data leaks are evident within this fragment. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious intent based on the provided code alone.",
