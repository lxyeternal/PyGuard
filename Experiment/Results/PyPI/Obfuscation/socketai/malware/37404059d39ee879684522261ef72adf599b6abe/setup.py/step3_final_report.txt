  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, defining package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and calling setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data processing present",
  "flows": "Static configuration data flows from variables into setup() parameters without external or dynamic data sources",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names, but no malicious code, network activity, or data leaks detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with obfuscated variable names, which is unusual but not malicious. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is evident. The heavy obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent based solely on static analysis. Dependencies are standard, and no malicious patterns are present. The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide malicious code, but none is found. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.8, risk=0.2) are consistent with the analysis. The code's benign nature is supported by the absence of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, obfuscated setup script for a Python package. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The heavy obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the static analysis.",
