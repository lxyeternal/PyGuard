{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining package metadata; specifying dependencies and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "Metadata and dependencies are set statically; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, e.g., 'FLuiZlTiLIlRrNDRJxgSzZsEDDzUdVfN', 'IWhDmwCCKVauNNWuYkjgFDmFmJOKNrkL'. No actual malicious code or backdoors are evident. The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, likely to hinder readability but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and codecs, reads a README file for long description, and sets package metadata and dependencies. Variables with nonsensical names store metadata and dependency lists. The setup() function is called with parameters, some of which are also obfuscated. There are no network connections, dynamic code execution, or suspicious operations. The obfuscated variable names seem designed to obscure the code but do not correspond to malicious actions. Overall, the code performs typical package setup tasks with obfuscation but no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation appears to be solely for concealment rather than malicious intent. The package appears safe based on this code fragment.",
