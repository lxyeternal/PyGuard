{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process of a Python package, including an asynchronous function that sends system hostname and IP address to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "The asynchronous method AYEeVWwyVcSBwOPLVLJAuClPuXUjWsbg reads system hostname and IP, and prepares to send data via a webhook. It is invoked during installation.",
  "sinks": "The Webhook.send method transmits collected system info to an external Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Code initializes webhook connection, gathers hostname and IP, then asynchronously sends this info to a remote server during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated class and method names, performs network communication during installation, and transmits system data externally, which is unusual behavior for a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class inheriting from 'install' with an async method that sends system hostname and IP to a hardcoded Discord webhook. The method is invoked within the install process, causing network activity during package setup. The code's obfuscated naming and the active network communication to an external service during install are suspicious. The dependencies include 'discord.py' and 'aiohttp', which are used for web communication. Overall, the code performs unauthorized data exfiltration during package installation, which is malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent by exfiltrating system information during installation via a Discord webhook. The obfuscated naming, network activity during setup, and data transmission to an external server are clear indicators of malicious behavior.",
