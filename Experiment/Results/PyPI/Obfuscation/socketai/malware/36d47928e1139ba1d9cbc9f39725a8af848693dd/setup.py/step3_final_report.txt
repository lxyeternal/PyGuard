{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setuptools install class with an async method that collects hostname and IP address and sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The method reads hostname and IP address via socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname(), and imports external libraries discord.py and aiohttp.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to an external Discord webhook URL, transmitting system hostname and IP address during setup.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from socket functions and transmitted via the webhook connection during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'async def' within a class inheriting from 'install', which is synchronous; invalid dependency 'sockets' instead of 'socket'; obfuscated class and method names; network activity during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The code exfiltrates system hostname and IP address to an external Discord webhook during package installation, indicating malicious intent. The use of an async function in a synchronous setup class is flawed and unlikely to execute properly, but the intent to send data is clear. The dependency 'sockets' is invalid, likely a typo or obfuscation. Obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. The code's behavior, combined with hardcoded webhook URL and network activity during setup, points to active data exfiltration, a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation, with obfuscation and flawed implementation. It should be considered high risk and malicious.",
