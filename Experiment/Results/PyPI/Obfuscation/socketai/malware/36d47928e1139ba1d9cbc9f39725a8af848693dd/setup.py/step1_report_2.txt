{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for package installation and includes an asynchronous function that sends system hostname and IP address information to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname and IP address using socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname().",
  "sinks": "Sends data to a Discord webhook URL via the discord.Webhook API using aiohttp session.",
  "flows": "On installation, the custom install command executes asynchronously, collecting hostname and IP, then transmitting this data to an external server (Discord webhook).",
  "anomalies": "Uses an asynchronous method within a setuptools install class, which is unconventional. The code includes obfuscated class and variable names. It transmits system info without user consent, which is suspicious. The import of 'socket' and 'discord' and the transmission of system info are unusual for a typical package installer.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the install process with an asynchronous method. This method imports 'discord' and 'aiohttp' libraries, establishes a session, and sends system hostname and IP address to a specified Discord webhook URL. The data collection and transmission occur during package installation, which is atypical and potentially malicious. The use of obfuscated class and variable names suggests an attempt to conceal intent. The use of 'async' within the install class and the immediate sending of system info without explicit user consent are suspicious behaviors. The code's primary purpose appears to be to exfiltrate system information during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting and transmitting system information to an external server during installation. The obfuscated naming and unconventional implementation further support malicious intent. It poses a security risk and should be considered malicious malware embedded within the package.",
