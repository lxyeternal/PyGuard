  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to the stealthy, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during package setup. The use of encoded commands, hidden execution, and error suppression indicates malicious intent, warranting further decoding and analysis of the payload. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious."
