  "purpose": "Download and execute a remote executable file from a URL, saving it to a specific directory, then running it.",
  "sources": "requests.get() fetches remote content from the specified URL.",
  "sinks": "open() writes the downloaded content to 'main.exe'; os.startfile() executes the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves content -> open().write() saves content -> Path().rename() moves file -> os.startfile() executes the file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obfuscated variable names; downloads executable from a Discord CDN URL; writes to a system directory (~SXK); executes a downloaded file without validation.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a directory in a system path (~SXK) if it doesn't exist, then downloads an executable from an external source (Discord CDN). It saves the executable with a misleading filename and executes it immediately. The code obfuscates its purpose through unclear variable names and indirect file operations. Downloading and executing remote executables without validation is highly suspicious and indicates potential malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable without validation, potentially indicating malware. It attempts to run an untrusted file from a remote source, which is a common tactic in malicious payload delivery.",
