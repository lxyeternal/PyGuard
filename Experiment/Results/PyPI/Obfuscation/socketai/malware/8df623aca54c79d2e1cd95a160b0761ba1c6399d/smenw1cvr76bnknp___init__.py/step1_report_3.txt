{
  "purpose": "Download and execute a file from a remote URL, saving it to a specific directory and then executing it.",
  "sources": "requests.get() fetches remote data; open() reads/writes files; os.startfile() executes the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "open() writes to disk; os.startfile() executes the downloaded file, potentially running malicious code.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves data from URL -> writes to 'main.exe' -> renames to target directory -> executes the file.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded URL pointing to an executable; suspicious directory path; renaming and immediate execution of downloaded content.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a directory at a Windows system path, downloads an executable from a remote server, saves it with a misleading filename, renames it to a system directory, and executes it without validation. These behaviors are typical in malicious supply chain attacks and remote code execution attempts. The code does not include any validation, checksums, or sandbox detections. The hardcoded URL and automatic execution are red flags indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and exhibits behaviors consistent with malware delivery mechanisms, including remote payload download, file masquerading, and silent execution. It should be considered malicious and dangerous to run.",
