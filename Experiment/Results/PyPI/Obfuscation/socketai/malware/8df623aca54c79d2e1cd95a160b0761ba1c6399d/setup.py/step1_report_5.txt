{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with dependencies, but its main function involves downloading and executing remote files, likely malicious payloads, from suspicious URLs.",
  "sources": "Requests to two URLs hosting executable files; reading from network responses.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded content to executable files; executing files with os.startfile; deleting files and directories.",
  "flows": "Requests response → writing files ('ZYXMN.exe', 'ZYRBX.exe') → renaming files to system directory → executing files via os.startfile → cleaning up files.",
  "anomalies": "Download of executable files from Discord CDN URLs; renaming files into a system directory with suspicious names; executing downloaded files without verification; creation of a directory with a Windows-like name; broad exception handling that suppresses errors; inclusion of malicious behavior within a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by defining package metadata and dependencies, which is normal for a setup script. However, it then creates a directory in a system path, which is suspicious. It proceeds to download two executable files from URLs hosted on Discord's CDN, a common tactic for distributing malicious payloads. The files are saved and renamed into a system-like directory. The script then executes these files without any validation or user consent, which is typical malicious behavior aimed at persistence or payload execution. It also attempts to clean up the files and directory afterward. The usage of broad try-except blocks suppresses errors, potentially hiding failures or detection attempts. Overall, the code exhibits behavior consistent with malware delivery, including downloading, executing, and cleaning up malicious payloads, with no legitimate purpose evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates malicious intent through the download and execution of external executable files from untrusted sources, with attempts to disguise their location within system directories. It exhibits typical malware behavior, such as covert downloads, silent execution, and cleanup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious activity.",
