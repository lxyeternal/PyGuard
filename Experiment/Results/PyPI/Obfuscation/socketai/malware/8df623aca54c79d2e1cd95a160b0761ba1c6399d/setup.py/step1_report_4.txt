{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for packaging and setup, but it also includes actions that suggest malicious intent, such as downloading and executing potentially harmful files from external sources.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs for executable files, reading and writing files ('ZYXMN.exe', 'ZYRBX.exe') and manipulating file paths, creation of a hidden directory (C:\\$Windows.~SXK).",
  "sinks": "Writing files to the disk, executing downloaded files via os.startfile, removing files and directories, renaming files to appear as system files.",
  "flows": "External URLs (sources) → Downloaded content written to disk → Files renamed/moved to system directories → Files executed via os.startfile",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URLs pointing to executables, creation of a hidden directory, silent removal of files, renaming downloaded files to mimic system files, no validation or checksum verification of downloaded files, attempts to execute these files, usage of common Windows temp-like directory for malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools for packaging but then proceeds to create a directory in a system location that appears hidden. It downloads two executable files from suspicious URLs, saves them with specific filenames, renames them to appear as legitimate system files, and executes them. It then cleans up by deleting the original download files and attempts to delete the directory. These behaviors are characteristic of malware or malicious scripts aiming to deliver payloads covertly and execute them on the host system.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains multiple malicious indicators, including downloading and executing external executables, disguising files as system components, and cleaning up traces. The use of hardcoded URLs and system path manipulations strongly suggests malicious intent, likely for malware delivery or system compromise.",
