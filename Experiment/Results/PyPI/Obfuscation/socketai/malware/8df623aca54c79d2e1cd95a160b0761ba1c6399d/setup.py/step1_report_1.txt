{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to download and execute two executable files from specified URLs, then rename them and run them from a specific directory.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs for downloading executable files; reading from the network; writing files to disk.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded content to files ('ZYXMN.exe' and 'ZYRBX.exe'), executing these files with os.startfile, and removing temporary files.",
  "flows": "Download executable files from URLs -> save as local files -> rename to system directory -> execute files -> cleanup temporary files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, download and execute external files without validation, files are stored in a Windows system directory ('C:\\$Windows.~SXK'), immediate execution of downloaded files, silent removal of temporary files, no verification of downloaded content or checksums.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a directory under 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK', downloads two executable files from Discord CDN links, saves and renames them into the directory, then executes these files. The URLs point to executable files (.exe), which are executed without any validation or user consent. Temporary files are promptly deleted after use. The obfuscated variable names and the pattern of downloading and executing files from external sources strongly suggest malicious activity aimed at establishing persistent or malicious processes, potentially as part of malware or a backdoor. The script does not perform any apparent legitimate function and hides its activity by obfuscation techniques and lack of transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, exhibiting typical malware behaviors such as downloading and executing remote payloads, hiding files in system directories, and not validating downloaded content. These actions indicate malicious intent, likely to infect or compromise the host system. It is recommended to treat this code as malicious.",
