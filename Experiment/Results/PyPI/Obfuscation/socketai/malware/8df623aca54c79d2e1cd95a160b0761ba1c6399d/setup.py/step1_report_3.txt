{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it also contains malicious behavior involving downloading and executing external executables.",
  "sources": "The code reads URLs for malicious executables and creates a directory ('C:\\$Windows.~SXK') to store and execute downloaded files.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded files ('ZYXMN.exe' and 'ZYRBX.exe') are written to disk and executed using 'os.startfile', which can run malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "URL requests (sources) fetch executable content → files are saved locally → files are renamed and executed → potentially malicious code runs on the system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URLs pointing to suspicious Discord CDN links; creation of a directory within a Windows system directory; downloading and executing .exe files; attempts to delete the directory after execution; naming of files with misleading or system-like prefixes.",
  "analysis": "The code begins as a package setup script but quickly diverges into malicious activity by creating a directory in a Windows system folder. It downloads two executables from suspicious URLs, saves them with misleading names, and executes them. It then attempts to clean up the directory. The use of 'try-except' blocks suppresses errors, making malicious activities less detectable. The actions suggest intent to run unauthorized or harmful software on the host system.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior, including downloading and executing external executables from untrusted sources, hiding files within system-like directories, and attempting to remove traces. Its primary intent appears to be to infect or control the system remotely or maliciously. The overall security risk is high.",
