  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package but includes code to download and execute files from external URLs, potentially maliciously.",

    "Renaming and executing files without validation",
    "Writing files directly to a Windows system directory ('$Windows.~SXK')",
    "Using broad exception handling that suppresses errors, obscuring failures"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code's core behavior involves fetching two executables from Discord CDN URLs, saving them locally, moving them into a system directory, executing them, and then cleaning up. This pattern indicates malicious intent, as it resembles a typical dropper or downloader used in malware campaigns. The code is embedded within a package setup script, hiding malicious activity under the guise of package configuration. It lacks input validation, and the URLs are hardcoded, which strongly suggests malicious purpose. The use of broad try-except blocks further conceals failures that might reveal malicious activity. Overall, the script is designed to download and execute potentially harmful files from external sources.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and appears to be malicious. It downloads and runs executables from untrusted external URLs, storing them in a system directory and executing them silently. The behavior aligns with common malware tactics to infect or compromise systems. The context of its inclusion in a setup script indicates it might be part of a supply chain attack or malicious package distribution.",
