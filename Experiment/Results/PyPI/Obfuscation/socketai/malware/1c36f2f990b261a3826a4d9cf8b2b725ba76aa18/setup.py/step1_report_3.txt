{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup with a custom install command that executes decryption and code execution on Windows systems during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment data (os.name), and retrieves encrypted data which is decrypted and executed at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code, which is potentially malicious if the decrypted payload contains harmful instructions.",
  "flows": "The code checks if the OS is Windows, then decrypts and executes code via exec(), which is a high-risk source-to-sink flow. This occurs during the custom install process.",
  "anomalies": "The use of encrypted strings and runtime execution via exec() indicate obfuscation and dynamic code execution. The decryption key and data are hardcoded, which is suspicious. The code appears designed to execute arbitrary code during installation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a custom install class. During installation on Windows, it decrypts an encrypted string using Fernet, then executes the resulting code with exec(). The decryption key and data are hardcoded, which suggests obfuscation and potential malicious intent. The package name and version are generic, with no clear purpose. The package dependencies are standard libraries ('fernet' and 'requests'), but their use in combination with dynamic code execution indicates a security risk. Overall, the code exhibits malicious behavior, likely designed to run arbitrary code on Windows machines during installation, which is a common supply chain attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code designed to execute arbitrary, decrypted code during installation on Windows systems. The use of hardcoded decryption data and exec() indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, posing significant security risks.",
