{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package with custom installation behavior, possibly including code that executes upon installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, checks OS type, and imports modules like requests and fernet; it also executes decrypted code within the installation process.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous code execution via exec() with decrypted data; use of requests module; decryption of embedded data that could be malicious.",
  "flows": "Environment check -> import requests and Fernet -> decrypt and execute code via exec() -> proceed with standard setup",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted data executed at runtime, suspicious variable names, code that only runs on Windows, and unusual obfuscated strings and method names. Use of exec() with decrypted content is highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration that defines a custom install class. During installation on Windows ('nt'), it imports requests and Fernet, decrypts a string with Fernet, and executes the decrypted code via exec(). The presence of encrypted payloads and dynamic code execution during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The obfuscated variable names and encrypted data strongly suggest concealment of malicious activities. The code's primary purpose appears to be running arbitrary code during installation, which can be exploited for malicious purposes such as backdoors or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains suspicious behavior with encrypted code executed at install time, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The use of decryption and exec(), combined with environment-specific execution, strongly suggests malicious activity designed to conceal its true purpose. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
