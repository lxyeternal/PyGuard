{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup process that, during installation on Windows, decrypts and executes a payload using a hardcoded key and encrypted data, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads the encrypted key and ciphertext, and during install, imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' to decrypt and execute code.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted code is executed via exec(), which can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Source: hardcoded encrypted data and decryption key -> decryption process -> exec() of decrypted code during install on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload, obfuscated variable names, conditional execution only on Windows, use of exec() with decrypted code, hardcoded cryptographic material.",
  "analysis": "The script decrypts a payload only on Windows systems and executes it via exec(), which is a common malicious tactic to conceal harmful code. The obfuscated variable names and embedded encrypted strings suggest an attempt to evade detection. The use of a hardcoded key and ciphertext, combined with the conditional execution, indicates deliberate concealment of malicious activity. The import of 'requests' and 'Fernet' during install further supports the possibility of network-based malicious actions. The code's behavior aligns with supply chain attack patterns, executing arbitrary code during package installation, which poses a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains high-probability malicious behavior, decrypting and executing code during installation on Windows, with obfuscation and encrypted payloads. The overall security risk is very high, and the package should be considered malicious.",
