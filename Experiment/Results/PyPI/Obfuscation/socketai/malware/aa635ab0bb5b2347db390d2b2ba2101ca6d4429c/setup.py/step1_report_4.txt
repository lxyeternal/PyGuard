  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "User input (install_requires list), static string assignment",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data being sent or received directly within this code",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Variable name 'vxlBlVcvJxyEyPVCUCedVGNZZvrBAgvw' appears obfuscated or nonsensical, but is unused; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a version variable with a nonsensical name. The setup function is called with a package name and a list of dependencies, including 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. These dependencies, by themselves, are common and not malicious. No input sources, data leaks, or malicious actions are present. The variable with an obfuscated name is unused, indicating no hidden behavior or obfuscation attempts. Overall, the code is a straightforward setup script with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The presence of an obfuscated variable name appears benign and unused. There are no indications of malware, data leaks, or malicious behavior within this snippet.",
