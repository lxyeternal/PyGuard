{
  "purpose": "A standard Python setup script for package distribution, with an obfuscated variable name and a nonsensical package name.",
  "sources": "The version string assigned to 'vxlBlVcvJxyEyPVCUCedVGNZZvrBAgvw' (unused), dependencies listed in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no network connections or code execution beyond package setup.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name 'vxlBlVcvJxyEyPVCUCedVGNZZvrBAgvw' and nonsensical package name 'mzhkjedjkc8mbtx0'; variable is unused.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with superficial obfuscation through nonsensical variable and package names. No dynamic code, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation appears to be a superficial attempt to hide identifiers but does not impact functionality or indicate malicious intent. The dependencies are common and benign. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0.2–0.7, risk=0.1–0.2—are consistent with the benign nature of this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation scores could be slightly standardized around 0.3, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the package poses minimal security risk.",
