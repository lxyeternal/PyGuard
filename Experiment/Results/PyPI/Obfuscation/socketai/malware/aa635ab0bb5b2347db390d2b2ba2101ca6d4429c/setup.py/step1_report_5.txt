  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function call, reading package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Dependencies list 'install_requires' which may fetch external packages; no direct sink of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No user input or external data sources; dependencies are static strings. No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'mzhkjedjkc8mbtx0' appears obfuscated or non-descriptive, which could be suspicious. The variable 'vxlBlVcvJxyEyPVCUCedVGNZZvrBAgvw' is unused but contains a version string, possibly an obfuscation or placeholder. No other suspicious code or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools, specifying dependencies. The variable name appears intentionally obscure, which could suggest an attempt to hide or obfuscate purpose, but no malicious actions are evident. The dependencies listed include popular packages, with no signs of malicious behavior or data exfiltration. The overall code structure is typical and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup configuration with obfuscated variable names that do not appear malicious. There are no signs of malware, malicious data flows, or suspicious behavior. The obfuscation may be to conceal the package purpose but does not imply malicious intent.",
