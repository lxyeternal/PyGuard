  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation scores could be slightly standardized around 0.3, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the package poses minimal security risk."
