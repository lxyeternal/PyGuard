{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be setting up a Python package and executing a hidden PowerShell command, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads from the filesystem ('tahg' directory), and executes a subprocess running encoded PowerShell commands.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess call that runs encoded PowerShell command with hidden window, which can execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' directory -> Executes encoded PowerShell command in background -> Continues setup process.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess with 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and hidden window, suspicious in setup script. No comments or documentation explaining this behavior. The setup function is standard but is accompanied by covert execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'distutils.core.setup' for package setup, which is normal. It then attempts to run a PowerShell command encoded in Base64 if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist, executing this command in a hidden window. The command is obfuscated via Base64 encoding, which is often used to conceal malicious payloads. The command is executed asynchronously with 'subprocess.Popen', and no validation or logging is present. The package setup includes metadata but lacks any validation or safeguards. Overall, the primary concern is the encoded PowerShell command executed covertly, indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior by executing a hidden, encoded PowerShell command without explanation or user awareness, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The setup process appears normal but is coupled with covert activity, likely for malicious purposes.",
