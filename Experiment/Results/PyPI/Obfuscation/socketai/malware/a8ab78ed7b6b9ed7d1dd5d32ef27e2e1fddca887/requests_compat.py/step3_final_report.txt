  "purpose": "Environment setup, module imports, and type aliasing with obfuscated variable names, likely part of a larger library or framework initialization.",
  "sources": "Imports of modules such as chardet/charset_normalizer, sys.version_info, json/simplejson, and URL/HTTP utilities; reading environment info.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; no network activity, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization and environment detection flow; no source-to-sink data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names; no malicious code or suspicious patterns detected; code appears to be standard setup with obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection (Python version), conditional imports for JSON handling, and defines type aliases. Variable names are intentionally obscure, which can be a red flag but are consistent with obfuscation practices. No network activity, data handling, or malicious logic is present. The code is benign setup code, possibly for compatibility or privacy reasons. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The obfuscation level is high but justified by variable naming; the absence of malicious activity aligns with a low malware and security risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign environment setup with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The high obfuscation warrants cautious review in broader context but is not malicious in this fragment. Scores are consistent with the analysis.",
