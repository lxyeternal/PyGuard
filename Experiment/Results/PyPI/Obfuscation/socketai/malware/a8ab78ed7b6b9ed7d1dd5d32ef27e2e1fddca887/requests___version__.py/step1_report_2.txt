  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script for data processing with no clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, or external data sources are not explicitly used in the code.",
  "sinks": "Data output points such as print statements or file writes are present but do not appear to handle untrusted data maliciously.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted inputs; data is processed locally within the code logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code structure is straightforward and lacks obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code shows standard functions and control flow with no indicators of malicious behavior. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present. The code performs typical data transformations without risky operations or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate data processing script with a low likelihood of malicious behavior.",
