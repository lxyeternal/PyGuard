{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility functions for cookie management, wrapping around requests and cookie jar interfaces to facilitate cookie handling in HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Headers from HTTP responses, cookie jar objects, and input parameters such as cookie dictionaries and cookie jars.",
  "sinks": "Cookie headers sent in HTTP requests, modifications to cookie jar objects, and potential data stored or retrieved from cookies.",
  "flows": "Input data (headers, cookie dicts) flow into cookie jar objects, which are then used to generate cookie headers for requests or to retrieve stored cookies.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable names, inconsistent comments, placeholder-like strings, and warnings about O(n) complexity, suggesting possible concealment or proprietary obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a heavily obfuscated utility for cookie management, designed to interface with requests and cookie jars. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful payloads is present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but appears to serve as a protective or proprietary measure rather than malicious intent. The malware score is set to 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity. The obfuscation score is high (0.8), reflecting the heavy obfuscation. The security risk score is moderate (0.3), primarily due to obfuscation concerns. Overall, the code seems to be a standard utility module with obfuscation, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a heavily obfuscated cookie management utility with no signs of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malware. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and the overall security risk is low. Continuous monitoring is recommended if further code is available.",
