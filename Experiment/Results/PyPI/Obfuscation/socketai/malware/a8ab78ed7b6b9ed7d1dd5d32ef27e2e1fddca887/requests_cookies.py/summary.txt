  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a heavily obfuscated cookie management utility with no signs of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malware. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and the overall security risk is low. Continuous monitoring is recommended if further code is available."
