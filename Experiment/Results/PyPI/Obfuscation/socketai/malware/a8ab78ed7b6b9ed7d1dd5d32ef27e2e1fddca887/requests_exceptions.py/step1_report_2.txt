{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes primarily for handling HTTP and JSON decoding errors, with some additional classes containing obfuscated string attributes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for exceptions from urllib3 and a local compat module; class attributes and initializers that assign static string values and handle exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks or external communications; no file I/O, network, or environment variable usage observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; exception classes simply assign static values and re-raise exceptions without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names and attribute names with seemingly random strings, no meaningful variable or class identifiers. Presence of classes with hardcoded string attributes. No dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no handling of user input.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions with obfuscated names, some inheritance, and static string attributes. Exception classes initialize with fixed responses and static strings, with no evidence of malicious payloads or data leaks. The obfuscation appears intended to obscure intent but does not perform any suspicious activity such as network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration. The static string attributes could be used as identifiers or tokens but on their own do not indicate malicious behavior. No functions perform external data access or manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated collection of exception and error classes, with no active malicious behavior or security risks identified. It may be part of a larger obfuscated library, but in isolation, it shows no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
