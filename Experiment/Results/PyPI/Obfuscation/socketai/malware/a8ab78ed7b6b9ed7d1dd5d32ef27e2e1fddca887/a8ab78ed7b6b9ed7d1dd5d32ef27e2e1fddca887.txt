The obfuscation likely aims to conceal purpose rather than indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, but the obfuscation pattern suggests further scrutiny if part of a larger codebase."

Slightly increasing the malware score for report 4 from 0.3 to 0.4 improves alignment with the suspicion level. The overall threat levels remain low to moderate, with the highest concern in report 5 due to dynamic code execution and data exfiltration potential."
