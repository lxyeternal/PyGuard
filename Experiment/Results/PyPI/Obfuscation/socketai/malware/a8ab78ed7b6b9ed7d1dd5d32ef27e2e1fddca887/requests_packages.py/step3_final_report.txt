  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, dynamic imports, user inputs, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, environment variables, file outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and inputs flow into functions that could potentially send data or execute code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports, indirect data handling, potential obfuscation, ambiguous purpose, no explicit malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no direct malicious activity; dynamic imports and environment variable usage raise suspicion but lack concrete malicious actions. Scores are mostly low, with some suspicion in Report 3 due to complex import logic and indirect data flows. The benign nature of other snippets is consistent with their straightforward structure. The malware score should be lowered to 0 across all reports, and the obfuscated score remains justified at 0.4 only for Report 3. Security risk scores can be reduced to 0.1 for Reports 1, 2, 4, 5, and maintained at 0.4 for Report 3 due to ambiguity.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the code appears benign with minimal risk. Suspicion in Report 3 warrants cautious scoring but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Scores should be adjusted to reflect the low threat level.",
