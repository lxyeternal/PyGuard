{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script that contains malicious behaviors such as downloading files from external IPs, executing remote payloads, system modifications, and obfuscation to hide intent.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__version__.py', environment variables, and network requests to specific IP addresses; also imports modules and reads files like README.md.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess calls with shell=True to execute downloaded files, writes files to disk, and makes network requests to external IPs for payloads.",
  "flows": "Network requests fetch remote files; files are written locally; subprocess calls execute these files; system commands modify system state; obfuscated variables obscure control flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, Windows-specific code for privilege checks and remote execution, network activity to suspicious IPs, silent package installation, and indirect code execution paths.",
  "analysis": "The code actively downloads payloads from external IPs, writes them to disk, and executes them via subprocess, often with obfuscated names and Windows-specific commands. It attempts privilege escalation, silently installs packages, and manipulates system files, indicating malicious intent. The obfuscation and network activity are typical of malware or backdoors designed to compromise systems remotely.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, with behaviors consistent with malware, including remote payload delivery, execution, system modifications, and obfuscation. It poses a significant security risk and should be considered malicious.",
