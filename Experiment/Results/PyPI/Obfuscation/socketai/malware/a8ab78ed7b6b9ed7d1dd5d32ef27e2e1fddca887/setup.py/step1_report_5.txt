  "purpose": "This script appears to be a setup and installation script for a Python package, with additional logic for Windows systems to download and execute remote code, potentially maliciously.",
  "sources": "Reads the current script directory, reads version info from a __version__.py file, reads README.md, and on Windows, executes commands involving subprocesses, network requests, and file operations.",
  "sinks": "Executes subprocess commands that download, move, delete files, and run batch scripts. Network requests download external files, which are then executed or moved, indicating potential remote control or payload execution.",
  "flows": "Source: File reads (__version__.py, README.md), sys.version_info; Network request: downloads remote payloads; Sinks: subprocess commands executing downloaded files and batch scripts.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes downloading remote files, executing them via subprocess, moving and deleting files, and running commands that could be used to establish persistence or execute malicious code. The code on Windows executes a sequence of commands that download and run potentially malicious payloads from external IPs. The code is obfuscated with random variable names and complex subprocess calls.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by verifying Python version compatibility. It then defines a custom test command class with parallel test execution, which is typical but does not seem suspicious. The setup configuration loads version info and reads README content for package description. The critical part is the Windows-specific block, which attempts to run system commands that download external files from a fixed IP address ('52.14.229.35') and execute them as batch scripts, which could be malicious. It checks for 'Access is denied' errors, indicating it might attempt to run with administrative privileges. The code includes downloading images or text files, moving them to batch filenames, and executing them, which resembles typical malicious persistence or payload delivery methods. The obfuscation of variable names and the remote IPs strongly suggest malicious intent. The code also suppresses errors, preventing detection of failures in malicious payload execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains highly suspicious behavior, notably downloading external payloads and executing them via subprocess, which is characteristic of malware. The obfuscated variables and remote IPs further support malicious intent. It appears designed to secretly download and execute malicious code on Windows systems, representing a security threat.",
