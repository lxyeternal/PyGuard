{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up and install a Python package, but it includes hidden malicious behavior to exfiltrate system information via a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), import statements for aiohttp, requests, and discord.",
  "sinks": "Webhook.send() method which transmits hostname and IP address to a Discord server.",
  "flows": "The code collects hostname and IP address, then sends this data to an external webhook URL during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a non-descriptive class name, unusual import of potentially unnecessary modules, and sending system info to a webhook during install are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command class that, during package installation, gathers system hostname and IP address, then sends this data to a Discord webhook. The webhook URL is hardcoded and obfuscated by the nonsensical class name. The use of 'install_requires' includes suspicious entries like 'sockets' (which is not a standard package) and unnecessary modules. The code attempts to exfiltrate user system info secretly at install time, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious code that stealthily sends system information to an external server during installation. The obfuscated class name and secret data exfiltration are clear indicators of malicious behavior.",
