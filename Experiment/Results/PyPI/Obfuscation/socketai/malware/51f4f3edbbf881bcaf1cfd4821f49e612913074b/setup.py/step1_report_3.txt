{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup script for a Python package, but includes additional code that sends system information to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), import of requests, discord, aiohttp modules, and the webhook URL",
  "sinks": "Webhook URL to send hostname and IP address data, potentially leaking system info to an external server",
  "flows": "Hostname and IP address are obtained, then sent via Discord webhook to an external URL during installation",
  "anomalies": "Presence of code that transmits system info to an external webhook during installation, which is unusual for setup scripts. The class and method names are obfuscated. The webhook URL is hardcoded. The required modules include 'sockets' (which is incorrect, the correct module name is 'socket'), indicating possible errors or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that overrides the installation process to send system hostname and IP address to a Discord webhook. The data flow involves retrieving hostname and IP, then posting this info to a hardcoded webhook URL. The code imports modules like aiohttp, requests, and discord, which are standard but used here to perform external network communication during package setup. The presence of obfuscated class and method names, hardcoded webhook URL, and data exfiltration behavior during install strongly suggests malicious intent or sabotage, possibly for tracking or unauthorized surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "The script includes malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation via a webhook. The obfuscated code, hardcoded webhook, and network activity are suspicious. This code poses a security risk and should not be used.",
