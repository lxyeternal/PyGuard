  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes custom installation behavior.",

  "sinks": "zvrNgTKXrTRSgEHMRuztXTjcijIJXPou.send()",
  "flows": "hostname and IP address obtained from socket are sent via Discord webhook",
  "anomalies": "Code is obfuscated with non-descriptive class and method names; usage of Discord webhook to send system info, which could be malicious or maliciously used.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, during package installation, imports network and HTTP libraries, retrieves the hostname and IP address, and then sends this information to a specified Discord webhook. The code is obfuscated with misleading class and method names, which is suspicious. The webhook URL is hardcoded and could be used to exfiltrate system information without user consent. The use of the 'requests' and 'aiohttp' libraries suggests network activity, but only socket and discord are actively used for data collection and transmission. There is no user input handling, but the automatic data exfiltration during installation is a malicious behavior, possibly for tracking or malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system hostname and IP address to an external Discord webhook during package installation. Its obfuscated nature and the data transmission indicate malicious intent or backdoor functionality.",
