  "anomalies": "The custom install command gathers hostname and IP info and exfiltrates it to a remote server during installation, which is suspicious behavior. The webhook URL is hardcoded and malicious intent appears likely.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon installation, imports network libraries, retrieves the hostname and IP address, and sends this information to a specified Discord webhook. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the act of sending system info during package install indicates potential malicious activity or data exfiltration. The package dependencies include typical libraries but are irrelevant to the malicious activity. The code’s purpose seems to be stealthy data theft or surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system hostname and IP address during installation to an external server via a Discord webhook. The code is suspicious and potentially harmful, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
