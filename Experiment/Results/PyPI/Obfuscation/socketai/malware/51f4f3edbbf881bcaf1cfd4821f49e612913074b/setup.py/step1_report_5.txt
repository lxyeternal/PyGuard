  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that modifies the install process to perform additional actions.",
  "sources": "Socket hostname and IP address retrieval, webhook URL for Discord, import statements for aiohttp, socket, requests, discord",
  "sinks": "Webhook URL that sends data (hostname and IP address) to Discord server",
  "flows": "During installation, hostname and IP are fetched and sent via Discord webhook",
  "anomalies": "The code sends system information (hostname, IP) to an external Discord webhook during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior. The webhook URL appears hardcoded. The class name and method names are obfuscated. The package name and requirements include suspicious entries like 'sockets' and 'Cmake'.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, when invoked, imports network-related modules and Discord API. It retrieves system hostname and IP address and then sends this information to a Discord webhook URL. The webhook URL is hardcoded and publicly visible, which suggests data exfiltration. The code is executed during package installation, which is abnormal behavior for legitimate packages. The obfuscation and data transmission strongly indicate malicious intent. Other dependencies are standard, but the core malicious activity is the unsolicited data sending.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system data via a Discord webhook during package installation. The obfuscation, hardcoded webhook, and network activity strongly suggest this package is malicious or compromised.",
