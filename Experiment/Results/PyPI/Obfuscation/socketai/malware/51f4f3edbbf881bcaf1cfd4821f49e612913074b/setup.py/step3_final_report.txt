{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system hostname and IP address during package installation by sending this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads hostname and IP address via socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname().",
  "sinks": "The data is sent to the Discord webhook URL using discord.SyncWebhook.from_url() and send().",
  "flows": "System info is collected in variables (hostname, IP) and transmitted directly to the webhook in the send() method.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; use of nonsensical variable names; invalid import 'sockets' instead of 'socket'; hardcoded webhook URL; code performs data exfiltration during install.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during package installation, imports network modules, retrieves hostname and IP, and exfiltrates this data via a hardcoded Discord webhook. The class and method names are intentionally obfuscated, and the code contains an invalid import ('sockets'), suggesting obfuscation or errors. The core malicious behavior—sending system info to an external server—is clearly present. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the data flow is straightforward. The obfuscation and direct exfiltration indicate malicious intent. Despite some logical inconsistencies, the primary activity is malicious exfiltration during install.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized data exfiltration of system hostname and IP address during package installation, confirming malicious activity. Obfuscation and hardcoded webhook further support malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score should be set to 1.0, with obfuscation around 0.8, and security risk at 1.0.",
