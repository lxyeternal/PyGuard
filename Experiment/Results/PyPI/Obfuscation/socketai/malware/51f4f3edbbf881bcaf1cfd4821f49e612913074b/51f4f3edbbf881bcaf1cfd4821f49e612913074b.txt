      "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized data exfiltration of system hostname and IP address during package installation, confirming malicious activity. Obfuscation and hardcoded webhook further support malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score should be set to 1.0, with obfuscation around 0.8, and security risk at 1.0."
