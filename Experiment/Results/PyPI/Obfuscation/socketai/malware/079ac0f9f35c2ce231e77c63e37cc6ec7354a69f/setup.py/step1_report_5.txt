{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious script designed for information theft, credential extraction, and data exfiltration. It includes functions for collecting browser data, cookies, saved passwords, and system information, then sending this data via webhooks or uploading to external servers.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables (e.g., LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), local browser storage and cookies, local files such as login data and cookies, and network requests to external URLs (e.g., Discord webhooks, transfer.sh). It reads data from browser directories, local Chrome/Edge/Opera data, and potentially captures cookies, passwords, and other sensitive info.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests (requests.post, urlopen, requests to transfer.sh and Discord API), file operations (reading/writing cookies, login data, local state, logs), and subprocess calls for process termination or command execution. Also, the script uploads collected tokens and data to external URLs, which could lead to data leakage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as local browser storage, cookies, and login files, through decryption functions and regex extraction, then into functions that upload or send data over the network via webhooks or file uploads. Threaded functions gather passwords, cookies, and tokens concurrently, then report or exfiltrate this information.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes the exec('') call, dynamic installation of modules (requests, pycryptodome), extensive obfuscation with variable names, and functions that extract and decrypt sensitive data. The code also contains a large list of suspicious keywords, hardcoded webhook URLs, and functions that terminate processes like browsers and wallets. The code appears designed to evade detection and perform unauthorized data collection.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a suspicious exec('') call, then attempts to import modules, installing them if missing. It defines functions for retrieving public IP, decrypting data, sending HTTP requests, and capturing browser cookies/passwords. It leverages threading to concurrently collect browser data, cookies, passwords, and tokens, then uploads this data to external servers or webhooks. Many functions target sensitive data such as browser login info, cookies, wallet data, and tokens, often decrypting or parsing encrypted data. The code uses obfuscated variable names and includes logic for process termination of known applications like browsers and wallet software, suggesting malicious intent to exfiltrate data and disable security measures. The code's overall structure and behavior align with typical info-stealer malware, with no legitimate functionality identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior typical of information-stealing malware, collecting sensitive user data from browsers, wallet applications, and system files, then exfiltrating via webhooks or uploads. The presence of obfuscation, hardcoded URLs, process termination, and extensive data collection functions confirms its malicious intent. It should be considered highly dangerous and should not be used or trusted.",
