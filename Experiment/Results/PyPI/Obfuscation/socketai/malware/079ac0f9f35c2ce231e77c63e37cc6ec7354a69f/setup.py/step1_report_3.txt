{
  "purpose": "This code appears to perform multiple malicious activities, including data exfiltration, credential theft, token harvesting, and system data collection, likely aimed at espionage or unauthorized access.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, local files, browser storage, and web requests. It extracts user credentials, cookies, local storage data, and tokens from various applications and browsers. It also reads input from URL requests and local files.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to external webhooks, posts data via HTTP requests, and uploads data using requests to transfer.sh. It also executes system commands and kills processes, potentially disrupting the system.",
  "flows": "Malicious data flows from data sources (e.g., environment variables, local files, browser databases) through decryption and processing routines, then exfiltrates via webhooks and HTTP POST requests. Threaded functions perform parallel collection of tokens, credentials, cookies, and system information, which are then uploaded or sent to attacker-controlled endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable names, dynamic imports with fallback installation, use of hardcoded Discord webhook URL, extensive threading for concurrent data collection, and multiple suspicious functions for stealing cookies, passwords, and tokens. The presence of functions for decrypting browser data and injecting/decrypting encrypted payloads indicates malicious intent. Additionally, it attempts to kill known browser processes and gather sensitive user data without consent.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step, the code begins by importing various modules and defining a webhook URL. It retrieves the external IP address. It then ensures necessary modules are installed. The code gathers system environment variables for typical application data paths. Several functions decrypt encrypted browser data, extract cookies, passwords, and tokens from browser profiles, and check for malicious tokens or credentials. It uses threading to perform parallel data collection from multiple sources including browsers, Steam, and other applications. It also collects local system information, including stored passwords and cookies. Collected data is then uploaded or sent via webhooks. The code includes obfuscation and hardcoded URLs, functions for process termination, and zipping of browser data. All these activities point to a comprehensive credential-stealing malware aimed at exfiltration of sensitive data, system information, and tokens for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior typical of stealer malware, with extensive data harvesting, decryption, and exfiltration mechanisms. It is designed to secretly collect user credentials, tokens, cookies, and system data, then transmit this information to external endpoints. Its obfuscation, use of threading, and active system process termination further confirm its malicious intent. Therefore, this package is highly dangerous and should not be used.",
