  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Code input, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec), environment variables, network calls, file operations, import statements.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writing, environment variable access, system calls, data leakage points.",
  "flows": "From code input or environment variables to network/file sinks, especially via eval/exec or hardcoded secrets.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic code execution (eval/exec), misleading variable names, hardcoded secrets, minimal comments, unusual module usage, lack of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify the presence or absence of code and suspicious patterns. Reports with no code or benign code are scored appropriately. Report 4 contains dynamic features and misleading patterns, warranting a higher malware score (from 0.2 to 0.4) and slightly increased confidence (from 0.6 to 0.7). The security risk score remains moderate (0.4) due to potential misuse. Other reports are consistent with their descriptions, with minimal or no suspicious activity. Adjustments improve alignment with observed patterns and potential risks.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the reports are accurate; minor score adjustments enhance precision. Report 4's increased malware score reflects its suspicious features, while other reports remain low risk. The assessments are consistent with code indications, with no confirmed malicious activity.",
