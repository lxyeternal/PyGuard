Encoded or encrypted data is decoded and executed, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, backdoor installation, or malicious payload deployment.\",\n  \"flows\": \"Code reads '__code__' string, decodes and executes it via 'exec' in 'dAmDcXFAAGySpSFTnVxTGrFCqxudZOpO'. The class methods also perform arbitrary calculations, manipulate global state, and execute dynamically imported modules, potentially loading malicious payloads. The flow from input (__code__) to 'exec' constitutes the primary malicious pathway.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"Heavy obfuscation with Unicode escape sequences, dynamic imports, and convoluted control flow. Use of lambda functions and string encodings (hex, base64) to hide malicious activity. Unusual variable names and cryptic function calls suggest malicious intent. Presence of encoded data that appears to be encrypted or compressed (e.g., 'b'x\\x9c\\xdd[ms...'). The code executes potentially malicious payloads from encoded data.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code is heavily obfuscated, utilizing string encodings, dynamic import, and exec functions to hide its true purpose. It constructs and executes code from encoded data, likely malicious payloads, without explicit disclosure. The class methods perform arithmetic operations and manipulate global state, potentially to control or trigger malicious behavior. Error handling reroutes execution to further obscure operations. The usage of encoded payloads, dynamic execution, and obfuscated control flow strongly indicates malicious intent, aiming to conceal payloads or backdoors that could compromise system security.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"This code is highly suspicious, exhibiting multiple signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and data encoding that are typical of malicious payloads or backdoors. Its purpose appears to be to execute hidden code, potentially malicious, without user knowledge. It should be considered malicious and unsafe to run.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.8,\n  \"malware\": 0.9,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.9\n}",
