{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for malicious activity, employing heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and external communication to conceal payloads or backdoors.",
  "sources": "Input from '__code__', encoded data strings, dynamic import statements, lambda functions, and external URLs (GitHub, Discord).",
  "sinks": "exec and eval functions executing decoded or encrypted payloads, dynamic import of modules, global state manipulation, and network URLs potentially used for command and control or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources include '__code__' and encoded strings; data is decoded and passed through dynamic import/eval/exec functions; external URLs are referenced; control flow involves complex, obfuscated function calls leading to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy use of unicode escapes, string encodings, cryptic variable names, dynamic import and execution via obfuscated strings, broad exception handling, and external URLs embedded in code, all indicating deliberate obfuscation and concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated with unicode escapes, dynamic import statements, and encoded payloads. It executes code via 'exec' and 'eval' on decoded data, manipulates global state, and references external URLs that could serve as command-and-control servers. The control flow is convoluted, designed to hide malicious intent. The presence of encoded data, dynamic code execution, and external communication strongly suggest malicious behavior, such as backdoors, payload loaders, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, exhibiting heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and external communication points. It should be classified as malicious with high confidence and avoided in any supply chain or production environment.",
