  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package including dependencies",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies from the 'install_requires' list",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; setup configuration does not execute untrusted code or data",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; dependencies are specified statically",
  "anomalies": "Variable 'kZwAGkMFGrBHmdRNGsriMOegTtGhZHvg' is defined but not used, which may indicate obfuscation or leftover code; no other suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, defines a version string in a variable with a nonsensical name, and calls setup() with package name and dependencies. There are no signs of malicious code such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated logic. The variable appears unused, which could be a code obfuscation tactic, but does not affect security or indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior. The unused variable might suggest obfuscation or leftovers but does not introduce security risks.",
