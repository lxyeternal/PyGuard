      "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated identifiers but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is likely intended to hide the purpose but does not constitute malicious activity. Scores are consistent across reports, with malware score at 0, obfuscation moderate, and security risk minimal."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, exhibiting heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and external communication points. It should be classified as malicious with high confidence and avoided in any supply chain or production environment."
