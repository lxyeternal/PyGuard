  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high likelihood of malicious behavior due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, which is a common tactic in malware delivery. The stealthy execution and error suppression further support this. While the exact payload is unknown, the indicators justify a high malware and security risk score."
