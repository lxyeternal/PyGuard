  "conclusion": "The code contains highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup, indicative of malicious intent. The use of encoded commands, hidden execution, and error suppression warrants high malware and risk scores. The behavior aligns with common supply chain attack techniques, and further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious actions. Overall, the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further analysis confirms safety."
