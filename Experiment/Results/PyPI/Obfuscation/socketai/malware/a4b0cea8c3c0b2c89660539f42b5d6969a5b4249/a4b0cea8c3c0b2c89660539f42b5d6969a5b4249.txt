      "conclusion": "The setup script contains suspicious obfuscated strings and malformed metadata but shows no evidence of active malicious behavior or payloads. The repeated obfuscated string warrants further decoding to rule out hidden payloads. The irregular package name and metadata anomalies suggest obfuscation or intentional concealment, but current static analysis indicates low risk of active malware. Caution is advised, and further dynamic or static decoding is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, including remote payload fetching, overwriting critical system and Python files, and executing external commands. The behavior is consistent across reports, and the scores are appropriate. The obfuscation level is moderate to high, and overall, the code poses a severe security threat."
