  "malware_score": 0.85,
  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, including remote payload fetching, overwriting critical system and Python files, and executing external commands. The behavior is consistent across reports, and the scores are appropriate. The obfuscation level is moderate to high, and overall, the code poses a severe security threat."
