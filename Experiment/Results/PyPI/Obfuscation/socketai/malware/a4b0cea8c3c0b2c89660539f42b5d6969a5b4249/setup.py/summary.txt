  "conclusion": "The setup script contains suspicious obfuscated strings and malformed metadata but shows no evidence of active malicious behavior or payloads. The repeated obfuscated string warrants further decoding to rule out hidden payloads. The irregular package name and metadata anomalies suggest obfuscation or intentional concealment, but current static analysis indicates low risk of active malware. Caution is advised, and further dynamic or static decoding is recommended before deployment."
