  "purpose": "Analysis of the provided setup script and associated metadata for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on suspicious strings and malformed parameters.",
  "sources": "Static strings within the setup() parameters, especially the suspicious string 'rOisBqkklcVlAKSTMfJzcuoRaDLGepOI=' embedded in license and other fields.",
  "sinks": "Metadata fields such as 'license', 'authors', and 'keywords' where obfuscated or suspicious data is stored; no dynamic or runtime sinks detected.",
  "flows": "The suspicious string appears in metadata fields without any code execution or network activity; no flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations observed.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated presence of the obfuscated-looking string 'rOisBqkklcVlAKSTMfJzcuoRaDLGepOI=' in setup parameters, malformed setup() call with inconsistent parameters, suspicious package name, and typos in metadata ('ascci').",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup script with malformed parameters and embedded obfuscated strings. No active malicious code, network activity, or dynamic behavior detected. The suspicious string likely represents obfuscated data or a placeholder, but without decoding, its purpose remains uncertain. Metadata irregularities suggest possible obfuscation or sabotage, but no direct evidence of malicious payloads or exploits. The overall structure indicates potential obfuscation rather than active malware.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains suspicious obfuscated strings and malformed metadata but shows no evidence of active malicious behavior or payloads. The repeated obfuscated string warrants further decoding to rule out hidden payloads. The irregular package name and metadata anomalies suggest obfuscation or intentional concealment, but current static analysis indicates low risk of active malware. Caution is advised, and further dynamic or static decoding is recommended before deployment.",
