      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, covert execution of a PowerShell command during setup. The behavior aligns with tactics used in malware delivery or system sabotage. The current scores are justified; further analysis should decode the payload for definitive confirmation."
