  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious, potentially malicious behavior through obfuscated, hidden execution of a PowerShell command during setup. The current scores are justified given the evidence, but decoding the command is recommended to confirm malicious intent. Pending decoding, the package should be treated as high risk."
