{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with an additional attempt to run a hidden PowerShell command if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "The script reads the filesystem to check for 'tahg' directory; potentially reads environment variables if any are used elsewhere; executes a subprocess command.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess invocation that executes PowerShell commands; filesystem check that may trigger command execution.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the script executes the PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen, which could potentially run malicious code hidden within the encoded command.",
  "anomalies": "The encoded PowerShell command is suspicious, as it is encoded and executed silently with hidden window style. The specific command is Base64 encoded, which is common in obfuscated or malicious scripts. No clear purpose for this command is visible, indicating possible obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'distutils.core.setup' for package setup. It then tries to import 'subprocess' and 'os' modules. If the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it attempts to run an encoded PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with hidden window style, which is often used to conceal malicious activity. The encoding of the PowerShell command suggests obfuscation. The setup function declares package metadata but does not contain suspicious code itself. The overall structure indicates the primary concern is the hidden PowerShell execution, which could be malicious, especially given the encoded command and silent execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a potentially malicious hidden PowerShell execution triggered under a specific filesystem condition. The encoded command and silent execution are suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes, such as downloading or executing additional payloads. Further analysis of the decoded PowerShell command is recommended to confirm intent.",
