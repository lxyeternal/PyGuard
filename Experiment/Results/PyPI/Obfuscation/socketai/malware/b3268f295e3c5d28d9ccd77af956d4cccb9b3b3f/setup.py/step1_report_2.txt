  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package, but also executes a hidden PowerShell command potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment (os.path.exists), executes subprocess.Popen with a PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executes an encoded PowerShell command that may run arbitrary code without user awareness.",
  "flows": "os.path.exists check triggers subprocess.Popen with encoded PowerShell command, possibly executing malicious payload.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hidden window style, encoded command string in subprocess call, minimal error handling, and attempt to run potentially malicious code during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'distutils.core' for setup, then attempts to check for existence of 'tahg' directory. If it doesn't exist, it runs a subprocess with a PowerShell command encoded in base64, which is hidden from the user interface. The PowerShell command appears to be obfuscated, which is suspicious. The setup call includes package metadata. The presence of encoded command execution during setup is suspicious and typical of malicious activity attempting to run hidden payloads during installation. Error handling is broad, swallowing all exceptions, which obscures failures and may hide malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The primary concern is the encoded command execution, which could perform malicious actions on the host system. The rest of the setup appears legitimate, but the payload execution is suspicious and potentially harmful.",
