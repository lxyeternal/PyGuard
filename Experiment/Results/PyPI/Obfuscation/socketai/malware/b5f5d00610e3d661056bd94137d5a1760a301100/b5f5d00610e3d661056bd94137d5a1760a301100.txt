      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior, including obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup, triggered conditionally. The use of encoding, silent execution, and error suppression aligns with common malicious tactics. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified by these indicators, warranting caution and further analysis of the payload."
