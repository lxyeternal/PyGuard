  "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious activity, including encrypted payload fetching, obfuscation, dynamic execution, and directory scanning. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.8–0.9, security risk: 0.8–0.9, obfuscation: 0.8–0.9) are justified and consistent with its behavior. It should be considered highly malicious and dangerous for deployment or inclusion in any environment."
