      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, executing an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The behavior aligns with tactics used in supply chain malware or covert payload delivery. The scores are appropriate, though slightly increasing the malware and risk scores to 0.85 and 0.9 respectively would better reflect the high confidence in malicious intent."
