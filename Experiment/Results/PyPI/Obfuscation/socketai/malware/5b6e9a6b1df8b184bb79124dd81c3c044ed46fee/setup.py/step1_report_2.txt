  "flows": "Collects hostname, current directory, username -> sends data via HTTP GET request to a remote server",
  "anomalies": "Data collection during installation, data sent to an external server without user consent, potential for tracking",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during package installation, collects hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information to a remote server ('http://5r13v9.ceye.io') via an HTTP GET request. This behavior resembles user tracking or data exfiltration. The code uses standard libraries but leverages them maliciously to surveil the user system during install. No hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads are present; however, the silent data transmission during setup indicates potentially malicious or at least privacy-intrusive behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent by collecting system data during package installation and transmitting it to a remote server without explicit user consent, indicating a tracking or surveillance activity.",
