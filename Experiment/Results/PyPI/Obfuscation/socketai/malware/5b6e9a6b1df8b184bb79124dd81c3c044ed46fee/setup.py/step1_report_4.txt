  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports (requests, socket, getpass, os); socket.gethostname(); os.getcwd(); getpass.getuser(); requests.get() call with constructed URL and parameters.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to external server ('http://5r13v9.ceye.io') with collected system info as parameters.",
  "flows": "During installation, gather hostname, current directory, and username; send this data via HTTP GET request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code gathers system information and transmits it to an external domain without user consent or clear purpose. The domain 'ceye.io' is known for security testing and C2 communications. The code is embedded within a setup script, which is unusual for benign behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon execution, collects hostname, current working directory, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to an external server with this info as parameters. This behavior occurs during package installation, which is unexpected for a standard setup process. The external request may be used for tracking, reconnaissance, or malicious command and control communication. There are no hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads, but the data exfiltration is suspicious. The code does not perform malicious actions beyond data transmission, but the intent to send system info without user knowledge is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The script secretly collects system info during package installation and transmits it to an external server, indicating potentially malicious or at least privacy-invasive behavior. The code appears designed for tracking or reconnaissance rather than legitimate setup purposes.",
