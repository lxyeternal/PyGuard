{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package, which gathers system information and sends it to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() — these functions collect hostname, current working directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() — sends collected system data to an external URL (http://5r13v9.ceye.io).",
  "flows": "System info is collected via source functions and then sent via requests.get() to an external server during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure class and method names, unusual data collection during install, and data exfiltration to an external domain without user consent. The code does not perform any benign function related to package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the setup process by subclassing the install command, adding a step that collects system information (hostname, working directory, username), and then makes an HTTP GET request to an external server with this data. This behavior is hidden within the custom install process and occurs automatically upon installation. The external URL is suspicious, and data exfiltration during package install is considered malicious behavior. The code does not validate the data or provide any indication of user notification or consent. The rest of the setup code appears normal, but the malicious data collection and transmission constitute a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it secretly collects system information and exfiltrates it to an external server during package installation. This indicates potentially malicious intent aimed at user data collection without consent.",
