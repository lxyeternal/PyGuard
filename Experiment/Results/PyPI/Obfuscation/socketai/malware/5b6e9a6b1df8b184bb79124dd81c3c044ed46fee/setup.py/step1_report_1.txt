{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup installation process that gathers system information and sends it to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() – reading system hostname, current directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() – sending data to an external server via HTTP GET request.",
  "flows": "System information (hostname, cwd, username) is collected as parameters and sent to 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during installation without user consent, and the target URL appears suspicious (ceye.io is known for DNS/TCP testing). The code obscures method and class names, which could be an attempt to evade detection. No other malicious actions or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from 'install' that overrides the installation method. During installation, it gathers system info (hostname, current directory, username) and immediately sends this data to an external server via a GET request. The purpose appears to be collecting environment details during setup, possibly for tracking or reconnaissance. There are no hardcoded credentials, code injection, or malicious payloads beyond the data exfiltration. The use of external requests during setup can be suspicious, especially with an obscure URL, but no direct malicious activity such as damaging files or reverse shells is present.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains a potentially malicious behavior—exfiltrating system information during installation without user knowledge. While it does not contain active malware like file damage or remote access tools, the data collection itself raises security concerns. The suspicious URL and obfuscated method names suggest an intent to hide tracking activities. It warrants caution before use.",
