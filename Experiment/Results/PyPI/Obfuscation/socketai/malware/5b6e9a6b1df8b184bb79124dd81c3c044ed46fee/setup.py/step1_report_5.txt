  "purpose": "Define a custom setup install class that collects system information and sends it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() - gathering system info; requests.get() - sending data to remote server",
  "sinks": "requests.get() - transmits data over the network to an external server",
  "flows": "System info sources -> data collection -> data sent via requests.get() to remote server",
  "anomalies": "The code collects hostname, current working directory, and username without user consent and sends it to an external URL during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command class that, during installation, gathers system information including hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This behavior is suspicious because it leaks user environment data to an external domain without user awareness or consent. The data collection occurs during the setup process, which is an unusual and potentially malicious activity designed for tracking or data exfiltration. No other malicious activities such as code injection, data theft beyond environment info, or backdoors are evident. The code's purpose appears to be covert data collection, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly collects user and system environment information during installation and transmits it to an external server. This behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, indicating possible data exfiltration without user consent.",
