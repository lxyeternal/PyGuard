{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during package setup, collects system information (hostname, current directory, username) and transmits it to a remote server via an HTTP GET request, indicating covert data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() during setup execution",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' with system info as parameters",
  "flows": "Data is collected from system info sources and sent via requests.get() to the external URL during the installation process",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names, data exfiltration during setup without user consent, transmission to a suspicious URL (ceye.io), no user notification or consent, absence of other malicious payloads",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert collection of system information and transmits it to an external server during package installation, indicating malicious intent. The obfuscation of class and method names suggests an attempt to evade detection. The external URL is suspicious and commonly associated with testing or command-and-control activities. No active malware payloads are present, but the behavior aligns with spyware or backdoor activity. The data exfiltration during setup without user knowledge constitutes a privacy violation and security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during installation, justified by high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. It should be flagged for further review or removal due to privacy invasion and potential for malicious tracking.",
