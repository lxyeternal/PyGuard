      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, employing obfuscation, stealth, and conditional execution of encoded PowerShell commands, characteristic of malicious activity. The high scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. Further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent, but current evidence indicates a significant security threat."
