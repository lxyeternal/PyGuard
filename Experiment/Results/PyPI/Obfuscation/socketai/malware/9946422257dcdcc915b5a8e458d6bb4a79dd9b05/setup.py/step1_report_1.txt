{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with additional behavior to execute a hidden PowerShell command.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the existence check for 'tahg' directory and the embedded PowerShell command string within subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen, which potentially can perform malicious actions based on the encoded command string.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory; if not present, it executes the encoded PowerShell command. This can happen automatically during setup, possibly without user consent.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a base64-encoded PowerShell command that is executed in a hidden window; lack of transparency and control. The command is encoded, making it difficult to analyze its intent. The code catches all exceptions silently, hiding errors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions, then attempts to execute a PowerShell command if the 'tahg' directory does not exist. The command is encoded, likely to obfuscate its purpose. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags suggests an intent to run silently. The setup call is straightforward, defining package metadata. The silent exception handling prevents visibility into errors, which is suspicious. Overall, the script may be trying to perform malicious actions during the package setup process, such as establishing a reverse shell or executing malicious code, concealed within the encoded command.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains potentially malicious behavior due to the hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell command during setup, which could perform malicious actions without user awareness. The silent exception handling further obscures activity. The setup function itself appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the suspicious code execution.",
