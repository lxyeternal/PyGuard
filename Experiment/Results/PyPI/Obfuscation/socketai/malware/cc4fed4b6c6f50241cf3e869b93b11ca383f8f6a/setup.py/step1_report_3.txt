  "purpose": "Set up a Python package and execute a hidden PowerShell command if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('tahg') check, subprocess.Popen call with encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command, potential writing or execution of malicious payload.",
  "flows": "Code checks for 'tahg' directory -> If absent, executes hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command embedded directly in Python code, suppressed exceptions, no validation of command content.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to run a PowerShell command in a hidden window if the directory 'tahg' does not exist. The command is encoded in Base64, which is suspicious and typical for obfuscation. The use of subprocess.Popen with creation flags to hide the window indicates an attempt to conceal activity. The setup function defines package metadata with no issues. The code suppresses exceptions broadly, which may hide errors or malicious activity. The encoded command may perform malicious actions, such as downloading or executing external scripts, although the exact payload cannot be decoded directly here. The use of such obfuscation and silent execution strongly suggests malicious intent or an attempt to execute hidden code.",
  "conclusion": "The script includes obfuscated PowerShell code executed silently, which is highly suspicious. The code’s intent appears to be to execute potentially malicious PowerShell commands without user awareness, indicating likely malicious behavior.",
