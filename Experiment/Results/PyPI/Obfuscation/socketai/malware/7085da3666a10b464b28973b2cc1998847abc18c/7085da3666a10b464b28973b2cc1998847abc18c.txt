      "obfuscated": 0.9,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign-looking setup script employing obfuscation techniques, likely to conceal dependencies or intent. While no active malicious behavior is detected, the obfuscation and misuse of setup parameters raise suspicion. The high obfuscation and potential for hidden malicious dependencies justify further investigation, especially before deployment or inclusion in supply chains."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears benign in isolation but relies on an external 'setup' module that could be malicious if compromised. The obfuscation and import pattern warrant caution, but no direct malicious activity is evident. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Vigilance and further review of the 'setup' module are advised."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, demonstrating remote code execution, hiding techniques, and obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.9, obfuscated: 0.8, security risk: 0.9) are justified and consistent with observed behaviors."
