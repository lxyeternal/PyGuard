  "sinks": [],
  "flows": [],
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import (.setup), which could be standard, but may also obscure the source of imported code; variables with obfuscated names assigned straightforward string values.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local setup module, which is typical in package initialization. It then assigns three variables with seemingly innocuous string values: a version string and two project identifiers. The variable names are non-descriptive and appear obfuscated, possibly to conceal intent. There is no evidence of code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior within this fragment. The import statement could potentially import malicious or maliciously altered code if the setup module itself is compromised, but based solely on this code, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform a standard import and variable assignment with obfuscated variable names. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code within this fragment itself. The main concern would be the integrity of the imported setup module, which cannot be assessed here.",
