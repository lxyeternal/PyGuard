  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local setup module and define some version and project name variables.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .setup, variable assignments for version and project info.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from sources to sinks; variables are static strings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a relative import with wildcard (*) which could be risky if setup contains malicious code; variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, possibly indicating obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local setup module, which could potentially include malicious code if the module is compromised. The variables defined are static strings indicating version and project names. The variable names are non-descriptive and appear obfuscated, raising suspicion. There are no explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable manipulations. The code is minimal and appears to be part of a larger codebase. The import statement is a common target for supply chain attacks if the setup module is malicious. Overall, the code itself is not malicious but the pattern (wildcard import and obfuscated variable names) warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code's simplicity and use of wildcard import from a local module could pose security risks if the setup module is malicious. The variable definitions do not exhibit malicious behavior but their obfuscated names suggest the possibility of hidden intent. Overall, no direct malicious actions are observed in this fragment, but caution is advised due to import patterns.",
