{
  "purpose": "Minimal code importing from a local 'setup' module and defining version/identifier variables with obfuscated names.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .setup, static variable assignments",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; potential risk if 'setup' module is malicious",
  "flows": "Import from .setup potentially executes code; variables assigned statically",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import from 'setup', obfuscated variable names, absence of external input or output",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import from a local 'setup' module, which could contain malicious code if compromised. The variable names are obfuscated, possibly to conceal intent. No external data, network activity, or direct malicious actions are visible. The import pattern and obfuscated variables are suspicious but not definitive of malicious behavior. The malware score is low (0.2), reflecting the lack of direct malicious activity but acknowledging the potential risk from the import source. The obfuscation score is high (0.7), consistent with the variable naming. The overall security risk score is moderate (0.3), mainly due to reliance on an external module that could be compromised. Further investigation into the 'setup' module is recommended to ensure supply chain integrity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in isolation but relies on an external 'setup' module that could be malicious if compromised. The obfuscation and import pattern warrant caution, but no direct malicious activity is evident. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Vigilance and further review of the 'setup' module are advised.",
