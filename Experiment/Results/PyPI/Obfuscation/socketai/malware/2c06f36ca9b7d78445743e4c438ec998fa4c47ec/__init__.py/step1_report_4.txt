{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function that prints a message indicating an installation or confirmation message and then calls that function.",
  "sources": "The function definition and its invocation; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output; no untrusted data or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Function is defined (source) and immediately invoked (sink), but no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears as a randomly generated string; no actual malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident beyond the naming choice. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single function with a seemingly random name, which simply prints a static message and is invoked immediately. There are no external data sources, no suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code constructs. The pattern suggests no malicious intent; the code's purpose is likely benign or a placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual function name appears to be obfuscation but does not impact security.",
