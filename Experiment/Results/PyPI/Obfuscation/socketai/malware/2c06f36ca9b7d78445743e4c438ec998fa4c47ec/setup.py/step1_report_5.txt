{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup script for a Python package with added functionality during installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URLs for fetching external content and executing downloaded files.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, writing files, executing downloaded files via os.system.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is used to generate a URL request, then if on Windows, a file is downloaded and executed.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual obfuscation in function and class names, dynamic URL generation based on environment variables, fetching and executing remote scripts during installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to an external URL. On Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it immediately. This behavior occurs during the package installation process, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The obfuscated naming and remote code execution strongly suggest malicious intent or a backdoor. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks and actively contacts external servers to download and run code, which is typical of supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates malicious behavior by fetching and executing remote payloads during installation, likely intended to compromise systems. The obfuscated code, external communications, and remote execution indicate a high malicious intent score.",
