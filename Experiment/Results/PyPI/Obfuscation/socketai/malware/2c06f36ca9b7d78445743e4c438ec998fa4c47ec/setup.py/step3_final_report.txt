{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate system information, download a malicious payload, and execute it silently during package installation, primarily on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs; downloads a payload from a suspicious URL.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external domains; writing and executing a downloaded executable via os.system; silent execution during setup.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> HTTP request to exfiltrate data -> download of payload -> execution of payload via os.system during install.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; broad exception handling suppressing errors; execution of external payload during package installation; use of suspicious URLs; silent payload execution on Windows.",
  "analysis": "The code reads an environment variable, communicates with external servers, downloads a payload, and executes it silently during installation, indicating malicious intent. Obfuscation and error suppression further conceal malicious behavior. The URLs used are suspicious and unrelated to legitimate package sources. The malicious actions pose a high security risk, including potential system compromise and data exfiltration. The behavior is consistent with supply chain sabotage, and the code's structure facilitates stealthy malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including remote data exfiltration, silent payload download and execution, obfuscation, and execution during package installation. It poses a severe security threat and should be classified with maximum malware and risk scores.",
