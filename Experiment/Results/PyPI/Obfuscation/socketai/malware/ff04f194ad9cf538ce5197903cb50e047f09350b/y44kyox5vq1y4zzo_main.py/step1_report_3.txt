  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves code -> base64 decode -> exec() executes code",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding combined with dynamic execution of remote fetched code; silent exception handling; the function is run in a separate thread but the thread is not started properly.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that retrieves a remote script via HTTP GET request, decodes it from base64, and executes it. The function is intended to run in a thread, but the thread is created without being started (missing .start()), so it does not execute unless called explicitly. The use of exec() on remote fetched data is highly suspicious as it allows arbitrary code execution, which can be malicious. The exception handling suppresses errors silently, which can hide malicious activity or errors during fetch and execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to dynamically fetch and execute external code, which is a common technique in malicious scripts to run payloads or obfuscate intent. The silent failure and the remote code execution pose significant security risks. Given these factors, the code exhibits a high likelihood of malicious behavior.",
