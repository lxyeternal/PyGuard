  "conclusion": "This code exhibits a high-risk pattern of remote code execution with obfuscation, typical of malicious loaders or backdoors. Despite not executing immediately due to the thread not being started, the pattern warrants a high malware score and security alert. It should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious, especially in supply chain contexts."
