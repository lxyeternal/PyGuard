{
  "purpose": "Fetches remote code from a URL, decodes it from base64, and executes it dynamically within a thread (which is not started).",
  "sources": "requests.get() fetching external URL; base64 decoding the response content.",
  "sinks": "exec() executing the decoded code, which can run arbitrary code with full system access.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves data -> base64 decoding -> exec() executes code; the thread targets the function but is not started.",
  "anomalies": "Function name is obfuscated; thread is created but not started; minimal error handling; remote URL is external and uncontrolled.",
  "analysis": "The code pattern involves remote code fetching, decoding, and execution, which is a common malicious tactic. The thread creation without starting suggests incomplete implementation or obfuscation. The use of exec() on fetched data poses high security risks. The silent exception handling hides errors, potentially masking malicious activity. The pattern indicates high suspicion of malicious intent, especially if invoked elsewhere. The obfuscated function name adds to the suspicion. The code as-is does not execute the payload unless called, but the pattern itself is dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits a high-risk pattern of remote code execution with obfuscation, typical of malicious loaders or backdoors. Despite not executing immediately due to the thread not being started, the pattern warrants a high malware score and security alert. It should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious, especially in supply chain contexts.",
