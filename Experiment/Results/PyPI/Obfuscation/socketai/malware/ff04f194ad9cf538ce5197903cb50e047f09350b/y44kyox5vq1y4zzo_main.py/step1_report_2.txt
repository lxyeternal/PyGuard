  "purpose": "The code appears to dynamically fetch and execute external code from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "requests.get() fetches data from 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmnstnd/http3_client/main/cdn'.",
  "sinks": "exec() executes the decoded code fetched from the URL, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves code -> base64.b64decode() decodes it -> exec() runs the decoded code.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is obfuscated; the code fetches and executes external code without verification, and the threading.Thread() is initiated but not started, which might be an oversight or attempt to hide behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that retrieves code from a remote URL and executes it after base64 decoding. It includes exception handling for KeyboardInterrupt, allowing early exit. The threading.Thread() is created with the target function but is not started (missing .start()), so the thread does not run as intended. The external code fetched could contain malicious payloads, leading to arbitrary system compromise. The obfuscated function name and the lack of validation or sandboxing increase suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its dynamic code fetching and execution, obfuscated naming, and incomplete threading implementation. It likely attempts to run remote code without verification, which is a significant security risk.",
