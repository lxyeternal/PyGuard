  "purpose": "The code appears to gather system information and send it to a remote server over a socket connection.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd(), pwd.getpwuid(), socket.gethostname(), environment variables",
  "sinks": "socket connection (sending data over network), base64 decoding and network transmission",
  "flows": "system info gathered via os and pwd → obfuscated string constructed → base64 decoded hostname → socket connects to decoded hostname and port → data sent",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated string construction, base64 encoding/decoding, repeated code blocks, network connection with encoded host and port, no clear legitimate purpose, no input validation, exception handling with empty blocks",
  "analysis": "The script collects system-specific data such as current directory, username, hostname, then constructs an obfuscated message by XOR-ing characters. It base64-encodes this data and prepares an HTTP-like GET request. The code then decodes a base64-encoded hostname and connects to a hardcoded port, sending the obfuscated info. The identical block is duplicated, indicating possible obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious activity. The network activity to an encoded hostname and port, combined with obfuscated string manipulation, suggests potential data exfiltration or backdoor communication. No legitimate or benign use of this pattern is evident, and the code lacks input validation or logging.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates obfuscated network activity that could be used for malicious data exfiltration or establishing covert command-and-control channels. Its intent is suspicious due to obfuscation, network connections to encoded hosts, and duplicated blocks. While no explicit malicious payload (like malware installation or data theft) is observed, the pattern of behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
