{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect system information (current directory, username, hostname) and send it over a network connection, possibly as part of a data exfiltration or reconnaissance attempt.",
  "sources": "Reading current working directory, obtaining username via pwd, hostname via socket, and possibly reading environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Network socket connection to a potentially malicious server, sending encoded data.",
  "flows": "Collect system info (source) → Encode information → Establish socket connection → Send encoded info (sink) → Close connection",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, repeated code blocks, use of XOR cipher on data, decoding and connecting to an external IP, use of base64-encoded strings for server address, hardcoded connection port. The code repeats identical blocks twice with no clear reason.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system modules and retrieves system info (current directory, username, hostname). It then constructs an encoded message containing this info, using XOR encryption with a fixed key, indicating an attempt to obfuscate data. The message is formatted as an HTTP GET request with base64-encoded data. The script establishes a socket connection to a decoded IP address and port, then transmits the encoded data, likely to a remote server. The code appears intentionally obfuscated via variable names and encoding, repeating the same operations twice without any legitimate purpose in the context of a package. The purpose is consistent with data exfiltration or reconnaissance, which is suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to obfuscation, data collection, encoding, and network transmission to an external IP address. It appears to be designed for malicious activity such as data exfiltration or reconnaissance, fitting criteria for malware. The repeated code blocks suggest an attempt to hide intent or redundancy, but overall the behavior is malicious.",
