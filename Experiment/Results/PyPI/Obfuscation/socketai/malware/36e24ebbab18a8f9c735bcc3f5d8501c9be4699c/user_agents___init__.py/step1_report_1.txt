  "purpose": "Assign a tuple to a variable and import a module from the current package.",
  "sources": "Assignment statement; import statement from relative module",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or sensitive data exposure",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the import is static and the assignment is straightforward",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name (CAgAwebrvTvJbHUVaoAiaUwujHjWRaLu); the variable name appears randomly generated or obfuscated; the imported module name 'jMvZNehmajTTSQbCWGwvaSlDuWQwpuSd' is also obfuscated and not descriptive",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a tuple to a variable with an obfuscated name, and imports a module using a non-descriptive, seemingly randomly generated name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code. The obfuscation could suggest an attempt to hide intent, but could also be a result of code obfuscation or generated code. No other suspicious activity or data flow is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, with obfuscated identifiers, but contains no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation might be intended to hide functionality but does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
