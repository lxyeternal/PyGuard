  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for a Python package named 'phs885t88hul47v8'.",
  "sources": "Imports 'setuptools' for packaging; the rest are static string and list literals within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic input or untrusted data sources; no external data handling or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a base64-like string ('XrDRDYVnfuZAlXpCkozgnsRUjsuDmMHa=') assigned to a key that resembles a parameter name, but used as a static string. The key itself appears obfuscated or nonsensical, with no clear purpose or explanation. The key 'iCRiHLoCqGCbcABLabnMclzycygHaYzJ' appears to be a random string, not a standard parameter name. These unusual keys and values are suspicious and may indicate obfuscation or hidden data.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setuptools setup script with standard package metadata. The only unusual elements are the key-value pairs with non-descriptive, seemingly random keys and values, such as 'XrDRDYVnfuZAlXpCkozgnsRUjsuDmMHa=' and 'iCRiHLoCqGCbcABLabnMclzycygHaYzJ'. These do not align with standard setup parameters and could be attempts at obfuscation or embedding hidden data. No dynamic code, user input, or external data sources are present. The suspicious keys and values merit closer inspection, but as-is, they do not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with some obfuscated-looking key-value pairs that are unusual but not inherently malicious. There are no active malicious behaviors, network activities, or security vulnerabilities present. The anomalies suggest possible obfuscation or hidden data, but no malicious intent can be definitively concluded from this fragment alone.",
