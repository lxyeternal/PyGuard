  "purpose": "Analyze the provided setup script for signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Variables 'XrDRDYVnfuZAlXpCkozgnsRUjsuDmMHa=' assigned 'text/markdown'; variable 'iCRiHLoCqGCbcABLabnMclzycygHaYzJ' assigned to a dependency list; both are unused elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "No active sinks such as network calls, file operations, or code execution; focus on variable assignments and potential obfuscated data.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated variables assigned at the top of the script, potentially intended to hide malicious payloads or data; no further data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of nonsensical variable names, unused variables, invalid parameter assignments (e.g., base64 string assigned to 'license'), and potential syntax irregularities.",
  "analysis": "The code contains obfuscated variable names with nonsensical strings, assigned to parameters like 'license' and other fields, which are not used elsewhere. These anomalies suggest obfuscation or hidden data. The syntax appears malformed in places, such as assigning a list outside a proper parameter context, indicating possible intentional obfuscation or corruption. No active malicious code, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present. The obfuscation and malformed syntax increase suspicion but do not confirm malicious payloads. The scores reflect high obfuscation (around 0.7), moderate malware potential (around 0.4), and elevated risk (around 0.6), especially considering the possibility of hidden malicious intent within obfuscated data or syntax anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and potential malicious intent, notably through nonsensical variable names, unused assignments, and syntax irregularities. While no direct malicious actions are visible, these anomalies warrant further investigation. The overall security risk is moderate to high, and the package should be reviewed thoroughly before use.",
