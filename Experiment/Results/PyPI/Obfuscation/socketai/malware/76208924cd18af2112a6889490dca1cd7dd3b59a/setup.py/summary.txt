  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during setup, strongly indicating malicious intent. The high obfuscation, stealthy execution, and error suppression justify classifying this as malicious activity. The package should be treated as potentially malicious and further analyzed by decoding the PowerShell command for confirmation."
