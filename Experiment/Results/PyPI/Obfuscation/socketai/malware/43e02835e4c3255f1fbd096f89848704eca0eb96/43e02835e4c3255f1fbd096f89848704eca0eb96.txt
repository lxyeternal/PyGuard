      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell payload during setup. The technique used is typical of malware or supply chain attacks. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriate and justified. This package should be flagged for further analysis or avoided until the payload can be decoded and verified."
