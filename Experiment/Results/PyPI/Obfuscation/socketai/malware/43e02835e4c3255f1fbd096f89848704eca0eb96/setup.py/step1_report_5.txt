  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that attempts to run a hidden PowerShell command and then defines package metadata.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('tahg') check, subprocess.Popen execution, setup() function call",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen command execution with encoded PowerShell command",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' directory -> If not exists, run encoded PowerShell command in background -> Define package setup metadata",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command executed in hidden window, no error handling for subprocess execution, obfuscated command content, no clear reason for the PowerShell payload, use of generic exception handling which suppresses errors",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing setup from distutils.core, then checks if a directory 'tahg' exists. If it does not, it attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64 via subprocess.Popen. The command is executed asynchronously and without waiting for completion, and the window is hidden. The purpose appears suspicious due to the obfuscated encoded command, which may be intended to run malicious payloads without user awareness. The setup() call appears benign but is placed after the potentially malicious command. Exception handling is broad and suppresses errors, reducing visibility into execution issues. The overall behavior resembles a supply chain attack vector or malware that tries to run hidden code during package setup, possibly for persistence or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains suspicious behavior with the execution of an encoded PowerShell command in a hidden window, likely malicious or harmful. The use of obfuscated code, silent error handling, and execution during package setup raises high concern for malicious intent or security risk.",
