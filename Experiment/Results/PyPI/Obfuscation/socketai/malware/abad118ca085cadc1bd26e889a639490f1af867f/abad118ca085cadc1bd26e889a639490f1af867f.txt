      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated, and stealthily executed PowerShell command, indicative of malicious intent. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and conditional trigger suggest malware activity. The scores are appropriate, and further decoding of the payload is recommended before deployment or distribution."
