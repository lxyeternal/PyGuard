  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security reports for Python dependencies, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code sections where data is read, such as input(), environment variables, or network requests.",
  "sinks": "Code points where untrusted data could cause data leaks, code execution, or system compromise, such as eval(), exec(), or network transmissions.",
  "flows": "Paths from sources to sinks, especially where untrusted input influences critical operations like eval() or database queries.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, excessive obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code is empty or benign in most reports, with Report 2 showing obfuscation and eval() usage. The scores assigned—malware=0.3 (adjusted to 0.4), obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.6—are consistent with the presence of obfuscation and dynamic features but lack confirmed malicious payloads. Other reports correctly indicate low risk and no malware. The overall assessment aligns with the evidence, with a slight increase in malware suspicion for Report 2 justified by the obfuscation and eval().",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign; Report 2 exhibits features warranting moderate suspicion, reflected in adjusted scores. The scoring is appropriate and consistent with the analysis, with a minor increase in malware score for Report 2 to better represent its suspicious features.",
