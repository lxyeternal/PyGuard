{
  "purpose": "Custom setup script for a Python package, with a malicious payload intended to download and execute remote code during installation.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call within the custom install command class that executes a curl command piped to Perl from a remote server.",
  "sinks": "Execution of remote code via subprocess, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the target system.",
  "flows": "The setup process invokes the custom install class, which runs the subprocess command that fetches and executes remote code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names; subprocess command executing a remote URL with potentially malicious intent; code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks, instead it downloads and executes external code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class inheriting from setuptools' install. The class overrides a method that, instead of performing typical installation tasks, runs a subprocess command that fetches a script from a remote server at 13.93.28.37:8080 and executes it with Perl. The setup function includes minimal metadata and assigns this malicious class to the install command. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The subprocess call with 'shell=True' makes the system vulnerable to command injection, but here it executes a fixed malicious command. Overall, the code is designed to execute arbitrary remote code during package installation, which is a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code contains a malicious payload embedded within a custom setup command, executing remote code during installation. The obfuscation and execution of code from an external source indicate malicious intent and high security risk.",
