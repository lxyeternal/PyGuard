      "conclusion": "The core setup code is benign; the anomalous line is invalid and likely a typo or obfuscation. It does not indicate malicious behavior but should be corrected to ensure proper functionality. The overall security risk is low, with no evidence of malware. The anomaly warrants correction but does not pose a security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to obfuscation and concealed data, indicating potential malicious payloads. While no direct malicious activity is evident, the pattern warrants caution and further analysis. The malware score should be increased to reflect the high suspicion, and the overall security risk is elevated."
