  "purpose": "Static package setup configuration with anomalous attribute and obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sources": "Package metadata, dependencies, and unusual attribute 'elxFTNAFJYXeuNSyHLuTTRxLEeLYpKml' assigned to 'text/markdown'.",
  "sinks": "None; no dynamic input, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a non-standard, nonsensical attribute 'elxFTNAFJYXeuNSyHLuTTRxLEeLYpKml' with value 'text/markdown'; obfuscated package name 'pyvpdvtlw5ewknql'; irregular parameter usage in setup().",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script with obfuscated identifiers and a suspicious, non-standard attribute. No dynamic or malicious code is present. The anomalies suggest obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious intent, but no active malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is evident. The malware score is low (0), consistent with the absence of malicious payloads. The obfuscation score is high (~0.8), reflecting suspicion due to nonsensical attribute and package name. The overall security risk is low (~0.3), primarily due to obfuscation, but further investigation is recommended if used in production environments.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains anomalous, obfuscated elements but no direct evidence of malware or malicious activity. The irregular attribute and package name suggest obfuscation, warranting caution and further review before deployment or distribution.",
