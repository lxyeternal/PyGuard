  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, designed for extensive data theft, credential harvesting, remote control, and system compromise. It employs heavy obfuscation, Windows-specific APIs, and multiple exfiltration methods. The high malware and risk scores are justified, and the obfuscation level is significant. This package represents a severe security threat and should be classified as high severity malware."
