{
  "purpose": "The code is a highly malicious Python malware payload acting as an info stealer and remote access trojan (RAT). It collects system information, passwords (Chrome, Firefox), cookies, Discord tokens, WiFi passwords, and establishes reverse shells for remote control. It exfiltrates data via webhooks and socket connections, and employs heavy obfuscation to evade detection.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, local system files (browser databases, WiFi passwords, credentials), network responses, user input from socket communication, local databases (Chrome, Firefox).",
  "sinks": "Network exfiltration via POST requests to webhooks, socket-based remote command execution, local file writes (logs, passwords, tokens), system commands (e.g., netsh), cryptography APIs for decrypting stored credentials.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from system/browser sources, decrypted/parsed, then transmitted over network (webhooks, sockets). Reverse shells allow remote command execution, with obfuscation hiding code intent. Data flows from local data sources through decryption routines to exfiltration channels.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code executed via exec() with a large string of '+' characters, nested classes/functions for data theft, use of Windows cryptography APIs, dynamic code execution, complex class structures for credential/token extraction, heavy use of local system files and network communication, suspicious large string concatenation for obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with an exec() call that constructs and executes code from a concatenated string of '+' characters, a common obfuscation technique. Multiple classes handle system info collection, password and cookie extraction, Discord token harvesting, WiFi password retrieval, and reverse shell management. The code interacts with Windows APIs for decrypting stored credentials, accesses browser databases, and communicates with external servers via HTTP POST requests and socket connections. The presence of functions for establishing reverse shells, extracting sensitive data, and obfuscation confirms malicious intent. The structure and activities align with known malware behaviors, including data theft, remote control, and evasion tactics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, designed for extensive data theft, credential harvesting, remote control, and system compromise. It employs heavy obfuscation, Windows-specific APIs, and multiple exfiltration methods. The high malware and risk scores are justified, and the obfuscation level is significant. This package represents a severe security threat and should be classified as high severity malware.",
