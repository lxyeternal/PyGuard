{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious information stealer and remote access trojan (RAT) designed to extract system information, cookies, Chrome passwords, Discord tokens, and potentially establish reverse shells or remote connections.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, system files (e.g., Chrome database files, cookies, Local State files), network responses (IP address, external IP via web requests), and user input from socket communications.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmissions (sending stolen data via webhooks), writing to local files (error logs, password logs, token files), executing system commands (e.g., netsh commands, remote shells), and decrypting stored passwords and cookies.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as Chrome/Firefox databases, system environment variables, and network responses, through decryption and processing functions, then exfiltrated via webhooks or sent over sockets. Tokens and passwords are gathered and then transmitted or saved locally.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated dynamic execution via exec with lengthy random strings, use of Windows cryptography functions for password decryption, and extensive use of hardcoded paths and external dependencies. It also defines multiple nested classes and functions for stealing WiFi passwords, Chrome passwords, cookies, and Discord tokens. The code has references to remote command execution and reverse shell functionality.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with obfuscated dynamic execution to conceal its purpose. It defines classes for collecting system information, WiFi passwords, Chrome passwords, cookies, and Discord tokens. It uses Windows-specific cryptography and SQLite to extract sensitive data. The presence of network communication functions (sending data to a webhook, establishing socket connections for reverse shells), along with functions for decrypting stored passwords and cookies, indicates intent to exfiltrate data and maintain remote access. The code also attempts to steal Discord tokens and verify their validity, typical for malicious credential theft. Overall, it combines multiple data collection and exfiltration techniques consistent with malware behavior. The code’s structure, obfuscation, and functions strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, combining information theft (passwords, cookies, tokens), potential remote control (reverse shells), and obfuscation techniques to conceal malicious activity. It exhibits typical RAT features, with extensive data exfiltration and system compromise mechanisms. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the package should not be used.",
