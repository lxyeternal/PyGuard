  "purpose": "Detects and executes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command during setup if directory 'tahg' does not exist.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory",
  "sinks": "Execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen",
  "flows": "Filesystem check -> subprocess.Popen with encoded command -> hidden window execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently; broad exception handling suppresses errors",
  "analysis": "The code performs a directory existence check; if absent, it runs a base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window flags, suppressing errors. The command's content is not revealed, but its obfuscation and stealth execution are suspicious. The setup() call is standard, but the embedded behavior suggests malicious or covert activity. The broad try-except blocks further conceal potential failures or malicious actions. The pattern aligns with common malware tactics such as covert payload delivery or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution during setup. The behavior pattern, obfuscation, and error suppression strongly indicate malicious or sabotage activity. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm intent.",
