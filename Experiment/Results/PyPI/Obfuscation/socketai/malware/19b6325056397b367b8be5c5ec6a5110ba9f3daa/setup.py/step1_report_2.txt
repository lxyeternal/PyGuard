{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with an additional attempt to execute a hidden PowerShell command if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existence of the directory 'tahg' and constructs a PowerShell command string to execute via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command, which could potentially be malicious depending on the content of the encoded command.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory → if not exists, executes the encoded PowerShell command → proceeds with setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded in Base64, which is often used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The subprocess call uses 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' with an encoded payload. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, preventing detection.",
  "analysis": "The script first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists. If not, it executes a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is hidden from standard output. The command is executed with 'WindowStyle Hidden' to avoid detection. The purpose of this command is unknown, but its obfuscation suggests malicious intent or covert activity. The setup function defines package metadata, which appears legitimate but is executed after the potentially malicious subprocess call. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, potentially hiding failures or malicious activity. Overall, the code's core malicious indicator is the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, which could be used to download, run, or perform malicious actions silently.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a suspicious obfuscated PowerShell command executed without transparency, which may perform malicious actions. The setup process itself is standard but overshadowed by the hidden command execution, raising concern about covert behavior.",
