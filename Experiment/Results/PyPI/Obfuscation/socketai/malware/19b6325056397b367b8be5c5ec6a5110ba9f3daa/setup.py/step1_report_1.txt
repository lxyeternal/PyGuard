  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess with hidden window; the encoded command is suspicious and indicates obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports distutils for setup purposes, which is normal for package setup. It then checks if a directory 'tahg' exists; if not, it executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a hidden window. The encoded command likely performs some actions without user visibility, raising suspicion. The code is wrapped in try-except blocks that suppress exceptions, preventing error alerts. The setup() function is standard but combined with the obfuscated PowerShell execution suggests potential malicious intent or sabotage, such as executing hidden scripts or payloads. The use of encoded commands and hidden window execution is characteristic of malicious or covert activities.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to perform a benign setup but includes suspicious behavior: executing a hidden, encoded PowerShell command when a specific directory does not exist. This behavior is typical of malicious activity, such as covertly running scripts or payloads. The code's intent cannot be definitively confirmed but raises security concerns due to obfuscation and hidden execution.",
