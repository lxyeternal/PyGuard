  "purpose": "Detects and executes a stealthy, obfuscated PowerShell command when the 'tahg' directory is absent, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command",
  "flows": "Filesystem check -> condition false -> subprocess runs encoded command silently",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command, execution with hidden window, broad try-except blocks suppressing errors",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the existence of 'tahg' directory; if missing, it runs a subprocess executing a base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window flags, suppressing errors. The setup call is also wrapped in broad exception handling. The encoded command's purpose is unknown but likely malicious due to obfuscation and stealth tactics. The code's behavior aligns with common malware delivery techniques, indicating high suspicion of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command triggered conditionally. The suspicious tactics, such as obfuscation, stealth execution, and error suppression, justify high malware and security risk scores. Further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent.",
