  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup configuration for a Python package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": [
    "Base64-encoded string decoded and executed via exec() and compile() functions, which could contain malicious code.",

    "Any imported modules or functions could be used maliciously if they contain malicious logic."

  "flows": [
    "Base64 string is decoded, compiled, and executed, creating a source-to-sink flow from the encoded payload to runtime execution.",
    "Imported modules and variables are set, but these are standard and do not involve untrusted data flow."

  "anomalies": [
    "Use of dynamic execution via exec() and compile() on a base64-encoded string, which is a common obfuscation technique.",
    "The code is heavily obfuscated at the start, decoding potentially malicious code hidden in the base64 string.",
    "Unusual variable names and obfuscated code structure."
  ],
  "analysis": "The initial part of the code imports necessary libraries, then immediately decodes a base64 string which is compiled and executed dynamically. This is a classic indicator of obfuscated malicious activity, as it hides the actual payload. The payload could contain malicious actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The rest of the code appears to be a standard setup script with package metadata, but this is likely a decoy or a remnant of the obfuscated payload. The reliance on dynamic code execution makes this code highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated code that is decoded and executed at runtime, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The obfuscation and use of exec() suggest an attempt to hide malicious payloads, making this package potentially dangerous. It should be treated as malicious until thoroughly analyzed and confirmed otherwise.",
