{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, primarily defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from base64-encoded string which is then executed as code; also reads from environment variables or external modules during setup.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decoded base64 string as code, which could potentially execute malicious code if manipulated.",
  "flows": "Base64 string is decoded and compiled, then executed, which may run arbitrary code. The setup() function manages package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of dynamic code execution via base64 decoding and execution. The variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, suggesting obfuscation or concealment. The base64 string, when decoded, imports 'tempfile' and 'webrequest', and appears to execute a request to an external URL, which could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools but then decodes a base64 string and executes it dynamically, bypassing normal static analysis. Decoded code imports 'tempfile' and 'webrequest', creates a temporary file, writes to it, and performs an HTTP GET request to an external URL ('https://pst.klgtrgh.io/paste/hzzzp/r') which may indicate malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or command and control communication. The presence of obfuscated variable names and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent or at least an attempt to conceal malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated code that executes a decoded payload, which contacts an external server, indicating potential malicious activity. The package could perform unauthorized data exfiltration or execute malicious commands. Overall, this code is suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
