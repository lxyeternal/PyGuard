      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its obfuscation, dynamic execution, and external network activity. It likely contains malicious payloads designed to evade static analysis. The high malware and risk scores are appropriate, and the package should be considered malicious until further static or dynamic analysis proves otherwise."

While terminal UI functions are present, the initial payload's decoding and execution are the primary concern. The scores are appropriate, but the malware score should be set to 1 for maximum caution."
