{
  "purpose": "The code establishes a reverse shell backdoor during package installation by connecting to a remote server, redirecting I/O, and spawning a shell.",
  "sources": "Retrieves system login, sends HTTP request with username, connects to hardcoded IP and port, and spawns a shell.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection, I/O redirection, and shell spawn during setup.",
  "flows": "During package install or develop, the code executes the function that connects to remote server, redirects I/O, and spawns a shell.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, hardcoded IP address, reverse shell activity, and spawning a shell during install.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a function invoked during setup that creates a socket connection to a remote IP, redirects standard I/O to this socket, and spawns a shell, effectively creating a backdoor. Variable and class names are obfuscated, indicating malicious intent. The code's behavior aligns with typical reverse shell malware. The package metadata falsely claims benign purpose, further indicating malicious intent. The connection to a suspicious IP and spawning of a shell during installation are clear indicators of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, establishing a remote backdoor during installation, with high confidence. It exhibits obfuscation and dangerous behavior, justifying maximum malware and security risk scores.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
