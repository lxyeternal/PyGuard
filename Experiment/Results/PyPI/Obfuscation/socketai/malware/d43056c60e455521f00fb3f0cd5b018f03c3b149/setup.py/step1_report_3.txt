{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a malicious Python package designed to execute a remote shell and establish a backdoor connection to a specified IP address and port, while also masquerading as a legitimate package setup script.",
  "sources": "The source of data includes the socket connection to the hardcoded IP and port, the request to a remote URL using os.getlogin() for user info, and package metadata containing author information.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the socket connection which may be used to execute remote commands, spawning a shell (pty.spawn('sh')), and HTTP GET request to an external URL with user info, potentially leaking data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the remote IP address (hardcoded) through socket connection, and from the package metadata (author info and URL) which could be exploited for further malicious actions. The connection initiates in the custom develop class's method, which is invoked during package installation or development setup.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded IP and port, function that creates a reverse shell using socket and pty.spawn, and the obfuscated or non-descriptive class/method names suggest malicious intent. The code injects a backdoor during the install/develop phase. The request URL incorporates a username but uses an unrecognized domain, which may be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'yNbtyRHFfojPNESKYduvKoIfmXgLapCQ' that, when invoked, establishes a socket connection to a specific IP and port, likely for remote command execution, and spawns an interactive shell. It also attempts to send a request with the current username to an external URL. The custom classes 'EsxQyDAiPIekdcbicKsfBHUwdgOOtWzD' and 'rzahMnmXDrKYtNwGXdSCnZPXruYtbbAA' override setup commands for 'develop' and 'install' respectively, calling the malicious function during package installation or development. The package metadata describes a malicious actor, further indicating malicious intent. The presence of hardcoded IP, port, and reverse shell setup strongly suggests the code is designed to establish unauthorized remote access, constituting a backdoor.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and malicious. It sets up a backdoor by connecting to an external server and spawning a shell during package installation or development, with hardcoded remote server details. The package metadata also falsely claims to be a benign package. Overall, the package should not be used due to its malicious intent.",
