{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package setup script that, upon installation or development setup, executes potentially malicious code designed to connect to a remote server and spawn a shell, likely for unauthorized access.",
  "sources": "The malicious code is located in the 'yNbtyRHFfojPNESKYduvKoIfmXgLapCQ' function, which is called during the 'install' class's 'ycGwlaSQYAUTKGviKMctMUQFoHOLdgwY' method, triggered in the package installation process.",
  "sinks": "The code creates a socket connection to a remote IP address and port, redirects standard input/output/error to this connection, and spawns a shell ('sh'), which can allow remote command execution and control.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the 'ycGwlaSQYAUTKGviKMctMUQFoHOLdgwY' method of the 'install' class calls 'yNbtyRHFfojPNESKYduvKoIfmXgLapCQ', which establishes a network connection, duplicates socket file descriptors to standard streams, and spawns an interactive shell, enabling remote access.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and class names, function call during setup, connection to external IP, hardcoded IP address and port, and spawning a shell remotely are highly unusual and suspicious behaviors. The code appears intentionally designed to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a function that connects to an external IP address and port, then redirects system input/output streams to this socket, and spawns a shell. This behavior is triggered during the package's 'install' process by overriding the 'install' class's method. The setup metadata claims the package is malicious, indicating malicious intent. The use of obfuscated class and function names further suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The connection to a remote server and spawning of a shell are clear indicators of potential remote control or backdoor capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code that, during installation, establishes a remote connection to an attacker-controlled server, redirects I/O, and spawns a shell, effectively creating a backdoor. The obfuscation and behavior strongly indicate malicious intent. The package should be considered extremely dangerous and should not be used.",
