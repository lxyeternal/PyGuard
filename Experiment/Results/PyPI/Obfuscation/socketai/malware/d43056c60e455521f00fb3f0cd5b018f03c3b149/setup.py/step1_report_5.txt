{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious Python package designed to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server, potentially for unauthorized access or control of the host system.",
  "sources": "Reading system login information with os.getlogin(), hardcoded IP address and port, and package metadata (author info, URL).",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to remote IP and port, socket file descriptor duplication, spawning a shell via pty.spawn('sh').",
  "flows": "The code initiates by importing modules, then defines a function that retrieves login info, sends a request to a remote URL, and establishes a reverse shell connection. This function is called during the installation process via a custom install class, which executes the reverse shell setup during package install.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class and function names, hardcoded IP address and port, code that connects to external network addresses, and spawning a shell during package installation are highly unusual and suspicious for a benign package.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules but then defines variables with obfuscated names pointing to an external IP and port, indicative of command-and-control server communication. The function yNbtyRHFfojPNESKYduvKoIfmXgLapCQ() retrieves the system login, constructs a URL with a variable 'user' (which is undefined), makes a GET request to a requestbin.net URL, and establishes a socket connection to the hardcoded IP and port. It duplicates the socket file descriptor to standard input, output, and error, then spawns a shell using pty.spawn('sh'), effectively providing remote command execution. This function is invoked during the package's installation process via a custom 'install' class, which means installing this package would trigger the reverse shell automatically. The package metadata explicitly labels the package as malicious, further confirming intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior designed to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server during package installation, allowing unauthorized control over the host system. The code is intentionally obfuscated with suspicious variable names, hardcoded IP addresses, and network activities associated with malicious remote access.",
