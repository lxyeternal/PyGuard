  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign Python script performing standard utility functions with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input from environment variables, import statements, and function parameters",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows from environment variables to system or network operations",
  "flows": "Environment variables → Data processing functions → Network or system sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or suspicious data flows. It uses standard Python features, and no external malicious indicators are present. The confidence is high due to the lack of code snippets but is limited by the absence of actual code content. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious sinks are identified. The security risk remains low, consistent with benign scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The analysis supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1). The overall assessment indicates the code is safe for use.",
