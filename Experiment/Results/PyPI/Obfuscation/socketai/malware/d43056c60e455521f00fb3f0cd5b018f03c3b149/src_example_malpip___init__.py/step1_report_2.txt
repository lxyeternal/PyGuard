{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided, but it appears to be a Python module or script that imports various libraries, defines functions, and potentially interacts with the system or network.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, environment variables, and possibly user inputs or network sources (if present). Specific data sources are not clearly visible due to the absence of actual code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, file operations, or database interactions, depending on code behavior. Exact sinks are not identified without the code details.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network or file operations could occur. Without concrete code, precise flows cannot be determined.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies or malicious patterns are evident from the provided code snippet, which appears to consist of import statements and function definitions. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs are visible.",
  "analysis": "The analysis is limited by the absence of actual code implementation; only import statements and structural elements are present. There is no evidence of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security issues. Without concrete function or logic, it is impossible to identify malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be a standard Python script or module structure. However, due to the lack of detailed implementation, confidence in this conclusion is moderate.",
  "confidence": 0.5,
  "obfuscated": 0,
