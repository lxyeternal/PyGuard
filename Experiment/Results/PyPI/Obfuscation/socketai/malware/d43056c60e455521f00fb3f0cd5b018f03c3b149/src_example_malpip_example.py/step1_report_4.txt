  "purpose": "A simple function that increments a number by 1",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'number'",
  "sinks": "The return statement, which outputs the incremented number",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the output after being incremented",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated, but no malicious or suspicious code is present. There are no hidden or unusual operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with an obfuscated name that takes a numerical input and returns the input incremented by 1. No external data sources, environment variables, or sensitive data are accessed. The function's logic is straightforward and typical for a simple mathematical operation. The obfuscated name might be intended to hide its purpose, but it does not contain any malicious or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic, harmless operation with obfuscated naming. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious activity.",
