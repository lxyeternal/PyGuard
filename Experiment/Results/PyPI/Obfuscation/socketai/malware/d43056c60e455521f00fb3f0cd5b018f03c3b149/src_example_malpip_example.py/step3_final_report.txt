  "purpose": "A simple function that increments a number by 1.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputting the incremented number.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement after increment.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; code is trivial and straightforward; no external data sources or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic increment function with an obfuscated name. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious code are present. The obfuscation is limited to the function name, which does not impact behavior. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. Malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (~0.7), and security risk is minimal (~0.1). The code is benign and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, trivial increment function with obfuscated naming. No malicious intent or security risks are present. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious behavior.",
