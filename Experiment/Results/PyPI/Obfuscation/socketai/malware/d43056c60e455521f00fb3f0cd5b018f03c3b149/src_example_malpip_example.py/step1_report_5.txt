  "purpose": "A simple function that increments a number by 1.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the incremented number; no external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement, adding 1.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward with no hidden or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that takes a numeric input and returns the input incremented by one. There are no external data sources, no dynamic execution, no file or network operations, and no suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a trivial utility function with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain any obfuscation, malware, or security risks.",
