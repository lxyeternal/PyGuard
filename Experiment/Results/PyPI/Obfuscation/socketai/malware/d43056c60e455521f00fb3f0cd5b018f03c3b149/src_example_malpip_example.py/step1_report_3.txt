{
  "purpose": "A simple function that increments a number by one",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'number'",
  "sinks": "The return statement that outputs the incremented number",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the output after incrementing",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected; function name is obfuscated but it performs a basic increment operation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that takes a parameter 'number' and returns 'number + 1'. The logic is straightforward and typical. No external inputs, no network communication, no file operations, no environment variables, or other side effects are present. The obfuscated name may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but the function itself is benign and performs a simple arithmetic operation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple increment function with an obfuscated name, performing a benign operation. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
