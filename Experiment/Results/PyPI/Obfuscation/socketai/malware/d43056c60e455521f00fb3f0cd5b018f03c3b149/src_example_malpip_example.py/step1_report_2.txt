{
  "purpose": "A simple function that increments a given number by 1.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement output.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the output after incrementing.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated, but the code itself performs a benign increment operation without any malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The function takes a parameter 'number' and returns its value incremented by 1. The code is straightforward and lacks any external data reads, environment variable usage, or network activity. The obfuscated function name does not imply malicious intent, as it does not affect behavior. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign function with no malicious behavior. The obfuscated name alone does not indicate malicious intent, and the function performs a basic arithmetic operation.",
