{
  "purpose": "The function appears to increment a number by 1, likely intended for simple arithmetic or utility purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' which is used directly in the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement output; no external sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return statement with a simple increment operation.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is obfuscated and does not clearly indicate purpose. No other suspicious code or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single, straightforward function that adds 1 to its input. No external data sources, network activity, or file operations are present. The obfuscated function name may suggest an attempt to conceal purpose, but the function itself performs a benign arithmetic operation. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performs a simple increment operation, and shows no signs of malicious intent. The obfuscated name is likely for obfuscation but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
