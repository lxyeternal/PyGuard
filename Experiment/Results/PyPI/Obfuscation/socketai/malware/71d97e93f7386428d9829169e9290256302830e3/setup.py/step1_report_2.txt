  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with metadata and potentially execute hidden PowerShell command.",
  "sources": "Reading the existence of 'tahg' directory, importing modules, and executing subprocess with encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command, potentially running malicious code without visible window.",
  "flows": "Check if 'tahg' exists -> If not, run encoded PowerShell via subprocess -> The PowerShell command is a base64-encoded script that executes potentially malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command, hidden window execution, attempt to run background process without user awareness, minimal error handling suppressing failures.",
  "analysis": "The script first checks for the presence of a directory 'tahg'. If absent, it executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with the window hidden. The encoding suggests obfuscation, possibly to hide malicious intent. The code then proceeds to set up package metadata, which appears benign. The use of try-except blocks around both parts suppresses errors, making detection harder. The encoded command, when decoded, likely contains further malicious payload, as such obfuscation and background execution are common in malicious scripts. No other obvious malicious behavior or hardcoded credentials are present outside this obfuscated command execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior primarily through the execution of an encoded PowerShell command in the background without user awareness, indicating possible malicious intent or backdoor. The setup process appears benign but is likely a cover or second stage of malicious activity.",
