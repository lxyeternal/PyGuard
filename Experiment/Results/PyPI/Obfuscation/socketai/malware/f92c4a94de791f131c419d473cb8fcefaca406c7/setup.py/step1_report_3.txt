  "purpose": "Setup script that attempts to install a dependency and then executes a PowerShell command to download and run an executable from an external URL.",

  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing PowerShell command that downloads and executes external payload.",
  "flows": "Imports -> subprocess.run() -> PowerShell command downloading and executing remote executable.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual obfuscation of variable names; use of subprocess to run potentially malicious commands; download and execution of an external executable from a Dropbox URL; attempt to install 'subprocess' module dynamically (which is a standard library), likely unnecessary.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing distutils for setup, then attempts to import 'os' and 'subprocess', installing 'subprocess' if missing (which is generally unnecessary since it's a standard library). It then sets a variable 'MOmIfSShlKmQjkwVNQlcZRGhTmyQnPzb' to 'subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW', indicating an attempt to run without a window. The critical part is the subprocess.run() command which executes a PowerShell script that downloads a file from a Dropbox URL and executes it. This behavior strongly suggests malicious activity, as it downloads and runs external executables without user consent. The setup() function appears unrelated to the malicious behavior, but its presence does not mitigate the malicious intent. Overall, the code contains suspicious behavior involving remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to silently download and execute a remote executable via PowerShell, indicating malicious intent. The variable obfuscation and dynamic installation attempts further support suspicion. This code poses a high security risk and should be considered malicious.",
