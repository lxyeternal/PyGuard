{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with embedded malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Reads from the network via PowerShell command; attempts to install subprocess (unnecessary), executes remote payload.",
  "sinks": "Executes downloaded payload via PowerShell, potentially running malicious executable.",
  "flows": "Code downloads a file from a remote URL and executes it, potentially executing malicious code on the host machine.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual attempt to install 'subprocess' module (which is standard), use of obscure variable names, execution of external commands with powershell, and downloading and executing an executable from a suspicious URL.",
  "analysis": "The script tries to import 'os' and 'subprocess', forcibly installs 'subprocess' if not present (though it's part of standard library), then runs a PowerShell command to download and execute a remote executable. The variable name 'MOmIfSShlKmQjkwVNQlcZRGhTmyQnPzb' is obfuscated. The PowerShell command uses Invoke-WebRequest to download 'Oxzy.exe' from a Dropbox URL and runs it directly. This behavior strongly indicates malicious intent, as it downloads and executes a potentially harmful executable during package setup. The try-except blocks swallow all exceptions, making detection harder and hiding malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation. The obfuscated variable name and redundant installation attempt further suggest malicious intent. This package poses a high security risk and should not be used.",
