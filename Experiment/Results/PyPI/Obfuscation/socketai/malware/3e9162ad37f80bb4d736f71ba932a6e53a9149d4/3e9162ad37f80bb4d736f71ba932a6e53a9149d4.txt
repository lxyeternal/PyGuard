      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign in its current form, with obfuscation being the primary red flag. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The low security risk score reflects this, though obfuscation warrants cautious review if more code is present. Overall, the package appears safe based solely on this snippet."
