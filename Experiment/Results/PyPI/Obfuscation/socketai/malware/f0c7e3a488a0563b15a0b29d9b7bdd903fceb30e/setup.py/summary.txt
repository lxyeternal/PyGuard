  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through remote code fetching and execution, obfuscated variable names, and suspicious process invocation. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is confirmed. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; the malware score should be 1, obfuscation around 0.8, and overall risk at 1.0. The code should be treated as malicious and flagged accordingly."
