  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell command during package setup, conditioned on filesystem state. The behavior aligns with common malware tactics, justifying high malware and risk scores. It should be treated as a serious security concern pending further analysis of the encoded payload."
