{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package, with an additional attempt to execute a PowerShell command, potentially as part of a malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads the file system to check for the existence of 'tahg' and executes a subprocess to run a PowerShell command encoded in Base64.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command that is Base64-encoded, which can be used to hide malicious payloads or actions.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg', then conditionally executes the encoded PowerShell command, potentially performing hidden or malicious actions without user awareness.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command with 'powershell -EncodedCommand' is suspicious, especially combined with the 'Hidden' window style. The code also proceeds silently on exceptions, hiding failures. The command string is obfuscated, indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a standard setup import from distutils, then attempts to import subprocess and os modules. It checks if a specific directory 'tahg' exists; if not, it executes a subprocess running a Base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window style, which is often used to conceal malicious activity. The PowerShell command appears obfuscated. The setup call with package metadata is standard, but the silent exception handling means failures in executing the command or setup won't raise alerts. Overall, the use of obfuscated encoded commands executed silently indicates malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious indicators, notably the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command with hidden window style, which could be used for malicious purposes. The setup function is legitimate but secondary. The overall risk score is high due to the hidden execution behavior.",
