      "conclusion": "The code is a benign static setup script with obfuscated identifiers. No active malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious activity. Scores should reflect low malware risk, moderate obfuscation, and minimal security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates a high likelihood of malicious behavior through remote code fetching and execution without validation, representing a severe security threat. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with a very high malware and risk score, and an increased obfuscation score due to variable name obfuscation."
