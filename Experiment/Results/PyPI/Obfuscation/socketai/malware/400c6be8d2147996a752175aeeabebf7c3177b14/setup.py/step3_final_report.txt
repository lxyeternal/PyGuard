  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution; static setup configuration.",
  "sources": "No dynamic input; static variables and metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated package name 'gbq17ops0ia7nbba' and variable 'nKwALlvLczwzzIRATiZJeKCXYtUnbpnV' assigned to 'keywords' but unused; indicates obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with static metadata. The package name and variable names are suspiciously obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply obfuscation. No dynamic code, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The variable is unused beyond assignment, suggesting possible dead code or obfuscation. The malware score should be zero, as no malicious activity is detected. The obfuscation score can be moderate (~0.3) due to naming patterns. The overall security risk is very low (~0.2), as the code is benign but employs obfuscation that warrants cautious monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static setup script with obfuscated identifiers. No active malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious activity. Scores should reflect low malware risk, moderate obfuscation, and minimal security threat.",
