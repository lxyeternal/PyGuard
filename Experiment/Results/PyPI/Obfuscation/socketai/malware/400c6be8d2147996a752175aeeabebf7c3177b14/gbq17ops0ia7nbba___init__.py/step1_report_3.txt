  "purpose": "The code attempts to fetch and execute remote code from a specified URL.",

  "flows": "requests.get() fetches remote data -> exec() executes fetched code",
  "anomalies": "Uses exec() on data obtained from a URL without validation; attempts to silently install requests library if missing",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing standard libraries and ensuring 'requests' is installed. It then retrieves content from a remote URL and executes it directly using exec(). This pattern indicates potential malicious intent, as executing remote code without validation is highly risky. The use of try-except around the remote fetch and exec, with a broad exception, suggests an attempt to hide failures or obfuscate malicious activity. The code does not sanitize or verify the fetched content, increasing the risk of executing harmful payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code dynamically fetches and executes remote code without validation, a common pattern for malicious scripts or backdoors. The use of exec() on external content is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent.",
