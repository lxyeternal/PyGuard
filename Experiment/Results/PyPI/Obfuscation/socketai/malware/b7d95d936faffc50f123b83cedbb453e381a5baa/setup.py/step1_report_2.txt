{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, with a custom installation command that collects system information and sends it to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname via socket.gethostname(), current working directory via os.getcwd(), and username via getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The data is sent to an external domain ('fo7288ar9hjgo6tp8p6c1efxpovgja7z.oastify.com') through an HTTP GET request using the requests library.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, cwd, username) flows into a dictionary, which is then sent as URL parameters to an external server in the requests.get() call.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration without user consent, using a seemingly obfuscated class name and variable names, which may indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. The URL domain appears suspicious, possibly used for tracking or malicious purposes. The custom install command executes during package installation, which can be used maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup.py file with a custom install class that, upon installation, collects system information—hostname, current directory, username—and sends this data to an external server. The obfuscated class and variable names suggest an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The external request occurs without any user confirmation or legitimate reason, indicating potential data theft or tracking. The code does not perform any other malicious actions like file modifications or system compromise, but exfiltration during package install is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be malicious due to its data exfiltration behavior during installation, using obfuscated identifiers and sending system info to an external domain. It suggests an attempt at user tracking or malicious data theft. The malicious activity is limited to info exfiltration, with no evidence of system compromise, but the behavior is suspicious enough to consider this package dangerous.",
