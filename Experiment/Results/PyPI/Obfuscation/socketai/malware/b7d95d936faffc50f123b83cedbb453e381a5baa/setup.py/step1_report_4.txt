  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup that executes a custom installation step which gathers system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), requests.get() with URL",
  "sinks": "requests.get() which sends data to an external domain",
  "flows": "System info collected from hostname, current directory, username → sent via requests.get() to remote server",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated class and method names; sending system info during install process; contact with suspicious domain 'fo7288ar9hjgo6tp8p6c1efxpovgja7z.oastify.com'",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration with a custom install command class. During installation, it collects hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external, suspicious domain. The class and method names are obfuscated, which is often a sign of malicious intent or attempts to hide behavior. The data transmission occurs as part of the installation process, which could be exploited to exfiltrate user data without consent. The domain used is suspicious and could be used for tracking or data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs system information collection and exfiltration during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The obfuscation and external network request during install raise security concerns.",
