  "sinks": "requests.get() call to an external domain with collected system data",
  "flows": "System information collected (hostname, cwd, username) -> sent via GET request to external server",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and function names; data exfiltration to an external domain during installation; no user interaction or consent prompt; the external URL is obscure and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that inherits from setuptools' install command. During installation, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via a GET request to a suspicious domain 'fo7288ar9hjgo6tp8p6c1efxpovgja7z.oastify.com', likely for tracking or malicious data collection. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The data exfiltration occurs automatically during package installation, which is suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malicious payload execution or backdoors, but the exfiltration of system info without user consent is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be malicious, performing unauthorized data exfiltration during installation by sending system information to an external server. Its obfuscation and behavior strongly suggest malicious intent.",
