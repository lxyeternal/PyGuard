{
  "purpose": "Create a Python package setup script that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with URL and parameters containing system info",
  "flows": "Data from socket, os, and getpass are gathered and then sent via requests.get() to an external domain",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names, obfuscated function names, and the explicit collection and transmission of host and user info during installation without user consent",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during the installation process, gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain. The use of non-descriptive, obfuscated variable and function names indicates an attempt to hide behavior. The data collection and outbound network request occur silently during package installation, which can be considered malicious or at least suspicious as it compromises user privacy and system security without disclosure or consent.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs unauthorized collection and transmission of system information during package installation, which is malicious behavior aimed at tracking or spying on users. The obfuscated code and unsolicited network request strongly suggest malicious intent.",
