{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during package installation, collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and exfiltrates it to an external server via an HTTP GET request.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to external domain with collected data",
  "flows": "source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> data aggregation -> requests.get() to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, data exfiltration during installation without user consent, communication with suspicious external domain",
  "analysis": "The code performs unauthorized collection of system info during package installation, sending data to a suspicious domain. Obfuscation indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent. No other malicious payloads or backdoors are present. The network request occurs automatically during install, with no user notification. The behavior aligns with malicious activity, specifically privacy invasion and data exfiltration. The obfuscation and external communication justify high malware and security risk scores. The code does not execute destructive payloads but performs stealthy data collection, which is considered malicious in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation without user consent, using obfuscation to hide intent, and communicating with a suspicious external domain. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reflect the severity of this privacy violation.",
