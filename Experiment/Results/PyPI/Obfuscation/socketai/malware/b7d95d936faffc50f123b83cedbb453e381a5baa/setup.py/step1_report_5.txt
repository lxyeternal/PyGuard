{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, gathers system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (`socket.gethostname()`), current working directory (`os.getcwd()`), and username (`getpass.getuser()`).",
  "sinks": "Sends collected system information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain ('fo7288ar9hjgo6tp8p6c1efxpovgja7z.oastify.com').",
  "flows": "Collects system info from sources, then transmits data to external server in the overridden install command (`GXpdwQnBZAZcIeleAMJZJDAiDvshtGMD`).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, usage of requests to send system info to an external server without user consent, and the method is invoked during package installation. The domain is suspicious and could be used for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, during package installation, collects hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a potentially malicious or tracking domain. The use of obfuscated identifiers and the external request during install are suspicious. There are no hardcoded credentials or malicious system modifications observed, but the data exfiltration behavior indicates malicious intent or privacy violation. The code's structure suggests it is designed to stealthily gather and transmit user system info.",
  "conclusion": "The code attempts to gather user system information and transmit it to an external domain during package installation. This behavior is suspicious and indicates possible malicious intent, such as data harvesting or tracking. The obfuscated class and method names further support malicious or covert activity.",
