{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated Python code likely intended for malicious obfuscation, potentially part of a malicious supply chain or backdoor mechanism.",
  "sources": "Numerous string variables assigned large strings, and multiple large numeric variables assigned seemingly arbitrary values. The only explicit code interaction is the setup() function call with a potentially dynamic package name.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function with a formatted string involving a variable ('LKEK') suggests dynamic dependency specification, potentially loading malicious dependencies or manipulating installation process.",
  "flows": "Variables are assigned large strings and numbers, with no clear data flow; the setup() call with a formatted dependency name is a potential sink where external data or variables might influence behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Extreme obfuscation with nonsensical variable names, many large large string literals, and dynamic string formatting in setup() without clear purpose. No readable logic or comments. The code appears designed to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated, with meaningless variable names and large string literals that are not processed in any visible logic. The only function call is to setuptools.setup with a dynamic dependency version, which is constructed using an uninitialized or external variable 'LKEK'. The absence of meaningful operations, combined with obfuscation, suggests an attempt to hide malicious behavior, possibly to inject malicious dependencies during package installation. The presence of numerous large strings and variables could be an attempt at code bloat or to evade simple static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated and contains suspicious patterns such as dynamic dependency injection and meaningless large string variables. It does not perform any legitimate logic and appears designed to hide malicious behavior, potentially to load malicious dependencies or perform malicious actions during package installation.",
