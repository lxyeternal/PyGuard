  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with patterns typical of malicious payloads or sabotage, especially in dependency injection. While no active malicious actions are directly observed, the structure suggests an intent to conceal malicious behavior or dependencies. The risk is elevated if external control over 'LKEK' exists, which could enable dependency hijacking or code execution. Overall, the code warrants cautious handling and further dynamic or source validation."
