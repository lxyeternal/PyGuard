{
  "purpose": "The code is primarily a collection of heavily obfuscated variable assignments, large string literals, and a single setup() call with a dependency specified via a variable 'LKEK'. It appears designed to conceal its true intent, potentially to manipulate dependencies or hide malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "The variables assigned large strings or numbers, and the setup() function where 'install_requires' is constructed using the variable 'LKEK'. The source of any external influence would be the value of 'LKEK' if controllable externally.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function's 'install_requires' parameter, which could be manipulated to load malicious dependencies if 'LKEK' is externally controlled. No other active sinks such as network calls or file operations are evident.",
  "flows": "The flow involves the variable 'LKEK' influencing the dependency version string in setup(), which could lead to malicious dependency injection if 'LKEK' is externally controlled. No other data flows or code execution paths are visible.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable names, large string literals, and the dynamic construction of dependencies via an undefined variable 'LKEK'. The code lacks meaningful logic or control flow, indicating concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code's obfuscation and reliance on a variable 'LKEK' for dependency specification suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent, such as dependency hijacking or sabotage. The absence of active malicious actions (network activity, code execution, file manipulation) indicates that the threat is concealed rather than executed. The pattern is consistent across multiple similar snippets, reinforcing suspicion. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the potential for malicious dependency injection warrants a high malware risk score, especially if 'LKEK' can be externally manipulated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with patterns typical of malicious payloads or sabotage, especially in dependency injection. While no active malicious actions are directly observed, the structure suggests an intent to conceal malicious behavior or dependencies. The risk is elevated if external control over 'LKEK' exists, which could enable dependency hijacking or code execution. Overall, the code warrants cautious handling and further dynamic or source validation.",
