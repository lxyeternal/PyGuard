{
  "purpose": "The script appears to define a setup configuration for a Python package, including a custom installation command that executes code conditionally on Windows.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'os.name' and uses imported modules 'os', 'requests', and 'fernet'. It also contains embedded encrypted data for decryption.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of decrypted code via 'exec' when on Windows, which could run malicious code if the decryption payload is harmful.",
  "flows": "On Windows, the environment variable 'os.name' triggers the import of 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts and executes the embedded payload via 'exec'.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed dynamically, conditional execution based on OS, use of 'exec' with decrypted content, and obfuscated variable names.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a setup script with a custom installation class. It conditionally executes an embedded encrypted payload when on Windows ('nt' OS). The payload is decrypted with Fernet symmetric encryption, then executed with 'exec', which is a security risk if the payload is malicious. The code uses obfuscated variable names and includes an embedded encrypted string, suggesting an attempt to conceal behavior. Since the decrypted content is executed dynamically, this constitutes a significant security concern. The rest of the setup code appears standard for packaging, with no other suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious pattern: encrypted payload decrypted and executed conditionally on Windows, indicating malicious intent. This is a serious security risk, as it can run arbitrary code during installation, potentially leading to system compromise.",
