  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior, executing an obfuscated PowerShell payload silently during package setup. The high obfuscation, stealth, and potential for system compromise justify a malware score of approximately 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9. It should be treated as malicious or compromised."
