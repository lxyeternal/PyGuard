  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to S3 transfers and retries.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and imports.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows or external data sources and sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward and uses standard exception class definitions; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious constructs, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'CancelledError' from 'concurrent.futures' and defines several custom exception classes for error handling. The 'RetriesExceededError' stores the last exception and has a default message. 'FatalError' subclasses 'CancelledError' and adds a docstring. All classes are standard and do not contain malicious behavior or suspicious patterns. There are no external inputs, data flows, or security risks evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard set of exception class definitions for managing transfer-related errors. No malicious behavior, suspicious activities, or security risks are present.",
