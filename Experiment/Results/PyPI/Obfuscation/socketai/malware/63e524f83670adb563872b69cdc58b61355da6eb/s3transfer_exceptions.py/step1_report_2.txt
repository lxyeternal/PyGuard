{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to retries, S3 uploads, subscriber methods, transfer completion, and cancellation within a larger AWS-related application.",
  "sources": "N/A (no input reading code, environment variables, or external data sources involved).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data leaks, external communications, or sensitive data handling).",
  "flows": "N/A (no source-to-sink data flows present).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions, inheriting from standard Python exception types. It imports a single module, 'concurrent.futures.CancelledError,' and extends it with a custom FatalError class. The exception classes are straightforward, used for error handling in AWS transfer or upload operations. No external inputs, environment variables, or suspicious code behavior detected. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of custom exception definitions for error handling in an AWS transfer context. It appears legitimate, with no malicious behavior or security issues. It is part of a larger AWS SDK or application codebase, likely related to S3 or transfer management. No security concerns are evident.",
