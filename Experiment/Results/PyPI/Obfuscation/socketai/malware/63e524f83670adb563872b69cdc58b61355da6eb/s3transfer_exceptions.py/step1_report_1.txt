  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors in an AWS S3 transfer or upload process.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; this is a module defining exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data output or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; code consists solely of class definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library component and defines several custom exception classes, including a subclass of CancelledError. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external calls, and no suspicious logic. The class implementations are straightforward and serve as error indicators. The code appears to be part of a larger, well-documented library for AWS S3 transfer operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The purpose is to facilitate error reporting in an AWS-related context, with no malicious intent.",
