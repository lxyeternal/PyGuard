{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to transfer failures and errors, primarily for an AWS S3 transfer utility.",
  "sources": "The code defines exception classes and imports the CancelledError class from the concurrent.futures module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks as the code only defines exceptions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; straightforward class definitions and import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception classes used for error handling in a transfer context, such as retries, upload failures, invalid methods, and transfer cancellation. It imports a standard library exception and extends it. No suspicious logic, malicious code, or obfuscation is present. No external data handling or sensitive information is involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is a standard, safe component for handling errors in a larger transfer system.",
