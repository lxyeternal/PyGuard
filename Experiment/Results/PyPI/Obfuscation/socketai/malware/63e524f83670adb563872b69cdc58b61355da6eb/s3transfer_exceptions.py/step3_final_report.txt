  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for AWS S3 transfer and upload error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code imports 'CancelledError' from 'concurrent.futures' for inheritance.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code only defines exception classes without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception classes are used for error signaling within larger systems but do not process data themselves.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple, standard exception class definitions for AWS transfer errors. It imports a standard library exception and subclasses it for specific error types. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior is present. The code serves as part of an error handling framework and does not perform any data processing or external communication. The absence of hardcoded secrets, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns indicates a benign purpose. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "This supply chain component is benign, serving as a set of exception classes for AWS transfer error handling. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard practices, warranting a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0.",
