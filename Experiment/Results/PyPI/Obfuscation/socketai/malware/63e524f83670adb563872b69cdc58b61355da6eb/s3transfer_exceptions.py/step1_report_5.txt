{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a transfer or upload process, possibly related to S3 operations.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only class definitions and import statements, with no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or external outputs within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'CancelledError' from 'concurrent.futures' and defines several custom exception classes, inheriting from built-in or other exception classes. The classes are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic. They serve as error indicators likely used in a larger context of a file transfer or S3 interaction system. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions for handling errors in a transfer system, with no malicious or security-related issues detected. It appears benign and standard.",
