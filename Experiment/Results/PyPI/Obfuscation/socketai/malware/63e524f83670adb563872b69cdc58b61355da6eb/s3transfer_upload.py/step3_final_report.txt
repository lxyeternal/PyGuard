{
  "purpose": "This code manages Amazon S3 uploads, supporting multipart uploads, progress tracking, and handling various input sources such as filenames, seekable, and non-seekable streams. It orchestrates upload tasks, including creation, part uploads, and completion, using AWS SDK calls.",
  "sources": "File-like objects, filenames (strings), and input streams provided via call_args.fileobj.",
  "sinks": "AWS S3 service via SDK calls (put_object, upload_part, create_multipart_upload, complete_multipart_upload). Progress callbacks and transfer coordinator error propagation are involved but not malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "Input sources (file objects or filenames) are wrapped with interrupt and bandwidth-limited streams, then passed to AWS SDK calls. Progress callbacks aggregate and invoke during data transfer. Multipart parts are read from input streams and uploaded via separate tasks, culminating in a complete multipart upload.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected. The code uses standard AWS SDK patterns, with no hidden backdoors or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, standard implementation for S3 uploads, supporting multiple input types and multipart uploads. It employs progress callbacks, error handling via transfer coordinator, and safe stream wrapping. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The use of in-memory buffers for non-seekable streams and deferred file opening are standard practices. No obfuscation or suspicious network activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured AWS S3 upload utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It follows best practices for file handling, multipart uploads, and progress tracking. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1).",
