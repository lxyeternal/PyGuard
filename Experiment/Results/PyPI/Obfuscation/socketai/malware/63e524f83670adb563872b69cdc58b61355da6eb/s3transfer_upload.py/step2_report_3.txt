  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and assess the scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The report correctly describes the code's purpose: managing S3 uploads, including multipart support, progress tracking, and input handling. The sources and sinks are accurately identified, with no malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are detected. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with standard AWS SDK usage.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that the code is legitimate and safe is justified, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk low (0.1). This aligns well with the detailed reasoning.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to report 1, it describes a standard upload management system, with input sources and network interactions via AWS SDK.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The malware score is slightly above zero (0.05), which might be conservative, but given the absence of suspicious behavior, this is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that the code is safe and standard is reasonable. Malware score is very low, and the overall security risk is minimal.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Consistent with previous reports, handling various input streams and progress callbacks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. The code is a typical implementation of an S3 upload utility.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The low malware score (0) and security risk (0.2) are appropriate. The confidence level (0.95) is justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** The description aligns with the code's functionality—upload management, multipart, progress.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses standard SDK calls and common patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The malware score is 0, security risk low, consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Same pattern—file upload handling with progress and interruption support.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The code is standard for AWS S3 uploads.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Malware score 0, security risk low, matching the thorough reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports are consistent with benign, legitimate code. Slightly above zero in some cases (e.g., 0.05) likely due to conservative estimation, but no evidence supports malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is accurate given the code clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero but low overall, reflecting standard upload logic with minimal security concerns.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard upload code with minimal security considerations; no evident vulnerabilities or malicious features)\n\n**Final note:** The detailed analysis confirms that the code is a legitimate, well-structured AWS S3 upload utility, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.",
