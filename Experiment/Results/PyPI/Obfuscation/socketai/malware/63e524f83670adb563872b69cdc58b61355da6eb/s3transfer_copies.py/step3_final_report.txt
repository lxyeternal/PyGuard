{
  "purpose": "The code manages AWS S3 copy operations, including multipart uploads, with parameter filtering and progress tracking.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'call_args', 'extra_args', and transfer size metadata, read during head_object, copy_object, upload_part_copy, and request parameter setup.",
  "sinks": "AWS SDK methods: head_object, copy_object, upload_part_copy, complete_multipart_upload, create_multipart_upload, and related tasks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into SDK calls, with size calculations and parameter filtering, leading to network requests and progress callbacks.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. Parameter filtering mitigates misuse of 'extra_args'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard S3 copy and multipart upload operations using boto3 SDK, with appropriate size calculations, parameter filtering, and progress callbacks. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert activities are present. The code relies on external inputs but filters potentially dangerous parameters. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical AWS SDK usage for copying objects, including multipart support for large files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of S3 copy operations, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The low scores for malware (0), obfuscation (0), and risk (~0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
