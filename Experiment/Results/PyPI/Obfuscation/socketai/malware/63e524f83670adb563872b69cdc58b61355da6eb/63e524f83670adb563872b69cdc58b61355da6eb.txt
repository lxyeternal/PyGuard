      "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python setup script with an obfuscated package name that warrants caution but shows no signs of malware or security issues. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is approximately 0.2–0.3 due to the suspicious name, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1–0.2)."

      "conclusion": "This supply chain component is benign, serving as a set of exception classes for AWS transfer error handling. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard practices, warranting a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0."

The primary concern is operational risk from misuse, not security vulnerabilities. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) reflecting the destructive potential if misused."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate S3 transfer utility with advanced features. However, the repeated use of obfuscated exec() statements decoding to import modules is a red flag that warrants further investigation. No direct evidence of malicious activity is present, but the obfuscation pattern increases the risk profile. It is recommended to decode and analyze the base64 payloads to confirm their intent before deployment."
