  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python setup script with an obfuscated package name that warrants caution but shows no signs of malware or security issues. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is approximately 0.2–0.3 due to the suspicious name, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1–0.2)."
