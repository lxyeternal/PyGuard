  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate S3 transfer utility with advanced features. However, the repeated use of obfuscated exec() statements decoding to import modules is a red flag that warrants further investigation. No direct evidence of malicious activity is present, but the obfuscation pattern increases the risk profile. It is recommended to decode and analyze the base64 payloads to confirm their intent before deployment."
