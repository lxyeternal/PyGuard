  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with metadata and potentially execute hidden PowerShell commands during installation.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('tahg'), subprocess.Popen() with encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "Execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen",
  "flows": "Check if 'tahg' exists -> if not, run PowerShell encoded command via subprocess, during setup process",
  "anomalies": "Use of hidden window style and encoded PowerShell command, no explanation for its purpose, attempt to run potentially suspicious command silently",
  "analysis": "The code first attempts to check for the existence of a file named 'tahg'. If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen, passing an encoded command string. The command appears to be obfuscated, potentially malicious, designed to run silently in the background. The setup() function is called with package metadata, which is standard. The use of encoded PowerShell commands and silent execution suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The overall structure indicates a malicious behavior, possibly to establish persistence, download additional payloads, or exfiltrate data. No legitimate purpose is evident for executing hidden PowerShell commands during package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious activity through hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscated commands, likely malicious. It attempts to run silently during package setup, which is unusual for legitimate code. This indicates a high probability of malicious intent.",
