  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on supply chain threats, suspicious patterns, and code anomalies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network sockets, hardcoded strings, input functions, file reads, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, eval()/exec() execution, data transmission, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources (e.g., environment variables, untrusted input) to sinks (network, eval/exec, file), indicating potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, URLs, use of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, obfuscated code segments, dynamic code execution, embedded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code contains suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, eval()/exec() with untrusted input, obfuscation, and network activity, indicating high malicious potential. Other samples show benign patterns with no suspicious activity, consistent with low malware and risk scores. The high malware score (0.65) and obfuscation (0.7) for the suspicious code are justified. Benign samples have scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, with low risk scores (~0.1-0.3). The confidence levels align with the described patterns and analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates that only one report (Report 3) shows significant malicious indicators, justified by high malware and obfuscation scores. The remaining reports are benign, with scores appropriately reflecting their content. No adjustments are necessary; the scores are consistent with the evidence.",
