  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to a Python package, potentially involving data processing or utility functions. The specific intent is unclear due to the lack of comments and context.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network connections, file writes, or data serialization/deserialization. Specific sinks are not explicitly visible in the snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as inputs, environment variables, or external data into processing functions, and potentially to sinks like system calls or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Lack of comments or descriptive variable names could suggest obfuscation, but not necessarily malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code should be reviewed thoroughly for any use of eval, exec, or dynamic imports that could execute untrusted data. Check for network connections to suspicious domains, or any code that accesses sensitive system data without clear purpose. As the code content was not provided in the prompt, a detailed line-by-line analysis cannot be performed. Given the lack of suspicious patterns or malicious constructs in the visible structure, the code appears benign. However, the absence of actual code limits certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information and the structure of the code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard, with no obvious indicators of malware or malicious intent. However, without the actual code content, the confidence is limited.",
