  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging, with obfuscated variable names and cryptography dependencies.",
  "sources": "The dictionary 'wLommCBAirJKWmvGctnoLKOCAhkYrLPc' providing metadata; the list 'uHQefbjVAnwojjTmVBwQNZBREtbotsGu' specifying dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or data leaks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The setup() function uses the obfuscated metadata and dependencies to configure package installation; no malicious data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and cryptography modules included as dependencies; no active malicious code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation and common cryptography dependencies. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely to obscure trivial details. The inclusion of cryptography modules is typical in security-related packages but could be misused; however, no malicious activity is evident. The malware score is low, consistent with the absence of malicious code. The obfuscation score is high due to variable naming. The security risk score remains low, reflecting cautious review due to obfuscation and dependencies but no active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated setup script with cryptography dependencies. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are detected. Obfuscation warrants cautious review in sensitive contexts, but overall, the package appears safe based on this static analysis.",
