  "purpose": "This code appears to be a malicious stealer and information exfiltration tool targeting various browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, gaming accounts, and other sensitive data sources on a victim's system. It collects credentials, cookies, browser data, wallet information, and other personal files, then exfiltrates them to a remote webhook.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, system directories (e.g., browser profiles, wallet folders, cookies, logs), and network responses (e.g., geolocation, Discord API). It reads files such as cookies, login data, local state files, logs, and user directories containing sensitive data.",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected data to external URLs (webhook URL and file upload service), performs network requests (POST, GET, uploading files), and writes data into local files. It also terminates processes, copies and reads browser and wallet data, and archives files before uploading.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system directories and files into the script via directory traversal and file reading functions, then through data processing (decoding, decrypting), and finally exfiltrates via network requests (HTTP POSTs and uploads to remote servers). Specific flows include reading browser cookies, login info, local storage, wallet files, and system info, then sending or uploading the data.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes extensive process termination commands, dynamic process handling, thread-based multi-tasking, encrypted data decryption, obfuscated variable names, and extensive use of threading for concurrent operations. The code also performs silent process killing, zipping, and uploading of system and browser data, which is typical of malware. Many variable names and code segments are obfuscated or nonsensical, and there are suspicious function names like 'daaGTHcSKCJYgRHzuHrFsSlZxvctYkcW' and 'tLgjWZhbSXbYgYbiZyKBreoQrQbWBeUN'. Also, some references to remote URLs and complex encryption/decryption routines are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing numerous modules, including system, threading, cryptography, requests, and system file handling, indicating complex operations. It defines many functions for data collection: reading browser data, cookies, passwords, local state files, and other sensitive info. It employs threading to perform multiple system scans concurrently, indicating an intent to quickly gather extensive data. It decrypts encrypted wallet and browser data using system encryption keys, likely extracted from system files and memory. It also performs process termination for specified applications, archives data into zip files, and uploads them to external servers (via 'https://webhook.wyvern.lol' and 'gofile.io'). Many functions are designed for specific data theft, such as collecting cookies, passwords, browser histories, wallets, and other credentials. The code contains numerous obfuscated variable names and complex control flows, which are typical in malicious scripts to hinder analysis. The script performs environment checks, process manipulation, file copying, and uploading, which are classic behaviors for information stealers. The script’s ultimate goal appears to be to extract personal, financial, and system data, then send it to a remote attacker-controlled endpoint, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, functioning as an information stealer targeting browsers, wallets, and other sensitive data sources. It employs obfuscation, process termination, multi-threaded data collection, decryption routines, and remote data exfiltration to perform its malicious activities. The overall security risk is extremely high, and it should be considered dangerous and unsuitable for execution.",
