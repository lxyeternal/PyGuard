{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a malicious information stealer targeting various browsers, messaging apps, and cryptocurrency wallets. It collects sensitive data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, and files from the user system and exfiltrates them to a remote webhook.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input and data from system directories, browser storage, wallet files, and various local files. It also reads environment variables, local configuration files, and local database files.",
  "sinks": "It sends collected data to a remote URL (webhook) using HTTP POST requests, uploads files via file upload services, and exfiltrates data through Discord API calls and Gofile uploads.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local system directories, browser data folders, wallet and app data files into in-memory variables, then is compiled into formatted messages or files which are uploaded or sent via HTTP requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated or misleading variable names, functions performing system and network operations, repeated code patterns for different targets, and attempts to hide malicious activities within generic functions. It also uses non-standard or incorrect function calls, inconsistent code formatting, and possibly missing or undefined variables, indicating obfuscation or deliberate concealment.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to gather sensitive user data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, and files from browsers, wallets, gaming platforms, and messaging apps. It uses threading to concurrently process multiple targets, performs database extraction, decrypts encrypted keys, and uploads or sends data to external servers via webhooks or file-sharing services. Several functions are involved in extracting and exfiltrating data, including database copying, decryption, and network requests. The code employs obfuscation techniques like misleading variable names, inconsistent indentation, and dynamic code execution hints, making static analysis challenging. The presence of functions dedicated to stealing cookies, passwords, tokens, and files strongly suggests malicious intent. The code also features functions to kill processes and compress data, which are typical in malware used for exfiltration and covertness.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, designed to steal user credentials, session tokens, cookies, and files from a wide range of applications and browsers, then exfiltrate the data to remote servers. Its obfuscation, extensive system access, and data exfiltration methods confirm malicious behavior. The code demonstrates clear intent to compromise user privacy and system security.",
