{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for malicious data collection, including stealing user credentials, cookies, browser information, and potentially sensitive files from the system. It exfiltrates this data to remote servers and performs various intrusive activities such as process termination and file zipping.",
  "sources": "Data is read from system files (browser storage, wallet files, login databases, local states), environment variables, and user directories such as Desktop, Downloads, and Documents. It also reads process information, cookies, login data, and other user-related files.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to remote URLs (webhook and file upload servers), subprocess commands killing processes, file creation, and zip file creation. Data exfiltration occurs via HTTP POST requests and URL requests. Sensitive data is written to files and sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Sources (system files, environment variables, user directories) feed into data processing functions. Extracted data (credentials, cookies, files) is packaged and sent to remote servers via POST requests or URL requests. The code also terminates processes and archives files as part of its data collection process.",
  "anomalies": "The code exhibits obfuscation, such as dynamic variable names and complex control flow, making analysis difficult. It contains functions for stealing cookies, passwords, and files, and kills processes related to browsers and wallets. There are multiple network interactions to exfiltrate data. It attempts to bypass detection by copying and zipping files, then deleting originals. Usage of hardcoded URLs, process termination, and extensive system file access are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical info-stealing malware, targeting browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, and various user data. It collects login credentials, cookies, saved passwords, and other sensitive files from specific directories. It uses threading to perform concurrent operations, such as process termination, file copying, and data exfiltration. The functions for reading browser local storage and SQLite databases indicate intent to extract stored credentials. It employs obfuscation techniques to hide its malicious activities. The code also terminates processes related to browsers or wallets before archiving files, likely to access locked data. The exfiltration involves uploading files to file-sharing servers and sending data to Discord via webhooks, typical for malware C2 communications. The code also attempts to collect and process URL patterns, possibly for further exploitation or reconnaissance.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and malicious in intent. It functions as a credential, cookie, and data stealer, targeting multiple applications and files on the system. It exfiltrates stolen data to external servers and employs process killing and file archiving techniques to evade detection or access locked files. The obfuscation and extensive system access strongly indicate malicious behavior, making it dangerous to use or deploy.",
