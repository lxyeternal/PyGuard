{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious payload designed to extract sensitive user data such as cookies, passwords, login information, and files from various applications and browsers, then exfiltrate this data via network requests to remote servers or webhooks.",
  "sources": "Sources include environment variables (e.g., 'LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA', 'TEMP'), local file paths (browser profiles, Chrome, Opera, Steam, Discord, wallet directories), and specific file reads (e.g., 'Login Data', 'Cookies', 'Local State', log/ldb files). The code also reads input from network requests and local system directories.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration points include network requests to remote URLs, such as 'https://webhook.wyvern.lol' and 'https://api.gofile.io', sending data in encoded or compressed formats. Data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, and files are encoded and sent via POST requests or uploaded to file-sharing services.",
  "flows": "The code collects data from browser profile directories, decodes encrypted keys, extracts stored passwords, cookies, and tokens, then encrypts or encodes this data before sending it over the network to remote servers or webhooks. Functions handle decryption, packaging, and sending data, often in multi-threaded or recursive ways.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains several suspicious behaviors: use of obfuscated variable names, malicious network activity to suspicious domains, functions that forcibly kill processes (e.g., 'taskkill'), archive and exfiltrate user data, and integration of multiple different data theft methods (browsers, wallets, gaming, messaging apps). The code also attempts to install missing modules silently and uses obfuscated or convoluted code structures. Some variable names and functions hint at malware functionalities like password and cookie theft, file stealing, and data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script exhibits multiple indicators of malicious intent. It collects sensitive user data from various sources, including browser storage, wallet files, and chat applications. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies by manipulating encrypted keys. It then compresses and uploads this data to remote servers or webhooks. Additionally, the code forcibly terminates processes, archives directories, and automates data collection in multi-threaded execution, which indicates a focus on stealth and data theft. The presence of obfuscated variables, functions that handle encryption/decryption, and network communications to suspicious URLs further supports malicious behavior. The overall structure and behavior align with typical malware or info-stealer activities aimed at covertly exfiltrating user credentials, tokens, and personal files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and demonstrates clear malicious intent. It is designed to steal sensitive user information, including passwords, cookies, tokens, and files from various applications and browsers, then exfiltrate this data to remote servers or webhooks. Its use of process termination, multi-threading, obfuscation, and network requests indicates an active effort to evade detection and maximize data theft. This code should be regarded as malware and not used in any environment.",
