  "security_risk": 1.0,

  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, exhibiting typical malware behaviors such as data exfiltration, process termination, and encryption routines, combined with significant obfuscation. The high confidence in these observations justifies assigning maximum malware and security risk scores, with a high obfuscation score reflecting the code's complexity and concealment tactics."
