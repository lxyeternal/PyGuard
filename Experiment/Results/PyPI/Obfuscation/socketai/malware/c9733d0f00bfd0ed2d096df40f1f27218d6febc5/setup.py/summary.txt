  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-confidence malicious behavior, acting as a remote code execution backdoor. The scores of malware at 1, security risk at 1, and obfuscation around 0.2-0.8 are justified. The overall risk is extremely high, and such code should be flagged and rejected in package repositories."
