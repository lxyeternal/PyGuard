{
  "purpose": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it via os.system(), which contains shell commands involving network requests and remote script execution during package installation.",
  "sources": "The base64 string in notmalfunc(), which when decoded provides shell commands; the call to notmalfunc() during the run() method of AfterInstall.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing decoded shell commands that perform network requests and run external scripts.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded to shell commands involving curl/wget to external URLs, then executed via os.system() during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate shell commands; execution of remote scripts during install; commands include network requests to external servers.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a function that decodes a base64 string into shell commands involving network requests and executes them during installation. This pattern indicates malicious intent, as it can run arbitrary remote code. The obfuscation via base64 is a common tactic to hide malicious payloads. The execution during install poses a security risk, potentially leading to system compromise. The decoded commands include fetching and executing scripts from external URLs, characteristic of supply chain attacks. The high malware score (approaching 1.0), high obfuscation score (~0.8), and high security risk (~0.9) are justified given these behaviors. The reports correctly identify these issues and assign appropriate scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing obfuscated remote scripts during package installation, representing a severe security threat. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified and consistent with the observed behavior.",
