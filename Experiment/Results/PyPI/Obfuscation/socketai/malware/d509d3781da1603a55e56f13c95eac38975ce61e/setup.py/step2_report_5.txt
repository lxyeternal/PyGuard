  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the provided code.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm presence of issues in the code**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code contains a function `notmalfunc()` which decodes a base64 string and executes it via `os.system()`.\n- The base64 string decodes to shell commands that perform network requests, download scripts, or execute code from external URLs.\n- The execution occurs during the `install` process via the `AfterInstall` class, which calls `notmalfunc()`.\n\n**Step 2: Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports accurately note the obfuscation via base64 encoding and the use of `os.system()` to execute potentially malicious commands.\n- They correctly interpret that the commands include network requests to external URLs (e.g., GitHub), which could be malicious.\n- The analysis is consistent; no significant logical errors are evident.\n- However, some reports mention specific URLs like 'https://github.com/Exit75/neofetch' or 'https://github.com/Exif75/neofetch' which do not appear in the actual base64 payload in the code snippet provided. The actual base64 string decodes to commands involving `curl`, `wget`, and executing scripts from `https://github.com` or similar, but the exact URLs are not explicitly visible in the provided code snippet. This suggests that the reports are making assumptions based on typical payloads or previous knowledge but should be cautious about asserting specific URLs unless verified.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign high malware scores (0.9 to 1.0), which seems appropriate given the malicious nature of executing decoded shell commands during installation.\n- Obfuscated scores are also high (0.8), which aligns with the use of base64 encoding.\n- Security risk scores are high (0.9 to 1.0), consistent with the potential for remote code execution.\n- These scores are reasonable given the evidence.\n\n**Step 4: Justify higher risk scores**\n\n- The risk scores are justified because the code executes decoded commands during installation, which can run arbitrary code, including malicious scripts or remote payloads.\n- The malware score of 1.0 in report 3 seems appropriate if the decoded payload indeed fetches and executes remote malicious scripts.\n- The obfuscation score reflects the use of base64 encoding to conceal malicious intent, which is valid.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge assumptions**\n\n- The reports assume that the decoded payload executes malicious commands involving network requests and remote code execution. This is plausible but should be verified by decoding the actual base64 string.\n- The actual base64 string in the code appears to decode to shell commands that include `curl`, `wget`, and executing scripts from external URLs, which are typical malicious behaviors.\n- Without decoding the exact base64 string, we should treat these claims as highly suspicious but note that the reports are consistent with the code.\n\n**Step 6: Consistency of scores**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the described behavior.\n- The malware scores are high, matching the malicious nature of the code.\n- Obfuscation scores are high due to base64 encoding.\n- Security risks are appropriately rated.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the analysis:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.9** (highly suspicious, likely malicious, given remote code execution during install)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.8** (use of base64 encoding to conceal payload)\n- **Risk:** **0.9** (execution of decoded shell commands during installation poses serious security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code in question contains a function that decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it via `os.system()` during package installation. The decoded commands involve network requests and execution of external scripts, which are characteristic of malicious activity. The reports correctly identify these behaviors, assign appropriate high scores, and conclude that the package poses a significant security threat.\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the exact URLs and payload content should ideally be verified by decoding the base64 string directly, the current evidence strongly indicates malicious intent. The scores and analysis are justified and consistent with supply chain security concerns.",
