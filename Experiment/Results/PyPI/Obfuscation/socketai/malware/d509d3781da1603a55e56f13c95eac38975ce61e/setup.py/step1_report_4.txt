{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'henter', with custom post-install behavior that executes obfuscated code.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from hardcoded base64-encoded string within 'notmalfunc()'. It also reads configuration data from the setup arguments.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'os.system()' with decoded base64 content, which runs potentially malicious shell commands.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string is decoded in 'notmalfunc()', then passed to 'os.system()' to execute shell commands during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that, when decoded, executes a series of commands, including making HTTP requests and calling other scripts. The payload appears obfuscated and potentially malicious. The use of 'os.system()' with decoded content is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports standard modules and defines a function 'b64d()' to decode base64-encoded strings. The 'notmalfunc()' function decodes an obfuscated string and executes it via 'os.system()'. This string, when decoded, executes commands that fetch code from a GitHub URL and run it, which is highly suspicious. The 'AfterInstall' class triggers 'notmalfunc()' during installation, executing the decoded payload. This pattern indicates an attempt to run malicious commands during package installation, possibly to install backdoors or malicious code. No other malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration or data theft are explicitly evident, but the obfuscation and execution of decoded payloads pose significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated payload that executes commands during package installation, indicating malicious intent. The decoded content suggests fetching and executing remote code, which is a typical malware tactic. Overall, this package poses a high security risk and should be considered malicious.",
