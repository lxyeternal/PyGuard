  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that performs additional actions after installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The 'notmalfunc' function which executes a system command decoded from a base64 string.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing decoded base64 command, which could run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Base64 string decoded by b64d() -> executed via os.system in notmalfunc() during installation or development -> potential system command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded string that, when decoded, runs a complex command involving network requests and potentially malicious actions. The code does not explicitly specify what the decoded command does, but its obfuscation and the content hint at possible malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a function 'notmalfunc' that decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it as a system command using os.system. This command appears to fetch and run code from an external URL ('https://github.com/Exif75/neofetch' and related scripts). Such behavior is suspicious, especially as it runs during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution on the user's system. No explicit credentials or backdoors are visible, but the obfuscation and external code fetching pose security risks. The code structure itself is typical for setup scripts, but the embedded decoded command is concerning due to its potential for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated behavior that executes a network-based command during package installation, indicating a high security risk. This is likely malicious or at least suspicious, as it can run arbitrary code fetched from the internet. It should be considered unsafe and further analyzed in context.",
