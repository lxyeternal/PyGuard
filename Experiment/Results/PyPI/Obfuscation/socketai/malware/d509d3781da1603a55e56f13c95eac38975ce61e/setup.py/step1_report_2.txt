{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package named 'henter'. It includes custom installation commands that execute a base64-decoded command during installation.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string within the notmalfunc() function, which is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing the decoded command, which can execute arbitrary code on the system.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded in b64d(), then passed to os.system() in notmalfunc(), leading to execution of the decoded code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate code, dynamic execution via os.system, and the inclusion of a potentially malicious payload embedded as a base64 string. The code does not specify any legitimate purpose for this encoded command.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a function b64d() that decodes a base64-encoded string. The function notmalfunc() decodes the string and executes it using os.system(), which could run arbitrary commands. The encoded string, when decoded, appears to include commands that fetch and run scripts from external URLs, which is suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. The custom classes AfterDevelop and AfterInstall extend setuptools commands, with AfterInstall executing notmalfunc() during installation, thereby executing the malicious code during package installation. The overall structure leverages obfuscation and dynamic execution to conceal malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated and dynamically executed commands that could perform malicious actions, such as executing remote scripts or payloads during package installation. The use of base64 encoding to hide the payload and execute it via os.system indicates malicious intent. This package is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
