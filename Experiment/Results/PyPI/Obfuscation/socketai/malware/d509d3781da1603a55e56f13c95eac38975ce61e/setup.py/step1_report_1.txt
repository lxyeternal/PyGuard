{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package named 'henter' with custom installation behavior, possibly to execute additional code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from a hardcoded base64-encoded string within the notmalfunc() function.",
  "sinks": "The decoded base64 string executes shell commands via os.system(), which can run arbitrary code, including potentially malicious commands.",
  "flows": "The base64-decoded string is executed during the install process in the run() method of AfterInstall class, leading to code execution during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded payload that decodes to shell commands, which include network operations and file manipulations. The code dynamically decodes and executes code during install, a suspicious behavior. Use of os.system() with decoded content is a significant concern.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines functions and classes to customize the package installation process. The core suspicious element is the notmalfunc() function, which decodes a base64 string containing obfuscated shell commands. These commands perform network requests to GitHub, execute scripts, and potentially download or execute malicious code. The code executes notmalfunc() during installation via the AfterInstall class, which runs after the standard install process. The use of base64 decoding and os.system() for executing decoded code suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activity. No other third-party library misuse or typical security flaws are evident beyond this obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated payload executed during installation that could perform malicious actions, such as executing network requests and shell commands. This indicates malicious intent and security risk, making the package potentially dangerous for supply chain security.",
