{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with some obfuscated code execution intended to run during installation.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in 'notmalfunc()' function, which is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes decoded code, potentially executing malicious or unauthorized commands.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded by 'b64d()', then passed directly to os.system() in 'notmalfunc()', leading to command execution during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded payload that is decoded at runtime and executed via os.system, which is suspicious. The payload appears to download and run scripts from external URLs, indicating potential malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration with additional obfuscated code in 'notmalfunc()' that decodes a base64-encoded string. This string, when decoded, is a shell command that downloads and executes scripts from external URLs, including 'https://github.com/Exit75/neofetch' and other potentially malicious commands. The payload executes during the 'install' phase via 'AfterInstall', which is a common tactic for malicious package supply chain attacks. The code uses 'os.system' with decoded, encoded payloads, suggesting an attempt to conceal malicious activities. Given the nature of the decoded payload, which involves downloading and executing code from external sources, this is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated malicious behavior that executes external scripts during package installation. It likely aims to perform unauthorized actions or compromise systems by downloading and executing remote code. This code should be considered malicious and unsafe to use.",
