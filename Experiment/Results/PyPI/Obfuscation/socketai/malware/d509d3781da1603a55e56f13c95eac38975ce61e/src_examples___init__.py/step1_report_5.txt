  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that imports modules and performs basic operations, possibly for utility purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading input from command-line arguments, environment variables, or file reads if present (not visible in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Data could be written to files, sent over network, or printed, but no explicit sink is observed in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow from inputs (if any) to outputs or processing functions; no explicit malicious flow detected in the visible code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code detected. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is minimal and does not contain any suspicious imports, obfuscated elements, or suspicious behavior. There is no evidence of malicious actions such as network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The code appears to be standard utility or application logic with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review of the visible code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign and typical for a utility script. However, the analysis is limited to the provided snippet, and a more comprehensive review of the full codebase is recommended for thorough security validation.",
