  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or some form of computation, but without specific context or comments, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, input() calls, or external files (if any). Specific sources cannot be confirmed due to lack of code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, database queries, network connections, or file writes, but no explicit sinks are identified without code content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through various processing steps to sinks (outputs). Due to absence of actual code, exact paths cannot be determined.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns are identifiable without code details. No signs of obfuscation are observed.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code content provided for detailed analysis. Based on available information, the code appears standard with no evident malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious data handling detected. Lack of code structure limits thorough assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not display any clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the available content. However, due to limited information, this assessment cannot be definitive. Further code details are needed for comprehensive review.",
