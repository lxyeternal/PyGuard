      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and performs system-level actions consistent with malware or sabotage. It likely contains backdoors, privilege escalation routines, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms. Given the evidence, it should be classified as malicious with a malware score of 0.95, obfuscation score of 1, and security risk score of 0.9. Deployment or trust in this code is highly dangerous and should be avoided."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low risk; however, report 5's obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns indicate high malicious potential. Slightly increasing report 4's malware and risk scores improves alignment with observed behaviors. The overall assessment remains low to moderate risk, with particular attention needed for obfuscated and dynamically executed code."
