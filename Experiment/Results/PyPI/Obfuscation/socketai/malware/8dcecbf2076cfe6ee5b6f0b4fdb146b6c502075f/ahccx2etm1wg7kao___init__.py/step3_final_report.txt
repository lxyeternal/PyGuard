  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, and dynamic execution.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, network communication, file I/O, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, data exfiltration points, environment variables, system files, logs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs feed into dynamic execution or data processing functions, potentially leading to network transmission or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, high obfuscation, suspicious patterns, lack of documentation, dynamic code snippets, inconsistent scores in reports.",
  "analysis": "The majority of reports correctly identify benign code with low malware and obfuscation scores, consistent with their descriptions. Report 4 mentions dynamic execution but assigns low malware risk, which underestimates the potential danger of eval/exec functions. Report 5 exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic code patterns, justifying high malware (0.7) and obfuscation (0.8) scores. Adjustments are recommended for report 4, increasing malware to approximately 0.7 and security risk to 0.5 to reflect the potential threat posed by eval/exec. Overall, the scores align with the described code features, with the main concern centered on report 5's suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low risk; however, report 5's obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns indicate high malicious potential. Slightly increasing report 4's malware and risk scores improves alignment with observed behaviors. The overall assessment remains low to moderate risk, with particular attention needed for obfuscated and dynamically executed code.",
