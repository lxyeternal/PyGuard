  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low risk; however, report 5's obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns indicate high malicious potential. Slightly increasing report 4's malware and risk scores improves alignment with observed behaviors. The overall assessment remains low to moderate risk, with particular attention needed for obfuscated and dynamically executed code."
