  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variables, network connections, dynamic execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file write operations, environment variable access, eval/exec calls, database queries.",
  "flows": "Data read from sources flows into processing functions, possibly reaching sinks via dynamic execution or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation (complex expressions, dynamic code), potential dynamic execution, signs of concealment, high obfuscation score in Report 3.",
  "analysis": "The code appears mostly benign across reports, with minimal or no malicious activity. Report 3 shows signs of obfuscation and potential dynamic execution, justifying moderate suspicion. Other reports are straightforward with no suspicious patterns. Malware scores are low or zero, consistent with the absence of malicious payloads. Obfuscation is only significant in Report 3. Security risk scores are low overall, with moderate concern in Report 3 due to obfuscation signs. Confidence levels are high where code is straightforward, slightly lower in Report 3 due to signs of obfuscation but no concrete malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code is generally safe with no evidence of malicious activity. Sign of obfuscation in Report 3 warrants a cautious approach but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is low, with minimal obfuscation and no malware detected.",
