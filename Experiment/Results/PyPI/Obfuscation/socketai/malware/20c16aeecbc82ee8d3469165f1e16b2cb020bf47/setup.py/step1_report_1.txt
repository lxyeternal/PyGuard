  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with a randomized package name and version.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call, which reads static strings for name, version, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all inputs are static literals.",
  "anomalies": "The package name appears randomly generated and not meaningful, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No code execution, secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward use of setuptools to define package metadata with static values. No input reading, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior observed. The package name does not reveal any malicious intent but could be indicative of obfuscation or attempt to avoid detection.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, standard setup script with an unusual package name but contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign but the random name might be suspicious in a security review context.",
