  "sources": "Function parameters 'cookie', 'username', and 'password'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; functions are empty and do not process data.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs since functions are empty.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined with obfuscated names but contain no implementation, which is unusual and could indicate hiding malicious intent or obfuscation. No actual code or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two function definitions with intentionally obscure names. Both functions are empty and do not perform any operations. The use of non-descriptive, obfuscated names combined with empty bodies could be a technique to hide malicious intent or to be placeholders for malicious code inserted later. However, in their current form, they do not perform any malicious actions or data handling. The lack of code limits the ability to determine malicious behavior or security risks. The code may be incomplete or intentionally obfuscated to hide true functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code contains obfuscated function names with no actual implementation, making it impossible to determine malicious intent from the current content. The structure suggests potential for malicious use if implemented, but as-is, it is benign. Further context or implementation is needed to assess risks.",
