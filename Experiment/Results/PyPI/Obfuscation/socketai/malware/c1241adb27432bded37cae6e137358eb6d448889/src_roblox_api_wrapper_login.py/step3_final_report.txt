  "purpose": "Placeholder functions potentially intended for handling cookies and credentials, but currently unimplemented.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'cookie', 'username', 'password' as potential data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external calls; functions are empty.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as functions contain only 'pass'.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names with no implementation; parameters suggest potential for malicious use if implemented.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two empty, obfuscated functions accepting sensitive data parameters. No active code, data processing, or external interactions are present. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The functions are placeholders, and the current code poses no security risk. The obfuscation is consistent with attempts to conceal, but without further implementation, no malicious behavior can be confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is inert with obfuscated names, possibly intended for future malicious activity but currently benign. No evidence of malware or active security vulnerabilities exists. The suspicion is solely due to obfuscation, which warrants monitoring if further code is added.",
