{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with metadata, then downloads multiple ZIP files and a package from specified URLs, extracts the ZIP files, and executes decoded base64 content from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file; downloading files via urllib.request.urlretrieve; downloading package data via urllib.request.urlopen; decoding and executing remote base64 content.",
  "sinks": "exec(base64.b64decode(...)) which executes code fetched from a remote server.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> Package setup; Downloading ZIP files and extracting -> Downloading package content -> Decoding and executing remote code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual to fetch multiple ZIP files from external sources and execute remote code without validation; no checksums or validation steps; dynamic execution of remotely fetched code; use of obscure variable names; large amount of external code fetching and execution.",
  "analysis": "The script performs package setup using standard setuptools functions, which appears normal. However, it then downloads multiple ZIP archives and a package content from URLs hosted at 'pythonanywhere.com', extracts the ZIPs, and deletes them afterward. Most notably, it fetches a package from a URL, reads the data, decodes it from base64, and executes it directly with exec(). This remote code execution is highly suspicious, as it allows arbitrary code to run on the host machine. The use of obscure variable names and lack of validation increases suspicion. The pattern of fetching and executing code remotely resembles malware behavior designed to run malicious code without user knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs benign package setup but then engages in suspicious activities by downloading, extracting, and executing remote code without validation. The remote execution component presents a significant security risk and indicates malicious intent or compromise, especially given the lack of validation and obfuscation.",
