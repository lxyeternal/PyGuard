{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package with metadata and then downloads, extracts, and executes a base64-decoded payload from remote URLs, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md'; downloading from URLs ('getcrypto', 'getpsutil', 'geturllib3', 'getrequests', 'getpackage')",
  "sinks": "exec(base64.b64decode(...)) - executing decoded remote content",
  "flows": "Read README.md -> download payloads from URLs -> extract payloads -> decode base64 payload -> execute code",
  "anomalies": "Download and extract multiple ZIP files from remote URLs, then execute a base64-decoded payload. The use of variable names with no semantic meaning, obfuscated code, and remote code execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup for a malicious supply chain attack. It downloads multiple ZIP archives from remote URLs, extracts their contents, and then retrieves a final payload from another URL, which is decoded from base64 and executed dynamically. This pattern allows for potentially malicious code to be fetched and run on the victim's system without detection. The code's obfuscation via nonsensical variable names and the use of remote code execution via 'exec' indicate malicious intent and a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This script exhibits malicious behavior, primarily by downloading and executing remote code through obfuscated and dynamic methods. It poses a significant security threat, with a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
