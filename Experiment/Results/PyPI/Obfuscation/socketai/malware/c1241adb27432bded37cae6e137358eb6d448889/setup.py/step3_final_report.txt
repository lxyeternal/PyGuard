{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package, then downloads multiple ZIP files from an untrusted domain, extracts their contents without validation, deletes the ZIP files, and finally fetches a remote payload, decodes it from base64, and executes it via exec().",
  "sources": "Open() reading README.md; urllib.request.urlretrieve() from untrusted URLs; urllib.request.urlopen() for getpackage; base64.b64decode() on fetched data.",
  "sinks": "exec() on remote, base64-decoded code.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> downloading ZIPs -> extracting and deleting ZIPs -> fetching payload from URL -> decoding payload -> executing payload.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; multiple downloads from suspicious domains; extraction without validation; remote code execution via exec().",
  "analysis": "The code performs setup operations but then engages in downloading multiple ZIP files from an untrusted domain, extracting their contents without validation, and removing the archives. It then downloads a final payload, decodes it from base64, and executes it directly with exec(). The variable names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation. The pattern of fetching, extracting, and executing remote code without validation is characteristic of malicious activity, such as supply chain attacks or backdoors. The use of exec() on remote code is highly dangerous, allowing arbitrary code execution. The code does not perform any integrity checks or validation, increasing the risk of malicious payloads executing on the host system.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, involving remote code fetching, extraction, and execution, with obfuscation and untrusted sources. The pattern aligns with supply chain malware or backdoor activity. The high malware and security risk scores are justified, and the obfuscation score reflects the nonsensical variable names. Overall, the code should be considered highly malicious and dangerous.",
