{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package and then download, extract, and execute code from remote URLs, potentially to install or run malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md', retrieving files via urllib.request.urlretrieve, fetching data with urllib.request.urlopen, reading and decoding remote data.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decoded base64 data from a remote URL, writing files to disk and then executing their contents.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> download zip files from remote URLs -> extract files -> remove zip files -> fetch remote code -> decode base64 -> execute remote code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual activity includes dynamic code execution with exec() on base64-decoded remote data, multiple downloads from suspicious URLs, no verification or validation of fetched code, obfuscated variable names, and multiple untrusted external fetches.",
  "analysis": "The code starts with package setup using setuptools, reading a README file, and configuring package metadata. It then proceeds to download multiple zip files from URLs hosted on a suspicious domain, extracts their contents, and deletes the zip files, which could be malicious payloads. Finally, it downloads an additional payload from another URL, reads its data, base64-decodes it, and executes it via exec(), which is highly dangerous. The use of obfuscated variable names and multiple external fetches with no validation indicates malicious intent and obfuscated behavior, likely designed to execute arbitrary code.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits high malicious potential, including remote code execution, obfuscation, and dynamic fetching of code for execution. It is highly suspicious and potentially harmful, designed to run malicious payloads fetched from external sources.",
