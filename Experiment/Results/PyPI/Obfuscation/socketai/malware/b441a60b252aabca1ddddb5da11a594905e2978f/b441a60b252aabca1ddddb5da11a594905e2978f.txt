      "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names and a malformed argument. No evidence of malicious behavior or security threats. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. Malware score remains 0, and overall security risk is low (~0.2). The code does not pose a security threat, and the obfuscation is superficial."

      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious intent by fetching, saving, and executing remote payloads with obfuscation and hardcoded IPs. It functions as a remote control or malware downloader, posing a high security threat. The high malware (0.9), obfuscation (0.8), and security risk (0.9) scores are justified and consistent with its behavior."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and suspicious import patterns, with potential for malicious resource deletion via 'delete'. While no explicit malicious activity is demonstrated, the pattern suggests concealment of harmful behavior. The malware risk score should be around 0.65, with high obfuscation (0.8). It is recommended to investigate the 'frequest' module and monitor for resource or data deletion if executed. Overall, the code should be treated as potentially malicious pending further analysis."
