{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; defines package metadata and dependencies; provides setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes untrusted input to external systems or performs network operations; setup parameters are static.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code primarily loads static data and calls setup() with predefined arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names and obfuscated-like variable assignments (e.g., 'eJkNQYTXzXITcqZspijQojaNsKgCEGdO', 'LFxZyfikHNdfuXXlpXpQwDiGkPCdQYfU='). These may be intentional obfuscation or just non-standard naming. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are evident. The code does not perform any runtime behavior beyond reading files and calling setup().",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules for package setup, reads a markdown file for long description, and defines various package metadata variables with non-standard, obfuscated-looking variable names. It specifies dependencies with version constraints, includes classifiers, and additional URLs. The setup() call includes typical package configuration parameters, such as name, version, license, classifiers, dependencies, and package data. No code injections, network activity, or malicious functions are present. The unusual variable names could be seen as obfuscation, but they do not execute or hide malicious intent. Overall, this appears to be a standard, albeit oddly named, setup script for packaging a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior detected. It does not perform any runtime actions beyond package setup, and there are no signs of malicious payloads or security risks.",
