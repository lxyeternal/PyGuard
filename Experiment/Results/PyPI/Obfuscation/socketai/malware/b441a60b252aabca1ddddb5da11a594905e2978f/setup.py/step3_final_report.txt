  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, a base64-like string assigned to 'long_description_content_type' which appears malformed, no dynamic code execution or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and a suspicious string that seems misplaced or obfuscated. No runtime malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, intended perhaps to conceal variable names but does not translate into malicious actions. The malformed argument ('LFxZyfikHNdfuXXlpXpQwDiGkPCdQYfU=') likely is a typo or obfuscation artifact, not malicious. All indicators point to a benign configuration script with superficial obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names and a malformed argument. No evidence of malicious behavior or security threats. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. Malware score remains 0, and overall security risk is low (~0.2). The code does not pose a security threat, and the obfuscation is superficial.",
