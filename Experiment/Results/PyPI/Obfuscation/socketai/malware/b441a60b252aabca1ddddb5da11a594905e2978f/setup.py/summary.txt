  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names and a malformed argument. No evidence of malicious behavior or security threats. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. Malware score remains 0, and overall security risk is low (~0.2). The code does not pose a security threat, and the obfuscation is superficial."
