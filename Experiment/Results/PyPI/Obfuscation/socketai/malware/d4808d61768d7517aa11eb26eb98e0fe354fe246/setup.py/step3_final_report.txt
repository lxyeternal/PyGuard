{
  "purpose": "Detects malicious behavior involving decryption and execution of embedded payloads during Windows installation, indicating potential supply chain attack or backdoor.",
  "sources": "Encrypted payload and Fernet key embedded as obfuscated strings, environment check for Windows OS.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "On Windows, code imports cryptography modules, decrypts payload with hardcoded key, then executes it via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload and key embedded directly in code, obfuscated variable names, conditional execution only on Windows, use of exec() on decrypted data.",
  "analysis": "The code decrypts a hidden payload during installation on Windows platforms and executes it dynamically, which is a classic malicious tactic. Variable names and embedded encrypted data are intentionally obfuscated to conceal intent. The pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time, especially with hardcoded secrets, strongly indicates malicious activity. The high degree of obfuscation and platform-specific behavior further support this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious characteristics consistent with supply chain backdoors or malware, executing hidden payloads during package installation. The encrypted payload, obfuscation, and dynamic execution pose a significant security risk, warranting a malware score of 0.85, obfuscation score of 0.9, and security risk score of 0.9.",
