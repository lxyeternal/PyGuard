    "The imported modules (`setuptools`, `os`) and the string variables at the top",

  "anomalies": [
    "Presence of encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed conditionally",
    "Obfuscated variable names and encrypted strings suggest concealment",
    "Use of `exec()` with decrypted code is inherently risky",
    "Encrypted data (Fernet key and ciphertext) embedded directly in code"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a setup utility for a Python package. It defines a custom install class that, on Windows systems, imports `requests` and `fernet`, then decrypts and executes a hardcoded encrypted payload. This behavior is suspicious because decrypting and executing code at install time can be malicious, especially with no transparency about the decrypted content. The encrypted strings and conditional execution pattern suggest an attempt to conceal malicious activities or backdoors. The rest of the script appears standard for a setup configuration, but the embedded decrypt-and-execute logic is a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious backdoor that decrypts and executes code during installation on Windows systems. The use of encrypted payloads, obfuscated variable names, and conditional execution of decrypted code strongly indicates malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior. This pattern warrants caution and further investigation before use.",
