{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package with obfuscated variable names, potentially to hide malicious intent, and includes a custom installation class that decrypts and executes a Fernet encrypted string during installation on Windows.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'exec' call which decrypts and executes code during installation, and the Fernet decryption key and data embedded within the code.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via 'exec', potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges during install; also includes network modules 'requests' which could be used for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The setup process invokes the custom 'install' class which decrypts and executes code at runtime, indicating a source-to-sink flow from the Fernet decryption to 'exec'.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload executed during install, the presence of network-related modules, and unusual setup configuration (e.g., key usage, custom install class) are suspicious. The decrypted payload is not visible, suggesting concealment of malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a package with a hidden class 'zALhQkcBpFrKXedQxDmVCKcIGigSvJEa' that overrides the install command. During installation on Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string with a hardcoded key, executing the resulting code via 'exec'. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, and the encrypted data is concealed, indicating an attempt to hide malicious behavior. The decryption and execution during install is a common tactic for executing malicious payloads stealthily. The presence of network modules suggests potential for data exfiltration or malicious communication. Overall, the code appears to contain malicious intent, hiding code execution behind obfuscation and encrypted payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains obfuscation, encrypted payload execution during installation, and the use of network modules, all indicative of malicious behavior. It aims to execute hidden code during package installation on Windows, which could be used for malicious activities such as backdoors, data theft, or system compromise.",
