  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that appears to automate downloading and executing a remote executable during installation.",
  "sources": "The function kbMguXvlsqJsErZYJUWgAXZRPJiDeLuQ() fetches a file from a remote URL and executes it.",
  "sinks": "The open('Cleaner.exe', 'wb').write() stores the downloaded file locally; os.system() executes it, potentially running malicious code.",
  "flows": "Code flow from importing modules to executing kbMguXvlsqJsErZYJUWgAXZRPJiDeLuQ() during package installation, leading to remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual function names, obfuscated variable names, fetching and executing an external executable during install, no checks for the downloaded content.",
  "analysis": "The script reads package metadata and then defines a function kbMguXvlsqJsErZYJUWgAXZRPJiDeLuQ() that downloads a remote executable from a suspicious URL and executes it. This function is invoked during custom install and develop commands, which means the malicious payload runs whenever the package is installed or developed. The URL used points to an executable, and the code uses requests to fetch and save this executable locally before executing it via os.system. The rest of the code appears to be standard setup boilerplate, but the critical malicious behavior is in the remote download and execution step, which can be used to install malware or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote executable during package installation, representing a high security threat. This behavior indicates an intentional backdoor or malware component embedded in the setup process.",
