{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup file for a Python package, primarily used to configure package installation and development setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description, retrieves the current username, and the current timestamp.",
  "sinks": "The function kbMguXvlsqJsErZYJUWgAXZRPJiDeLuQ() downloads an executable from an external URL and executes it, which is highly suspicious.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves reading package metadata, then during installation or development, it calls the function that downloads and runs an external executable, potentially executing malicious code during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it without any verification. The URL is hardcoded and external, which is unusual for legitimate setup scripts. The function name and variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code uses os.system to run the downloaded executable, which is risky.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to be a malicious or compromised setup script. It retrieves a URL pointing to an executable, downloads it, and then executes it during both development and installation commands. This behavior could allow malicious actors to run arbitrary code on any system installing this package. The use of obfuscated variable names and the execution of an external binary are significant red flags. The package metadata and setup configurations appear normal but are overshadowed by the malicious side effect embedded in the custom command classes.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious intent by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation or development. It is highly suspicious and could compromise systems that install this package. The package should be rejected or removed from any repository until further review and remediation.",
