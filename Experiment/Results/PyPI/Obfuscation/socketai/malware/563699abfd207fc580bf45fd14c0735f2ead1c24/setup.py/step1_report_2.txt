{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a malicious downloader and executes a remote executable during installation or development.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, obtaining user name, timestamp, and making HTTP GET request to download a file.",
  "sinks": "Writing content to 'Cleaner.exe', executing system command to run the downloaded file, and fetching external resource.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> Executing download via requests.get -> Saving as 'Cleaner.exe' -> Running 'Cleaner.exe' via os.system during install/develop commands.",
  "anomalies": "Download and execution of an external executable during package installation, use of obfuscated variable names, code directly executing a remote URL, importing requests inside a function, overwriting setup metadata with suspicious attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and third-party 'requests' inside a function, which is unusual. It downloads an executable from a remote URL and executes it during the package setup process, indicating malicious intent. Variable names are obfuscated, likely to hide malicious behavior. The setup configuration is also altered with suspicious attributes. These actions suggest the package is designed to deliver and execute malicious code during install or develop phases.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior, downloading and executing an external executable during installation, representing a security risk. The obfuscated code and remote code execution strongly indicate malicious intent.",
