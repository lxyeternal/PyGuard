{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package with custom install and develop commands that execute a function to download and run an external executable, potentially as part of malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file; retrieves the username via getpass.getuser(); accesses the current timestamp with time.time(); and within the kbMguXvlsqJsErZYJUWgAXZRPJiDeLuQ function, it fetches external data from a suspicious URL using requests.get.",
  "sinks": "The external executable 'Cleaner.exe' is downloaded and executed on the system via os.system, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or malware installation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the URL request in kbMguXvlsqJsErZYJUWgAXZRPJiDeLuQ() to file writing ('Cleaner.exe') and then to execution via os.system. User and system info are indirectly involved in the setup but are not directly used in malicious flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and executes an external file without any validation or user consent. The URL appears suspicious and the execution of an external executable during package setup is highly unusual and potentially malicious. The use of obfuscated variable names and the inclusion of code that fetches and runs a binary executable strongly indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines several variables with obfuscated names, reads from a README file, and collects system info such as username and timestamp. The core malicious component is the function kbMguXvlsqJsErZYJUWgAXZRPJiDeLuQ(), which downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it silently via os.system. This function is invoked during the custom install and develop commands, meaning any installation or development setup triggers the malicious download and execution. The URL used is a UUID-based domain, which is characteristic of malicious command-and-control servers or malware distribution points. The code's structure and the unusual variable names suggest obfuscation aimed at hiding malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious activity: it downloads and executes a potentially harmful executable during package installation or development. The suspicious URL, the silent execution, and obfuscated naming strongly suggest malicious intent and pose a significant security risk.",
