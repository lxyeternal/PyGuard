{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with some additional functions that download and execute an external file, potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package README file, gets the current user name, and the current timestamp. It also fetches external content from a URL via the 'requests' library.",
  "sinks": "The function 'kbMguXvlsqJsErZYJUWgAXZRPJiDeLuQ' downloads an executable from a remote URL and executes it using 'os.system'.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data (the URL response) is written directly to 'Cleaner.exe' and then executed. The code flows from the setup process to calling the malicious function during package installation or development setup.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a function that downloads and runs an executable from an external source during setup, which is highly suspicious. The URL used appears to be an external, possibly malicious domain. The code uses obfuscated variable names and imports 'requests' inside a function, which is uncommon in straightforward setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and sets up a typical Python package. However, it contains a function 'kbMguXvlsqJsErZYJUWgAXZRPJiDeLuQ' that downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it silently via 'os.system'. This function is invoked in custom setup commands ('develop' and 'install'), meaning the malicious payload executes during package installation or development setup. The obfuscated variable names and the use of a remote URL strongly suggest malicious intent or sabotage. The external URL points to an executable file which is then executed with elevated permissions via 'start Cleaner.exe', posing a severe security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code that downloads and executes an external executable during installation or development. The obfuscated variables and network activity indicate intentional malicious behavior, constituting a supply chain attack. The package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
