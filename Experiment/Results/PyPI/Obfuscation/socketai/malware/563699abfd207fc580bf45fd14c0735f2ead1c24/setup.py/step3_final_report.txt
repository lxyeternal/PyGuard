{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package but contains malicious behavior that downloads and executes an external executable during installation or development setup, indicating a supply chain attack.",
  "sources": "The function kbMguXvlsqJsErZYJUWgAXZRPJiDeLuQ() which uses requests.get() to fetch a remote URL and writes the content to 'Cleaner.exe'. It is invoked during custom 'develop' and 'install' commands.",
  "sinks": "The open() call writing to 'Cleaner.exe' and the os.system() call executing 'Cleaner.exe' with a command that sets an environment variable and starts the executable.",
  "flows": "Remote URL fetch via requests.get() -> write to 'Cleaner.exe' -> execute 'Cleaner.exe' via os.system() during setup commands.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, requests imported inside a function, hardcoded suspicious URL, execution of external binary during package setup, no validation of downloaded content.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it during package setup, which is a classic malicious supply chain attack. Obfuscated variable names and dynamic import of requests suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The behavior poses a severe security risk, enabling remote code execution, system compromise, or malware installation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9-1, obfuscation 0.8-0.9, risk 0.9-1) are justified given the activity. The code's actions are highly dangerous, and the high scores reflect the severity. No logical flaws are evident in the reasoning, and the behavior aligns with known malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior involving remote code download and execution during setup, representing a severe supply chain security threat. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified and should be considered as indicative of a highly malicious package.",
