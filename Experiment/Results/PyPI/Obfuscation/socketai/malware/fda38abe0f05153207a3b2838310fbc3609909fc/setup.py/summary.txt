  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscation and dynamic code execution. While practices like 'exec()' are risky and could be exploited if the version file is compromised, there is no evidence of malicious payloads or active malware. The overall security risk is low, but caution is advised, especially regarding the integrity of external files."
