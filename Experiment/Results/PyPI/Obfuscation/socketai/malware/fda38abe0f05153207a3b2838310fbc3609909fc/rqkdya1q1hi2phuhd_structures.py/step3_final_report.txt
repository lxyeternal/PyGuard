  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "The code snippets are primarily documentation or class descriptions with embedded nonsensical or corrupted text, indicating obfuscation or corruption rather than active code or data flows.",
  "sinks": "No actual data input, output, or untrusted data handling present; no sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No executable code or data flow paths are detectable; the snippets are static descriptions with no runtime behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation or corruption evidenced by nonsensical strings, inconsistent formatting, and lack of executable logic. No malicious code or payloads are observed.",
  "analysis": "All reports identify the code as heavily obfuscated or corrupted documentation, lacking executable logic or data flows. Malware scores are correctly set to zero, and obfuscation scores are high (~0.7-0.8), justified by the corruption. Security risks are minimal due to absence of active code or vulnerabilities. The anomalies are artifacts of obfuscation or formatting issues, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, primarily corrupted documentation with no evidence of malicious behavior or active security threats. The high obfuscation scores reflect the corruption, but overall, the supply chain security posture is safe.",
