  "purpose": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. It likely performs standard data processing or utility functions without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Any input functions, environment variable reads, or data file reads (not explicitly shown but assumed from context).",
  "sinks": "Potential data output points, network communication functions, or file writes (not explicitly shown but considered in analysis).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs), with no suspicious intermediate processing detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. No suspicious network activity or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The provided summaries indicate no malicious indicators, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign assessments. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the limited but clear evidence of benign behavior. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present based on the descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no detectable malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the assessments are consistent and justified.",
