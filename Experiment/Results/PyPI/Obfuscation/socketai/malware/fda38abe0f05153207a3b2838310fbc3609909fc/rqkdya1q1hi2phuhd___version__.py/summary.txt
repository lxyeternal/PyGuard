  "conclusion": "Based on the summaries, there is no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. The current scores are appropriate, with the exception of slightly overconfident assessment in Report 3. Adjusting Report 3's confidence downward improves consistency. Overall, the dependency appears benign given the available data."
