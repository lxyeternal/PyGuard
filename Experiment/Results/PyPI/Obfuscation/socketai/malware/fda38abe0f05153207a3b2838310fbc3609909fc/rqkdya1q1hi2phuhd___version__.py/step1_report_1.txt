  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple utility or script performing some data processing or communication tasks, but without the actual code provided, this cannot be confirmed.",
  "sources": "Input sources could include environment variables, user input functions, network data, or file reads. Specific sources cannot be identified without code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, system commands, or data outputs. No specific sinks can be identified without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through various functions or modules. Without the code, exact paths cannot be traced.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without examining the code. Look for hardcoded secrets, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code, which are not provided here.",
  "analysis": "Since the actual code is not provided, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Normally, this would involve checking for hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, insecure data handling, or obfuscated code segments.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to determine malicious behavior or security issues due to lack of provided code. No apparent malicious intent or anomalies can be assessed without code context.",
