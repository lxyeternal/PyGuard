  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and malicious potential of the open source dependency based on provided code summaries.",
  "sources": "No code provided; analysis based on summaries and descriptions.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; no untrusted data sources or sinks identified due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no source-to-sink flows can be determined without code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code prevents detection of anomalies; no suspicious imports, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "All reports acknowledge the lack of actual code, leading to low confidence in detecting malicious behavior. Reports 1, 2, 4, and 5 correctly assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, reflecting no evidence. Report 3 suggests potential concerns but lacks concrete evidence; it assigns a higher confidence (0.7) and a low security risk (0.2). Given the absence of code, this confidence is overstated; it should be lowered to around 0.3–0.4 to better match the uncertainty. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the available information, with minor adjustments to confidence in Report 3 for accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the summaries, there is no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. The current scores are appropriate, with the exception of slightly overconfident assessment in Report 3. Adjusting Report 3's confidence downward improves consistency. Overall, the dependency appears benign given the available data.",
