  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated, complex HTTP request/response utility that does not show signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but static analysis indicates a low likelihood of malware. The current scores are appropriate; further dynamic or runtime analysis could provide additional assurance."
