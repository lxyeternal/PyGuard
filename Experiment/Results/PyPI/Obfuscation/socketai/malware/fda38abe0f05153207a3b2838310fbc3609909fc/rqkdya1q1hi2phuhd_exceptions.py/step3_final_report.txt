  "purpose": "Analysis of embedded obfuscated strings within documentation comments referencing requests.exceptions to determine potential malicious activity or security risks.",
  "sources": "Embedded random strings within comments or docstrings, specifically within references to requests.exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No actual data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code contains only documentation comments.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as there is no executable code; embedded strings are isolated within comments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of nonsensical, obfuscated strings such as 'SwQcclPVzuobvmpxHgzhFrgrlQFrUnng' and 'GSEUmVjNTmgvOZGZEMgOTWcrNsLRpYbE' embedded within comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of documentation or comments referencing requests.exceptions, with embedded random strings that appear to be obfuscation or placeholder text. No executable code, data processing, or network activity is present. The embedded strings are suspicious but do not constitute active malicious code. Malware scores are appropriately zero; obfuscation scores are high (~0.7), reflecting suspicion. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), consistent with benign documentation but warranting caution due to obfuscation. Overall, the anomalies are likely benign obfuscation or placeholder text, with no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign documentation with embedded obfuscated strings. No active malware or malicious behavior is detected. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware score remains at 0. The overall security risk is low. Continued vigilance is recommended if similar patterns are observed elsewhere.",
