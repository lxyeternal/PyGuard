  "conclusion": "The code is benign documentation with embedded obfuscated strings. No active malware or malicious behavior is detected. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware score remains at 0. The overall security risk is low. Continued vigilance is recommended if similar patterns are observed elsewhere."
