      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscation and dynamic code execution. While practices like 'exec()' are risky and could be exploited if the version file is compromised, there is no evidence of malicious payloads or active malware. The overall security risk is low, but caution is advised, especially regarding the integrity of external files."

The anomalies are benign artifacts, not indicators of obfuscation or malicious activity. The overall security risk is negligible."

The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware score remains at 0. The overall security risk is low. Continued vigilance is recommended if similar patterns are observed elsewhere."

The high obfuscation warrants caution, but static analysis indicates a low likelihood of malware. The current scores are appropriate; further dynamic or runtime analysis could provide additional assurance."

However, no explicit malicious actions are demonstrated in this snippet. The high obfuscation warrants caution, and further analysis of the full package is recommended before deployment. The malware score should be set around 0.6 to reflect suspicion without definitive evidence."

The current scores are appropriate, with the exception of slightly overconfident assessment in Report 3. Adjusting Report 3's confidence downward improves consistency. Overall, the dependency appears benign given the available data."
