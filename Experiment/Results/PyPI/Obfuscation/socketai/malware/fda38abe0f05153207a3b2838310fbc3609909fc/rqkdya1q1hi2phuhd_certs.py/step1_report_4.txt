{
  "purpose": "Provides information about the default CA certificate bundle used by the requests library, specifically referencing the certifi package.",
  "sources": "requests.certs",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Contains an incomplete or malformed comment and a string 'requests.certs' that appears disconnected from functional code; lacks executable logic or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a comment describing the CA bundle and a single line 'requests.certs' that is syntactically invalid or incomplete. There are no functions, variable definitions, or executable statements. The 'requests.certs' line seems to reference the requests library's certificates module but does not perform any action. The comment mentions modifying 'where()' to change CA bundle location but provides no actual implementation or code logic. Overall, this appears to be an incomplete or fragmentary snippet with no operational code or data flow.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is non-functional, consisting mainly of a malformed comment and an isolated identifier. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data handling, or security risks. It appears to be an incomplete or placeholder snippet without executable logic.",
