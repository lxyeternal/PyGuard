  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script intended for data processing or automation tasks. Without additional context, its specific purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs include command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files/read operations (if present).",
  "sinks": "Possible sinks involve network connections, file writes, or system commands executed with subprocess or os modules.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment to sinks like network or file outputs, possibly through intermediate processing.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Unusual patterns include dynamic code execution or suspicious imports, if any.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for suspicious patterns including hardcoded secrets, network communications, or code that could perform malicious actions. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage was found based on the provided code snippet. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard, with no indications of hidden or malicious intent. The structure and formatting are typical of legitimate scripts. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads were identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard script, likely intended for legitimate data processing. No malicious or suspicious activity was detected based on the current analysis.",
