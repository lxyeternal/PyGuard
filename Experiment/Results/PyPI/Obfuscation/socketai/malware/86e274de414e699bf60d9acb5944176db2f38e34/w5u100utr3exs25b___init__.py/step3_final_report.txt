  "purpose": "Analysis of Python package code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on supply chain threats.",
  "sources": "Environment variable reads, subprocess/network calls, data processing functions, dynamic code execution points, potential obfuscation layers.",
  "sinks": "Network communication (data exfiltration), environment variable access, subprocess execution, dynamic code evaluation, data handling points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs flow into subprocesses, dynamic code execution, or data processing functions, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation (e.g., complex constructs, dynamic code), signs of data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, unusual network activity, hardcoded suspicious patterns, inconsistent code complexity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits varying levels of obfuscation and suspicious activity across the reports. Report 4 shows significant signs of malicious behavior, including obfuscation and data exfiltration, justifying high malware (0.6) and obfuscation (0.8) scores. Reports 1, 2, 3, and 5 demonstrate benign or low-risk patterns, with scores appropriately low or zero. The confidence levels align with the described behaviors. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with no need for major adjustments. Slightly increasing the malware score in Report 4 to 0.65 and the overall risk to 0.6 could better reflect the suspicion, but current scores are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates that only Report 4 warrants significant concern, with high suspicion of malicious activity justified by the described obfuscation and exfiltration signs. Other reports are benign or low risk. The current scoring system is consistent and appropriate, with no major revisions necessary.",
