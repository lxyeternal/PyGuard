  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, but the exact intent is unclear due to minimal context.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from standard input, files, or environment variables; specific sources are not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution functions, but no explicit dangerous functions are present in the code provided.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources to processing functions and potentially to output or system calls; however, no explicit malicious flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated segments. Usage of dynamic execution or dangerous libraries is absent.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with clear structure and no signs of obfuscated or malicious code segments. It does not demonstrate suspicious data flows, unusual code patterns, or malicious behaviors. It appears to be a benign utility or data processing script, although limited context prevents complete certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code seems safe and aligned with typical open-source utility functions.",
