  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates that only Report 4 warrants significant concern, with high suspicion of malicious activity justified by the described obfuscation and exfiltration signs. Other reports are benign or low risk. The current scoring system is consistent and appropriate, with no major revisions necessary."
