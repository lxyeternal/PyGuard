{
  "purpose": "A simple function returning a greeting string, likely intended for demonstration or basic testing.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as no input or output beyond the return statement exists.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which may suggest attempts to hide intent, but the code itself is trivial.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with an obfuscated name that returns a static string. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network calls, and no sensitive operations. The simplicity and obfuscated name raise minimal suspicion but do not indicate malicious intent. No security risks or malware behaviors are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a simple greeting, and does not contain malicious behavior. The obfuscated function name alone is not suspicious in this context but suggests minimal obfuscation without malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
