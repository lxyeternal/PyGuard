{
  "purpose": "Custom installation script that appears to perform network requests and system modifications during package installation.",
  "sources": "Requests made via subprocess commands using os.system with URLs and environment variables; environment variables like EL_FAAS_PORT_9000_TCP_ADDR and EL_FAAS_SERVICE_HOST are used as data sources.",
  "sinks": "Execution of os.system commands that run dynamic Python code with potentially untrusted data; network requests that download content into LICENSE file; creation of a file (/tmp/pytest2); environment variables used in network requests.",
  "flows": "Sources include environment variables and URLs, which are used to build commands executed via os.system. These commands download or access remote resources, and potentially write output to files or execute code.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated class and method names; dynamically constructs commands to run Python code that performs network requests; repeatedly installs 'requests' package; writes responses directly into LICENSE file; modifies environment variables and touches files in /tmp. There are multiple try-except blocks that suppress exceptions, hiding potential errors.",
  "analysis": "The code is obfuscated with unclear class and method names. It performs network requests to specified URLs and environment variables, potentially retrieving malicious payloads. It then writes responses into the LICENSE file, which could be used to exfiltrate data or execute malicious content. The repeated installation of 'requests' and the dynamic construction of Python commands indicate an attempt to download and execute remote code or data. Usage of os.system with concatenated strings and environment variables can lead to command injection if the environment is compromised. The creation of a temporary file (/tmp/pytest2) may serve as a marker or trigger. The overall behavior suggests an embedded mechanism for remote data retrieval or execution, which is suspicious and could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscated and suspicious network activity during package installation, including fetching data from remote URLs, writing to files, and executing dynamic code. These behaviors align with malicious intent such as data exfiltration or remote code execution. The package could be used to compromise systems during installation, representing a security risk.",
