{
  "purpose": "Custom setup script that installs dependencies and executes several HTTP requests to external servers during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (EL_FAAS_PORT_9000_TCP_ADDR, EL_FAAS_SERVICE_HOST), hardcoded URLs and headers, importing 'requests' library.",
  "sinks": "Executing system commands via os.system, including network requests and file operations (touch /tmp/pytest2).",
  "flows": "Environment variables and hardcoded URLs flow into system commands that perform HTTP GET requests, potentially sending data externally. The script installs 'requests' and executes code based on responses, which could lead to external communication or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, multiple repeated system commands, multiple try-except blocks with minimal error handling, writing to LICENSE file, installing 'requests' dynamically, and executing network requests during setup. The use of hardcoded URLs and proxy authorization headers is suspicious. The script executes external requests and touches system files during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that performs multiple network requests to external servers during package setup. URLs and headers are hardcoded, with obfuscated class and function names, indicating possible attempts to hide malicious intent. The script installs 'requests' dynamically, then uses it to make GET requests to URLs composed of environment variables and hardcoded strings, often with proxy authorization headers. It writes responses directly to a LICENSE file and touches a temporary file, which could be used for persistence or tracking. The repeated patterns and obfuscated code, combined with network communication during install, suggest potential malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or remote command execution.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits suspicious behavior including dynamic code execution, external network requests during installation, obfuscated code structure, and potential data exfiltration mechanisms. These factors indicate a high likelihood of malicious intent and pose security risks if used in a package. The code should be considered malicious or compromised.",
