  "purpose": "Custom installation script for a Python package that performs network requests and system modifications during setup.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs ('https://chef.csa.eyrie.cloud/chef/validation.pem' and dynamic URLs constructed from environment variables 'EL_FAAS_PORT_9000_TCP_ADDR' and 'EL_FAAS_SERVICE_HOST'), environment variables, and execution of system commands.",
  "sinks": "os.system calls executing requests, touching files, and running arbitrary commands. Requests retrieved from URLs and environment variables are used in system commands and requests modules, which could be manipulated.",
  "flows": "Source URLs and environment variables are fetched, then their data is used to construct system commands and HTTP requests, which are executed via os.system or the requests module, potentially leading to data leakage or remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name and method names, multiple repeated code blocks, usage of os.system with dynamically constructed commands, network activity during package setup, touching a file in /tmp, and silent exception handling. The code performs network requests and system modifications during setup, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that overrides the install command to perform several network requests to external URLs and URLs constructed from environment variables, with custom headers including proxy authorization. These requests are executed via Python commands spawned through os.system, which can retrieve and potentially execute malicious content. There are multiple repeated blocks for similar requests, some with allow_redirects set. The script also touches a file in /tmp, possibly as a marker or trigger. Exception handling is broad, hiding errors. The class and method names are obfuscated, and the code’s purpose appears to be to perform network communications and file operations during installation, potentially malicious or backdoor-like in nature. The code does not perform any obvious benign task beyond installing requests and executing commands, with no clear legitimate purpose for the network activity during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior typical of malicious code, including obfuscated names, network requests to external and environment-based URLs, executing commands with dynamically constructed strings, and silent exception handling. This indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, possibly to establish backdoors or exfiltrate data during package installation.",
