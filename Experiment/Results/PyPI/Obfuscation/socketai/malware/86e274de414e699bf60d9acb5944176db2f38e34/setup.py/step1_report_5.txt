  "purpose": "Custom installation script that performs network requests and modifies system state during package installation.",
  "sources": "User environment variables (EL_FAAS_PORT_9000_TCP_ADDR, EL_FAAS_SERVICE_HOST), hardcoded URL 'https://chef.csa.eyrie.cloud/chef/validation.pem'.",
  "sinks": "os.system calls executing arbitrary commands, including requests to external URLs, touching files, and installing packages.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and hardcoded URL are used to construct network requests executed via os.system, potentially exfiltrating data or executing malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, repeated and complex request commands, execution of arbitrary commands via os.system, writing to LICENSE file, touching system files, and installing requests package dynamically. These behaviors are suspicious and indicative of potentially malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class with obfuscated naming. It attempts to perform multiple network requests to external URLs, including a hardcoded URL and URLs constructed from environment variables, using Python requests via system commands. It installs the 'requests' library dynamically, then uses os.system to execute network requests that write responses or status codes to a file named LICENSE. It also attempts to touch a system file (/tmp/pytest2). The obfuscation, external network access, and system modifications suggest potential malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or system sabotage. The repeated code blocks and complex string concatenations further indicate obfuscation aimed at hiding malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits several suspicious behaviors including obfuscated naming, dynamic code execution via os.system, external network requests to potentially malicious or controlled domains, and system modifications. These factors point toward likely malicious intent or malicious behavior embedded within the package installation process.",
