  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to its use of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered conditionally. The behavior aligns with typical malware techniques, warranting a high malware score. The setup code appears standard but is overshadowed by the malicious activity. Overall, the script should be treated as malicious, and further analysis of the payload is recommended."
