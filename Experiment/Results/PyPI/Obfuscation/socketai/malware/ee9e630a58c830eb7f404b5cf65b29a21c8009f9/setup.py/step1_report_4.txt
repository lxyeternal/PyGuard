{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package, but also includes potentially malicious behavior involving executing encoded PowerShell commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existence of a file named 'tahg' and attempts to execute a base64-encoded PowerShell command if the file does not exist.",
  "sinks": "The encoded PowerShell command is executed via subprocess.Popen, which can be a sink for malicious code, especially as it involves hidden window execution and encoded commands.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg' existence -> If not present, executes encoded PowerShell command -> Potentially malicious actions occur within the PowerShell execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an encoded PowerShell command that runs with hidden window style, no apparent reason for this behavior within a setup script. The command is base64-encoded, which is suspicious as it obfuscates its true intent. The setup process itself is standard, but the conditional execution of hidden encoded commands is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to run a base64-encoded PowerShell command when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded string decodes to a PowerShell script that is hidden from the user interface. The execution of such an encoded command in a setup script is suspicious, as it could be used to perform malicious actions stealthily. The code surrounding the setup function appears standard, but the conditional execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands indicates potentially malicious intent. The rest of the code is typical for a setup script, with no other suspicious or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious encoded PowerShell command executed conditionally, which could be malicious. The setup process itself appears normal, but the inclusion of hidden, obfuscated code indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior. This warrants further investigation before use.",
