  "purpose": "The code executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command during setup if the file 'tahg' does not exist, with obfuscation and hidden execution, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The check for 'tahg' existence; the subprocess.Popen call executing the encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the encoded PowerShell command; silent error handling conceals failures.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check -> conditional execution -> subprocess runs encoded command -> command executes silently with hidden window.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently during setup; silent exception handling; obfuscated payload; conditional execution based on file presence.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a filesystem check for 'tahg' and, if absent, runs a subprocess executing an obfuscated PowerShell command encoded in base64 with hidden window flags. The setup() call is wrapped in try-except that suppresses errors. The execution of an encoded, hidden command during setup is suspicious and typical of malicious activity. The silent error handling prevents detection of failures. The high obfuscation and execution context strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially allowing remote code execution or backdoor installation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, obfuscated ~0.9, risk ~0.9) are consistent with this behavior. Decoding the command would clarify its purpose, but current evidence indicates high suspicion of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code's execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup, combined with silent error handling and conditional logic, strongly indicates malicious intent. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified and should be treated with high suspicion.",
