  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with embedded potentially malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads file existence ('tahg'), executes a subprocess with a PowerShell encoded command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of a PowerShell encoded command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "flows": "Checks if 'tahg' exists -> executes PowerShell encoded command if it doesn't.",
  "anomalies": "Use of PowerShell encoded command, silent subprocess execution, lack of visible output or control.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing setup and attempting to import subprocess and os modules. It then checks for the existence of the file 'tahg'. If not found, it executes a subprocess that runs a PowerShell command encoded in Base64. The command is obfuscated and likely designed to run malicious code covertly. The setup function is called with minimal metadata, wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors. The encoded PowerShell string decodes to a command that could perform harmful actions, such as downloading or executing additional malicious payloads. The use of 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' and silent execution further indicates an attempt to hide activity. Overall, the code is intended to execute hidden commands based on a specific file check, suggesting malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains suspicious behavior—hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell command triggered by the absence of a specific file. This indicates malicious intent, likely for establishing backdoors or downloading malicious payloads without user knowledge.",
