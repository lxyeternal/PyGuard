      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior indicative of malicious activity, primarily through the silent execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup. While the exact payload remains unknown without decoding, the pattern strongly suggests malicious intent. The high obfuscation, stealth, and potential for remote code execution justify high malware and risk scores. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended for definitive confirmation, but current evidence warrants treating this package as highly suspicious."
