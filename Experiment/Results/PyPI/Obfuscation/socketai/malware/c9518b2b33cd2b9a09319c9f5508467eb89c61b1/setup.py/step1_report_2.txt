{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup command for the 'setuptools' package, which collects system information and sends it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "Data is collected from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "Requests module's GET request to 'http://9.30.214.68:9090' with system info as parameters.",
  "flows": "The code gathers hostname, current working directory, and username; then sends this data to an external server via HTTP GET request during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes obfuscated class and method names, and collects and transmits system information without user consent or transparency. The server IP is suspicious, and the data transmission occurs during installation, which is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a class inheriting from 'install'. In the overridden method, it collects hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this information to a hardcoded IP address via a GET request, likely for tracking or malicious purposes. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide behavior. The transmission occurs during package setup, which could be used for unauthorized surveillance or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system info and transmitting it to an external IP during package installation, likely for tracking or spying purposes. The obfuscation and context are suspicious, indicating potential malware activity.",
