{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation class for setuptools that collects system information and sends it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via an HTTP GET request to an external IP address (http://9.30.214.68:9090).",
  "flows": "Collects hostname, current working directory, and username -> Sends this data in a GET request to an external server during setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses non-descriptive, obfuscated class and method names, and performs data exfiltration during package installation without user consent or notification.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for system info collection and HTTP requests. It defines a subclass of 'install' that overrides the 'run' method (named DFJZegQRAhqnpZqGwDzNerKMMqTOaqoJ). In this method, it gathers hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data to an external server. This behavior is hidden within the setup process, indicating potential malicious intent to exfiltrate system data without explicit user permission. The use of obfuscated names and unsolicited data transmission strongly suggests malicious or tracking behavior. The setup parameters appear normal but are used as a cover for the malicious code execution during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation to a remote server, likely for tracking or unauthorized surveillance. The obfuscation and covert data sending are suspicious, indicating this package may be malicious.",
