  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that performs an HTTP request during installation.",
  "sources": "Code reads hostname, current working directory, and username; makes an HTTP GET request to a remote server with this data.",
  "sinks": "Requests library makes a GET request to an external server with sensitive system information as parameters.",
  "flows": "System information (hostname, cwd, username) is collected and sent via requests.get to a remote server during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Code collects environment and system info and transmits it without user consent or notification, which is suspicious. The IP address used for the request is in a private/unsuspicious range, but the action is hidden within the setup script. The class and method names are obfuscated, indicating possible malicious intent. No code comments or documentation explaining this behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script redefines the install command for setup, adding behavior to collect system info (hostname, current directory, username). It then makes a GET request to a specified IP address, passing the collected info as parameters. This behavior is unusual for a legitimate setup script, which typically only installs packages. The data transmission appears covert, with no user notification or consent. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide malicious behavior. While technically the data sent is basic system info, the pattern of data collection and transmission during installation is characteristic of malicious activity or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits potentially malicious behavior by secretly collecting system information and transmitting it to a remote server during package installation. This is suspicious and should be treated as a security concern, indicating possible data exfiltration or tracking activity.",
