{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to a remote IP address, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call transmitting data to external IP",
  "flows": "source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> requests.get() with parameters",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; data exfiltration during setup; network request to suspicious IP; no user notification or consent",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated install class that overrides the installation process to collect system info and send it to an external server during package setup. The obfuscation and covert data transmission are suspicious and indicative of malicious intent. The network activity occurs without user awareness, and the remote IP is suspicious. The behavior aligns with supply chain attacks or malware designed to exfiltrate data surreptitiously. The high obfuscation, data exfiltration, and network activity justify high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by covertly collecting and transmitting system information during installation, with obfuscation to hide intent. The activity is highly suspicious and potentially harmful, warranting classification as malicious.",
