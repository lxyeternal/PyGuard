{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package, but it includes potentially malicious behavior involving data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() - these are sources of system information; requests.get() with external URL is a network sink.",
  "targets": "The request to 'http://9.30.214.68:9090' sends system data collected from sources, indicating data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, cwd, username) collected from sources → sent via requests.get() to external IP address.",
  "anomalies": "The code defines a class with an obfuscated name and method, which is unusual. It performs a network request during package setup, which is suspicious behavior. The URL and data collection are hidden behind minimal variable names.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the setuptools installation process to include a network request that transmits system information to an external server during installation. It collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then exfiltrates this data without user consent. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The URL used is an IP address, often indicative of suspicious or malicious command-and-control servers. The code is minimal but clearly performs data collection and exfiltration during package setup, a common tactic for malicious supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by collecting system information and exfiltrating it during package installation. The obfuscation and network activity raise significant security concerns. This package should be considered malicious or compromised.",
