{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom setup installation process that collects system information and sends it to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hostname via socket.gethostname(), current working directory via os.getcwd(), and username via getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The collected data is sent via an HTTP GET request to an external IP address ('http://9.30.214.68:9090').",
  "flows": "Data from hostname, cwd, and username are gathered and sent to the remote server through requests.get() during the custom install process.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to conceal functionality. The code transmits system info without user consent or clear purpose, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard setup process with a custom install command. During installation, it collects hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this info to a remote server via an HTTP request. The use of obfuscated names and network activity during installation are suspicious and indicative of potentially malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or device fingerprinting without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious intent by secretly collecting and transmitting system information during package installation. The obfuscation and network activity are typical of malicious supply chain behavior. It warrants a high security risk score and cautious handling.",
