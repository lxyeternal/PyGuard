{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom setup script for a Python package that, upon installation, gathers system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' with system information as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "The data collected from hostname, cwd, and username flows directly into the request parameters sent to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom install command to perform network activity during package installation. The external URL appears suspicious, likely for tracking or data exfiltration. The code does not appear to serve a legitimate purpose within typical package installation workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of the install command that, during the installation process, gathers hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external, potentially malicious server. This behavior is unusual for a standard setup script and indicates possible malicious intent, such as tracking or data collection without user consent. No other malicious or suspicious code patterns, such as backdoors, credential theft, or obfuscated code, are present. The external request is performed as part of the installation process, which is a common technique for covert data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external server during package installation. This is suspicious and likely malicious, indicating possible abuse of the package installation process for tracking or reconnaissance. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered unsafe for use.",
