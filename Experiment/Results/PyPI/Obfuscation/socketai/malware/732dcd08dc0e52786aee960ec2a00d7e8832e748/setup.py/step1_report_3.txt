{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom setup command for Python package installation that collects system information and sends it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() - gathering hostname, current working directory, and username",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call that sends collected data to an external URL (http://5r13v9.ceye.io)",
  "flows": "Data collected from hostname, current working directory, and username flows into the requests.get() URL as parameters, potentially exfiltrating user environment info",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names, data exfiltration during package installation, sending data to a suspicious domain ceye.io, which is often used for C2 or data collection in security contexts",
  "analysis": "The code extends the setuptools install command to include a step where system information is gathered and sent to an external server. The variables are obfuscated, likely to hide malicious intent. The data collection includes hostname, current working directory, and username, which are transmitted during package installation, potentially without user consent. The external server ceye.io is known in security communities for data collection or command-and-control activities. No other suspicious or malicious code is present, but the data exfiltration behavior during install is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to intentionally collect system information during package installation and exfiltrate it to an external server. The obfuscation and nature of the data collection point toward malicious intent or at least malicious behavior. This is a security risk, as it can leak user information without consent.",
