{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup command that, during installation, collects system information (hostname, current directory, username) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external server, likely for data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with external URL 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' and parameters containing system info",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are gathered in the custom install class method and sent directly to the external server via requests.get() during package installation",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; data exfiltration during setup; use of suspicious external domain (ceye.io); network activity triggered during installation process",
  "analysis": "The code introduces a custom install command that, when executed, collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then transmits this data to an external server. The obfuscated naming and use of a known monitoring domain suggest malicious intent. The behavior is atypical for standard setup scripts and indicates covert data collection. The external URL is associated with testing and monitoring, often exploited for malicious tracking. The code does not perform destructive actions but exfiltrates user/system data without consent, which is a security concern. The obfuscation further indicates an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75-0.9, security risk ~0.8-0.9, obfuscation ~0.7-0.8) are justified given the behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly collecting and transmitting system information during package installation. The obfuscation and use of a suspicious external domain support this assessment. The behavior constitutes a high security risk and should be flagged as malicious or highly suspicious, warranting removal from supply chains and further review.",
