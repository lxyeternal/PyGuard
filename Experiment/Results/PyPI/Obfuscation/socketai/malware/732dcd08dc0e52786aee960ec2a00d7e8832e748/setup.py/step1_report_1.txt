{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, including a custom install command.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected system information via an HTTP GET request to an external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io).",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom install command collects system data and transmits it to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends system data (hostname, cwd, username) to a suspicious external URL without user consent or obvious purpose; the URL looks like a monitoring or testing domain. The class name and setup parameters are obfuscated or nonsensical, which can be suspicious. Use of requests in a setup script for data exfiltration is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the setuptools install command to include a step that gathers system information. It then makes an HTTP GET request to an external server with this data as parameters. No input validation or user confirmation is performed. The external URL appears suspicious and may be used for tracking or exfiltration. The overall pattern suggests covert data collection during package installation, which is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly collecting and transmitting system information to an external domain during installation. The obfuscated class name and unusual data transmission are signs of potentially malicious intent. This code could be part of a supply chain attack or unauthorized data exfiltration.",
