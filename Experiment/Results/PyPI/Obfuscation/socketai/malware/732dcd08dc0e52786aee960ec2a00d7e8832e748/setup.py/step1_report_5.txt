  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom install command.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), requests.get() with external URL",
  "sinks": "requests.get() sending data to external URL",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, cwd, username) -> requests.get() to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Code collects system information and sends it to an external server during installation; use of non-descriptive class and variable names; no validation or filtering of data before sending",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, during package installation, gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via a GET request to a suspicious external URL (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This behavior resembles tracking or data exfiltration. The use of non-standard, obfuscated class and variable names suggests an attempt to conceal intent. No other malicious activities such as code execution or data theft are directly present, but the external data transmission without user consent is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and exfiltration during package installation, which could be malicious or at least privacy-invasive. It does not appear to be a standard setup script and includes potentially malicious behavior intended to track or spy on users without their knowledge.",
