{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that performs custom actions during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hostname, current working directory, and username using socket, os, and getpass modules.",
  "sinks": "Data collected (hostname, cwd, username) is sent via an HTTP GET request to an external domain 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io'.",
  "flows": "Data collected from the system flows from variable assignment to the requests.get call, which transmits the data to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits system information to an external domain during installation without any user consent or obvious purpose. The domain 'ceye.io' is known for DNS logging/testing, often used for tracking or malicious purposes. The function and class names are obfuscated and do not describe their purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and a third-party library (requests). It defines a custom install command that, when executed, gathers system info and sends it to an external server. This behavior occurs during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The data transmission could be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or malicious surveillance. No other malicious code, backdoors, or credential theft mechanisms are present. The obfuscated naming and external data exfiltration are suspicious. Overall, the code's behavior indicates potential malicious intent, primarily data exfiltration during package install.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign function of package setup but includes suspicious behavior by exfiltrating system data to an external domain during installation. This is indicative of malicious activity or spyware-like behavior, warranting caution.",
