      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly collecting and transmitting system information during package installation. The obfuscation and use of a suspicious external domain support this assessment. The behavior constitutes a high security risk and should be flagged as malicious or highly suspicious, warranting removal from supply chains and further review."
