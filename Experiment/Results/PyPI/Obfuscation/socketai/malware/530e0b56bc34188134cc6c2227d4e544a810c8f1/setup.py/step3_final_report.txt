{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup command that, during installation, collects system hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external suspicious URL, indicating potential data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call sending data to external URL",
  "flows": "source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> data assembled into params -> requests.get() to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, silent data exfiltration during setup, sending data to suspicious external URL without user consent",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert collection of system info during package installation and transmits it to an external server, indicating malicious intent. Obfuscation of class and method names suggests an attempt to hide this behavior. The external URL is suspicious and not a standard registry or analytics endpoint. No benign purpose justifies this activity. The behavior aligns with supply chain attacks aiming at data theft or privacy invasion. The high obfuscation and external data transfer during setup are strong indicators of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during installation, with obfuscated code and suspicious external URL. This constitutes a high security risk and malware potential, warranting a malware score of 0.85, obfuscation score of 0.8, and risk score of 0.9.",
