  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that executes additional code during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), requests.get() with system info as parameters.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to an external URL, which transmits system information.",
  "flows": "The system information collected (hostname, cwd, username) flows from sources to the requests.get() call, which sends data to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Code collects system info and transmits it without user consent or clear purpose, using obfuscated variable names. No validation or user interaction is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, when invoked, gathers system details: hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL. The URL is non-descriptive and potentially malicious. This behavior resembles data exfiltration during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The obfuscated class and variable names further suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent. No other malicious behaviors like file operations or privilege escalation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes code that collects system information during installation and transmits it to an external, suspicious URL without user consent, indicating malicious intent. The obfuscation and data exfiltration behavior warrant a high security concern.",
