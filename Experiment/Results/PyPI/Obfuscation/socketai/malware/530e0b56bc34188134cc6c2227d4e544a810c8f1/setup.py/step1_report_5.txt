  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and send it to a remote server.",

  "sinks": "requests.get() with remote URL and parameters containing system info",
  "flows": "Information gathered from hostname, current working directory, and username flows into parameters of requests.get() which sends data to external server",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names, sending system data to a suspicious external endpoint without user consent, hidden data transmission",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command class inheriting from setuptools' install. During installation, it collects hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a remote URL. The class and method names are obfuscated, which is suspicious and often indicative of malicious intent or attempts to hide behavior. The data exfiltration occurs during the install process, which is a common tactic for malicious packages to steal information without explicit user awareness. No other malicious code such as code execution, backdoors, or data theft beyond information leakage is evident. The package setup only includes this behavior in its install command override.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting system info and transmitting it to an external server during installation, with obfuscated identifiers indicating malicious intent. This pattern is consistent with potential data exfiltration in a supply chain attack.",
