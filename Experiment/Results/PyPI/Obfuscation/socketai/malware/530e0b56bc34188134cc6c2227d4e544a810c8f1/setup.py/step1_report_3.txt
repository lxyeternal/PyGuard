{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command that gathers system information and sends it to an external URL during the package installation process.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username from the environment.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends collected data to an external server, which can be used for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "System info is collected via socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser(), then transmitted via requests.get() to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obscure class and variable names, and sends system info to an external server during installation, which is unusual behavior. The URL appears suspicious and external. The code does not perform any standard setup procedures and includes data exfiltration steps.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the 'install' command from setuptools, adding functionality that executes during package installation. It collects hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data to a third-party URL. This behavior is potentially malicious as it involves covert data collection and exfiltration during setup. The code does not perform any apparent functionality related to the package's purpose, indicating possible malicious intent or privacy invasion. The obfuscation through non-descriptive class and variable names suggests an attempt to hide malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting user/system data and transmitting it to an external server during package installation. This indicates possible privacy violations or malicious intent, with a high likelihood of being malicious. The obfuscation and data exfiltration point towards malicious activity.",
