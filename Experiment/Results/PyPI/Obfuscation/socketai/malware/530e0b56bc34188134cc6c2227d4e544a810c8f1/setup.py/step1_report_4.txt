  "purpose": "Setup script that customizes installation behavior, including sending system info to an external URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with external URL and parameters",
  "flows": "Collect hostname, current working directory, and username; send this data via HTTP GET request to external server during installation",
  "anomalies": "The code sends sensitive system information to an external URL without any user consent or validation, which is suspicious. The class and variable names appear obfuscated, indicating potential attempt to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command class that, during package installation, gathers system information such as hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external domain. The data collection occurs silently during install, with no apparent user permission. The obfuscated class and variable names suggest an attempt to conceal malicious or tracking behavior. The external URL is obscure, and the data exfiltration is done through a GET request, which is a common pattern for data leaks. No other suspicious code or backdoors are evident. The use of requests to send data during install is a significant security concern, indicating potential privacy violations or malicious tracking.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating user system information during installation without user consent. It uses obfuscation and sends data to an external server, which could be used for tracking or other malicious purposes. The package should be considered suspicious and avoided.",
