      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup. The silent error handling and obfuscated filename further support this. While the exact payload isn't decoded here, the techniques used are characteristic of malware delivery. The package should be treated as high risk and further analyzed, especially decoding the PowerShell command for confirmation."
