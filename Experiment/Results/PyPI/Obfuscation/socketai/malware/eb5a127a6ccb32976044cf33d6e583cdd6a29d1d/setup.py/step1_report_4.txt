{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package named 'wessycord' with specific metadata and a custom installation process that downloads and executes an external executable file during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads external URLs during the installation process and executes downloaded files via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded executable using os.system, which can run potentially malicious code.",
  "flows": "The installation process retrieves an executable from a remote URL and then executes it, creating a source-to-sink flow that involves downloading and executing external code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, the download and execution of a payload during installation, and a lack of validation or verification of the downloaded content. The code downloads an executable from an external source and runs it without checks, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that downloads a file from a specified URL. The custom install class overrides the installation process to download and then execute this file. The URL points to an executable hosted on an anonymous file hosting service, which is retrieved during installation. The use of obfuscated variable and function names suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. Running an external executable during package installation is a common tactic for malicious activity, such as deploying backdoors, malware, or other unwanted payloads. The code does not verify the integrity or origin of the downloaded file, increasing risk. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors typical of malicious payload deployment during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external payload during installation, which could compromise systems. The obfuscated code and the direct execution of a remote executable strongly indicate malicious intent.",
