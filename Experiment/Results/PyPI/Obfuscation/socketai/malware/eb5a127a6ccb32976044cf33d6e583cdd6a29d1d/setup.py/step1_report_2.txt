{
  "purpose": "This code attempts to download and execute a file from a remote URL during the installation of a Python package, likely as part of a malicious payload or backdoor setup.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://cdn-141.anonfiles.com/scUeHf23z5/cfc2b34c-1689619361/payload.exe' is used as a source for downloading an executable file, triggered during package installation.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file is saved locally and then executed via os.system(), which can run untrusted code on the host system.",
  "flows": "Input (URL) → download file with urllib.request.urlretrieve → save locally → execute with os.system().",
  "anomalies": "The code is obfuscated through the use of non-descriptive variable and class names, and functions are designed solely to download and execute an external payload during install, which is suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that downloads a file from a hardcoded URL, and a custom install class that calls this function and then executes the downloaded file. The setup configuration uses setuptools to define package metadata, but the critical malicious behavior is the payload download and execution embedded within the custom install step. The obfuscation of variable names and the inclusion of a remote executable that is run during install strongly suggest malicious intent. The URL points to a file that, once downloaded, is executed on the target machine, which could be used for remote control, backdoor access, or other malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains clear malicious behavior—downloading and executing a remote executable during installation—indicating high malicious intent. The obfuscation and direct execution of external code during setup are significant red flags.",
