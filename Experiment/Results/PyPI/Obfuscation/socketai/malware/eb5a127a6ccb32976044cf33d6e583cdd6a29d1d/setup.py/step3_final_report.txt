{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable from a remote URL during package installation and executes it, indicating malicious intent to run external code without validation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://cdn-141.anonfiles.com/scUeHf23z5/cfc2b34c-1689619361/payload.exe' is the source from which the payload is downloaded.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded payload is executed via os.system(), which is the sink where untrusted code runs on the system.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the URL (source) through urllib.request.urlretrieve() to the local filename, then via os.system() to execution of the payload.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, hardcoded suspicious URL, immediate execution of downloaded payload without validation, behavior only triggered during installation.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the install command to include a step that downloads a payload from a suspicious URL and executes it immediately. Obfuscated names and lack of validation suggest malicious intent. The payload's purpose appears to be malicious, such as installing malware or backdoors. The behavior is consistent with supply chain attacks, and the high risk is justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external payload during package installation. The obfuscation and external URL further support malicious intent. The malware score of 1 and security risk score of 1 are justified, with high confidence (0.9).",
