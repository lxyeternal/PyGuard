{
  "purpose": "The code appears to modify the installation process of a Python package to download and execute a file from an external URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The URL specified in the function HrYIiTglCKzSNfKQrUIVYSLzfcIJzBOI, which is used to download an executable file.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file is executed immediately via os.system(), which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The package installation triggers the download of a payload.exe from a remote server, then executes it during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated function and variable names, and downloads and executes an external executable during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. It also uses os.system() to run the downloaded file, which can be dangerous.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the installation command to include a step that downloads an executable from a remote URL and executes it during installation. The function HrYIiTglCKzSNfKQrUIVYSLzfcIJzBOI downloads the file and the class method calls this function, then executes the downloaded file. The package setup details appear legitimate but are likely obfuscated. The immediate execution of downloaded code during package install is a strong indicator of malicious intent or supply chain attack.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It downloads and executes an external payload during package installation, which could be used to deliver malware or perform malicious actions on the user's system.",
