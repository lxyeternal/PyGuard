{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package named 'wessycord'. It includes custom installation behavior that downloads and executes an external file during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the URL 'https://cdn-141.anonfiles.com/scUeHf23z5/cfc2b34c-1689619361/payload.exe' during the execution of the custom install command, which is then downloaded and potentially executed.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file (payload.exe) is executed directly via os.system, which can run arbitrary code on the system.",
  "flows": "Source: URL in HrYIiTglCKzSNfKQrUIVYSLzfcIJzBOI -> Downloaded file saved locally -> Executed via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from an anonymous file hosting service and runs it without any validation, which is highly suspicious. Variable and function names are obfuscated, and the package's description is generic and misleading.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function that retrieves a file from a remote URL and saves it locally. During installation (via a custom 'install' class), it calls this function and then executes the downloaded file. The use of obfuscated variable and function names, combined with downloading and executing an external payload during installation, indicates malicious intent. This behavior could be used to deliver malware, establish backdoors, or perform malicious actions on the host system. No input validation or security checks are present, and the code's intent appears covert.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It downloads and executes an external executable during package installation, which could compromise the system. The obfuscation and direct execution of external code suggest malicious intent or malware distribution.",
