{
  "purpose": "The code appears to modify the installation process to download and execute an external payload during setup.",
  "sources": "The URL specified in the function HrYIiTglCKzSNfKQrUIVYSLzfcIJzBOI, which downloads a file from an external server.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via os.system(), which runs the payload as a system command.",
  "flows": "The setup process calls the custom install class, which triggers the download of the payload, saves it locally, and then executes it.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function and variable names, dynamic download and execution of external code during package installation, which is suspicious behavior. Hardcoded URL pointing to an executable payload on a suspicious domain.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the standard setuptools setup process by defining a custom install class. During installation, it downloads an executable file from a hardcoded URL and attempts to run it via os.system(). The obfuscated function names and variable names serve to conceal the payload's behavior. This pattern is indicative of malicious activity, as it performs external code execution during package installation without user awareness. The downloaded file's purpose is unknown, but executing it poses high security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external payload during package installation, which could compromise the host system. The use of obfuscation and hardcoded URLs further suggests malicious intent.",
