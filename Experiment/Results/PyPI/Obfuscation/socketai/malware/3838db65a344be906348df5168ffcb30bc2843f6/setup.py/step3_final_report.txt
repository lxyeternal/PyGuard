{
  "purpose": "The code installs a malicious reverse shell payload during package setup, connecting back to a hardcoded IP and port, obfuscated via base64 encoding and non-meaningful variable names.",
  "sources": "The code constructs the reverse shell command with hardcoded IP and port, formats it into a string, encodes it in base64, and executes it via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes the decoded base64 payload, which opens a reverse shell connection to the specified IP and port.",
  "flows": "Source: Hardcoded IP and port → String formatting of reverse shell command → Base64 encoding → Decoding during execution → os.system executes the command (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names, base64 encoding of malicious payload, hardcoded IP and port, execution during setup, no external inputs involved.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during package installation, constructs a reverse shell command targeting IP 121.4.154.240 on port 4501. The command is obfuscated by base64 encoding and variable name obfuscation, then decoded and executed via os.system, establishing a remote connection. This behavior is a clear backdoor and malicious activity. The obfuscation techniques and hardcoded malicious payload confirm malicious intent. The code poses a severe security risk, enabling remote control of the host machine. The analysis aligns with the reports, which correctly identify the malicious behavior with high confidence. The malware score should be 1.0, obfuscation score around 0.8, and security risk score at 1.0.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains explicit malicious behavior—establishing a reverse shell during package installation—indicating a supply chain attack. It is highly malicious, obfuscated, and poses a severe security threat. The reports are accurate and justified in their assessments.",
