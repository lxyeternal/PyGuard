{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package, but it includes malicious code to establish a reverse shell connection to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, encodes data with base64, and constructs a command string to execute via os.system. The malicious payload is embedded directly within the class constructor.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a base64-decoded shell command that opens a reverse shell, connecting to an external IP address and port.",
  "flows": "The malicious string is generated in the class constructor, base64 encoded, then decoded and executed via os.system, establishing a network connection to the attacker-controlled server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name, obfuscated variable names, and the code to create a reverse shell are significant anomalies. The code executes network operations during package installation, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class inheriting from setuptools' install. Within the constructor, it constructs a reverse shell command that connects to IP '121.4.154.240' on port 4501. This command is base64-encoded, then decoded and executed via os.system during the setup process. This behavior is highly unusual and malicious, as it opens an unauthorized remote access channel during package installation. No legitimate setup process would execute such network code. The obfuscated variable names and the embedding of the reverse shell payload further suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior: it executes a reverse shell to an external server during package installation. This constitutes a supply chain attack vector and indicates malicious intent. The package should be considered dangerous and should not be used.",
