{
  "purpose": "Setup script that installs a Python package and attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a specified IP address and port during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs; it uses hardcoded values for IP and port, and encodes a command string for execution.",
  "sinks": "The code executes a base64-decoded shell command via os.system, which initiates a reverse shell connection to a remote host, potentially allowing remote control.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded IP and port are embedded into a shell command, which is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed, creating a connection back to the attacker’s server.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded IP address and port, obfuscated command encoding, and the execution of a reverse shell payload during package installation are highly suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the 'install' command to inject malicious behavior during the package installation process. It constructs a reverse shell command that connects to a remote server, encodes it in base64, and executes it via os.system. This is a classic method for maintaining persistence or remote control access. The use of base64 encoding and dynamic command execution suggests obfuscation to hide malicious intent. No user input or external data sources are involved; the malicious payload is hardcoded within the setup script. Overall, this code aims to create a backdoor during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code that establishes a reverse shell connection to an external server during installation, representing a severe security risk. The code's obfuscation and hardcoded malicious payload indicate malicious intent.",
