{
  "purpose": "Customize installation process to execute a remote code execution payload during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the base64-encoded string of a shell command that initiates a reverse shell connection to a remote IP and port.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes the decoded base64 payload, which opens a reverse shell connection to the specified IP and port.",
  "flows": "The payload string is generated, encoded in base64, then decoded and executed via os.system, leading to remote shell access.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code using base64 encoding for the payload, dynamic execution of shell commands, and hardcoded IP and port suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that, during installation, constructs a reverse shell payload targeting IP 121.4.154.240 on port 4501. It encodes this payload in base64 and executes it using os.system, which results in a remote connection and potential control over the host machine. The use of base64 encoding and dynamic command execution are typical indicators of malicious behavior. The IP address and port are hardcoded, indicating intentional malicious activity rather than benign functionality. No other benign or security-related functionality is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to create a reverse shell during package installation, enabling unauthorized remote access. It exhibits obfuscation techniques and hardcoded malicious IP and port, confirming its harmful intent.",
