{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package but contains a malicious payload designed to establish a reverse shell connection to an external IP address.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly, but it constructs a shell command embedded with IP and port information.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a base64-decoded shell command that initiates a reverse shell connection to an external server.",
  "flows": "The payload constructs a malicious shell command, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system, leading to a reverse shell connection to 121.4.154.240 on port 4501.",
  "anomalies": "The class name is obfuscated; it encodes a reverse shell payload; it base64-encodes the command and executes it via os.system, which is suspicious. Also, the setup script includes malicious code in the install method.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup modules and defines a custom install class with a method that runs during installation. Within this method, it constructs a reverse shell command to connect back to an external IP address. The command is formatted with hardcoded IP and port, then base64-encoded, and finally decoded and executed with os.system. This indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity. The reverse shell code allows remote control of the system upon installation, which is a malicious behavior. The package setup parameters are normal but are exploited to execute malicious code during installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a clear malicious payload designed to establish a reverse shell connection during package installation. The reverse shell connection can give an attacker remote control over the compromised system, indicating high malicious intent. The rest of the setup code appears standard but is exploited for malicious purposes.",
