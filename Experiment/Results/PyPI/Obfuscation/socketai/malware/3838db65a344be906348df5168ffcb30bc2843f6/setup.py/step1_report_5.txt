{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to install a Python package and then executes a potentially malicious reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded IP address and port variables, and constructs a shell command that is base64-encoded.",
  "sinks": "Execution of a base64-decoded shell command via os.system, which opens a reverse shell to the specified IP and port.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it, establishing a network connection to a remote host and potentially giving remote control.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable names, encodes the malicious command in base64, and uses os.system to execute the command, all of which are common tactics to hide malicious intent. The reverse shell code is embedded directly in the setup process, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the installation process by subclassing the 'install' command. During installation, it constructs a reverse shell command aimed at IP 121.4.154.240 on port 4501. The command is encoded in base64 and then decoded before execution, which is a tactic to obfuscate malicious activity. The command, when executed, creates a reverse shell, connecting the remote IP to the system and providing an attacker with command-line access. The code uses standard modules like os and socket for network activity, with obfuscated variable names and encoding to evade detection. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious code designed to establish unauthorized remote access during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior—attempting to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server during package installation. The obfuscation techniques and embedded network activity indicate malicious intent, representing a security risk if this package is used. The overall security risk score is high, and malware presence is confirmed.",
