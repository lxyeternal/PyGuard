{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a remote executable from a hardcoded URL and executes it immediately on Windows systems, indicating malicious intent to run unauthorized code during import.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://github.com/jagermager999/8746465cdg78cdsxasy8a/raw/main/test.exe' is fetched via requests.get, and the content is written to a file; the code then executes this file with os.system.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded executable is saved locally and executed without validation, allowing potential malicious code to run with system privileges.",
  "flows": "requests.get retrieves the executable from the URL, writes it to a file, and os.system executes the file, all during module import.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate execution of remote code during import, obfuscated function name, hardcoded URL, no validation or user prompt, and execution only on Windows platform.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it immediately on Windows, with obfuscated naming indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. The download and execution happen during module import, with no validation or user interaction, representing a high security threat. The setup metadata is standard but overshadowed by this malicious payload. The behavior aligns with known supply chain attack patterns, and the code's actions are clearly malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing remote code execution during import, which poses a severe security risk. The high malware score of 1.0, obfuscation score of 0.8, and risk score of 1.0 are justified based on the behavior. It should be flagged and removed from distribution to prevent system compromise.",
