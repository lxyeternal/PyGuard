{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package and simultaneously download and execute a potentially malicious executable from an external URL.",
  "sources": "The URL in the function tRKGBiqSpHVHvYoITFXUpAqglKcODAuf(), which fetches an executable file; os.system call executing the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "The open() function writes the downloaded content to a file; os.system() executes the downloaded file, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "The function fetches content from the URL -> writes to a local file -> executes the file via os.system, creating a source-to-sink flow that executes remote code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, which obscure the purpose; direct download and execution of an external executable upon import; no validation or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing modules and defining a function with an obfuscated name. This function checks for Windows platform, downloads an executable from a GitHub URL, saves it locally, and immediately executes it via os.system. The setup() call is standard for package setup but is accompanied by the malicious function call executed at import. The URL points to a raw executable file, and executing it without validation or user prompt constitutes a significant security risk. The obfuscated naming and immediate execution indicate malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior. The code does not verify the integrity or origin of the downloaded file, nor does it provide any user notification.",
  "conclusion": "The script includes a hidden malicious behavior that downloads and executes a remote executable immediately upon import, representing a high security risk. The obfuscation and execution of external code suggest malicious intent, potentially leading to system compromise.",
