{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python setup script for a package named 'eckohl21kml78ztt', but it includes malicious behavior that downloads and executes an external executable file.",
  "sources": "The function tRKGBiqSpHVHvYoITFXUpAqglKcODAuf() reads data from a remote URL using requests.get() and then writes the content to a local file.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded executable is executed immediately via os.system('start ...'), which can run arbitrary malicious code.",
  "flows": "Input source: requests.get() fetches remote content. Sink: open().write() saves the file locally. Next sink: os.system() executes the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated or non-descriptive function and variable names. It conditionally downloads and runs an executable only on Windows systems, which is suspicious. The URL points to a raw GitHub content that is likely malicious executable. The script automatically executes downloaded content without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing modules and defining a function with an obscure name. Inside the function, it checks for Windows platform, then fetches an executable from a GitHub URL, saves it with a filename, and runs it immediately. This behavior indicates potential malware, as it downloads and executes code without user awareness. The setup() function appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the malicious function call at startup. The code's structure suggests intent to infect the system, especially given the immediate execution of downloaded payload. The obfuscated naming and URL choice strongly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior: it downloads and executes a remote executable without user consent. The presence of obfuscated names, conditional Windows-only execution, and the execution of external payloads confirm malicious intent. It poses a high security risk and should not be used.",
