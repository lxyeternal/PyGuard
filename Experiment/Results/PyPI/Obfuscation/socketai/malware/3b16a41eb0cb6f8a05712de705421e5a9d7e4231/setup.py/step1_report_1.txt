{
  "purpose": "This script appears to be designed for setting up a Python package with some metadata and dependencies. However, it also includes malicious behavior that downloads and executes a potentially harmful executable from an external source.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system platform to determine OS, fetches a URL containing an executable via requests.get, and writes the content to a temporary file.",
  "sinks": "The code writes the downloaded content to a file and executes it using os.system('start ...'), which can run arbitrary malicious code without user consent.",
  "flows": "The code fetches data from an external URL, saves it locally, and then executes it, creating a source-to-sink path from the network input to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes the immediate download and execution of an executable from a hardcoded URL, which is typical of malware. The code has no validation or user prompt before executing the downloaded file.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with standard package setup but then defines a function that, on Windows, downloads an executable from a suspicious GitHub URL and runs it. This behavior is not related to package setup or typical build scripts. The URL and filename are hardcoded, and the execution is automated without user interaction or verification. The rest of the code is standard setup metadata, but the malicious part dominates the behavior. No obfuscation or code complexity is present; the malicious intent is explicit.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior: it downloads and executes a potentially harmful executable from an external source, representing a supply chain attack vector. It should not be used or distributed. The remaining setup code appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the malicious payload.",
