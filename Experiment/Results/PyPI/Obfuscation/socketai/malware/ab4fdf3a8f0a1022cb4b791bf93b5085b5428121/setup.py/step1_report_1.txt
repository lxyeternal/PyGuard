{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it includes malicious behavior such as cloning repositories, creating files in startup folders, and executing files, which suggests it is intended for persistence or malware delivery.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, the user's login name via os.getlogin(), and lists directory contents with os.listdir. It also takes untrusted data from the Git URLs, although these are hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "The code creates directories and files in startup folders, renames files, and executes a specific executable file via os.startfile. It clones remote repositories, which could be malicious payloads, and executes an external file.",
  "flows": "The code uses os.getlogin() to generate paths, clones remote repositories, moves a 'test.py' file, and executes 'main.exe' from a specific directory, indicating data flows from remote URLs and filesystem operations to process execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically creates directories in startup folders, clones repositories from suspicious URLs, moves files within user directories, and executes a specific executable, all of which are suspicious behaviors. The code also uses obfuscated class and variable names, and the setup script is repurposed for malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "Initially, the script defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation process. Inside, it sets environment variables and uses the git library to clone two remote repositories from suspicious URLs. It creates directories in the user's startup folder, which is commonly used for persistence. It then moves a file named 'test.py' from a subdirectory into another location in startup. Finally, it executes a specific 'main.exe' file, likely a payload. These actions are embedded within what appears to be a setup.py script, indicating malicious intent masked as a package installer. The use of obfuscated class names and indirect file manipulations supports suspicion of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious activity, including persistence setup, remote repository cloning, file renaming, and execution of external binaries. These actions are typical of malware seeking to establish persistence, deliver payloads, or exfiltrate data. The overall purpose appears to be malicious rather than legitimate package setup.",
