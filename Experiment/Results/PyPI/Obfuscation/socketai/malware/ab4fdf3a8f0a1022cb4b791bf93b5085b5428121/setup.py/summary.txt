  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, designed to establish persistence, clone remote repositories, and execute external binaries stealthily. The high obfuscation and aggressive behaviors justify maximum malware and risk scores. All evidence indicates a high-confidence malicious activity requiring immediate attention."
