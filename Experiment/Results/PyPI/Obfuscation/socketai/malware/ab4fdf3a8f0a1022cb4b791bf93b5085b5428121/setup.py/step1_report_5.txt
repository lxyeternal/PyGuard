{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package, which clones malicious repositories, manipulates startup files, and executes a potentially harmful executable.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, system login info, and file system (os.getlogin(), os.path.exists(), os.listdir()), and imports modules such as os, git, and os.startfile.",
  "sinks": "Cloning remote repositories, renaming files, creating directories in startup folders, executing an external .exe file via os.startfile.",
  "flows": "Input from environment and file system (system login, directory listing) -> clone repositories and manipulate files -> rename files and execute external executable.",
  "anomalies": "Cloning suspicious repositories from GitHub, creating directories in startup folders, renaming files to 'test.py' in startup directories, executing a .exe from a subdirectory in startup folder. Use of obfuscated class and method names suggests concealment. No clear legitimate purpose for these actions.",
  "analysis": "The code initiates by setting environment variables and importing modules. It then defines a class with a method that manipulates the Windows startup folder paths, creates directories, and clones repositories from GitHub, which could be malicious. It renames a file to 'test.py' in startup folders and executes an executable from a subdirectory of the startup folder. These actions are typical of persistence mechanisms and backdoors. The obfuscated class and method names indicate an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The code does not validate the repositories' content or purpose, indicating potentially malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits high malicious intent by establishing persistence, downloading external payloads, and executing potentially harmful files without user consent. Its obfuscation and behavior strongly suggest malicious purposes, such as backdoor installation or system compromise.",
