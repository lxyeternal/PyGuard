{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to potentially execute malicious code during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads a base64-encoded IP address and port, then creates a socket connection to that address and port.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection is connected to a remote server, and a shell is invoked, allowing remote command execution.",
  "flows": "The code decodes the IP and port, connects to the server, duplicates the socket file descriptor to standard input, output, and error, then launches a shell, enabling remote control.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and function names are obfuscated. The code establishes a reverse shell to a hardcoded IP and port. Use of base64 encoding for IP and port obfuscation. No comments or documentation. The installation process triggers the malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script that, upon installation, executes a reverse shell connection to a specific IP address and port. It uses base64 encoding to obscure the IP and port. The socket connection redirects standard input/output/error to the remote server, then launches an interactive shell, enabling remote control of the host. The obfuscated class and function names further suggest malicious intent. This behavior is consistent with backdoor or remote access trojan functions. The package, when installed, can compromise the host system by providing unauthorized remote access.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code designed to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server during installation, effectively creating a backdoor. The obfuscation, reverse shell, and hardcoded IP address strongly indicate malicious intent.",
