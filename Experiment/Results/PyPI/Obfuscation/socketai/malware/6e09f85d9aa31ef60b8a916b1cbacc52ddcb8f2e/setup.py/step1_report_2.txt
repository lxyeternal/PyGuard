  "purpose": "Customize package installation process to execute a reverse shell upon installation.",
  "sources": "Base64 encoded IP address and port, socket connection, subprocess call to spawn shell.",
  "sinks": "socket connection to remote host, subprocess to execute shell, os.dup2 to redirect file descriptors.",
  "flows": "Decoding IP and port -> establishing socket connection -> redirecting stdin, stdout, stderr -> spawning shell.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, base64-encoded IP address, reverse shell execution during setup, connection to external IP, no user consent prompts.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom setup class that overrides the install method to connect to an external IP address (49.233.121.53) on port 54 using a base64-decoded IP and port. It then redirects system input/output/error streams to this socket and executes an interactive shell ('/bin/sh -i'), effectively creating a reverse shell. This behavior is malicious, as it allows remote control of the system during package installation. The code is obfuscated with nonsensical class and variable names, likely to evade detection. The connection is hardcoded and triggered automatically upon package installation, representing a serious security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it establishes a reverse shell connection to a remote host during package installation, which can be used for unauthorized access. Its obfuscated style and execution of a shell indicate malicious intent. Overall security risk is high.",
