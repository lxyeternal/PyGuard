  "purpose": "Custom setup script that installs a Python package and executes a malicious reverse shell upon installation.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded IP address and port, socket connection, subprocess call to spawn shell.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection leading to remote host, subprocess call executing shell, os.dup2 manipulating file descriptors.",
  "flows": "Decodes IP/port -> establishes socket connection -> redirects stdin/out/err -> spawns shell.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, use of base64 decoding for IP and port, reverse shell behavior embedded in setup process.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon installation, calls a function to connect to a remote server at IP 49.233.121.53 and port 54. It decodes the IP and port from base64, then creates a socket connection. It redirects standard input, output, and error to this socket, then executes a shell. These actions constitute a reverse shell setup, which is highly suspicious. The malicious behavior is embedded within the setup process, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated names and decoding further suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior—specifically, it sets up a reverse shell to a remote server during package installation. This constitutes a security risk and indicates malicious intent. The package should be considered dangerous for use.",
