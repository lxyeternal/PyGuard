  "purpose": "Establishes a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP and port during package installation, enabling remote control of the host system.",
  "sources": "Decoding base64 strings for IP ('NDkuMjMzLjEyMS41Mw==') and port ('NTQ='), socket connection to the decoded IP and port, and execution of '/bin/sh -i'.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to external server, redirection of stdin, stdout, stderr to the socket, and spawning an interactive shell via subprocess.call.",
  "flows": "Decodes IP and port from base64 -> creates socket -> connects to remote IP and port -> redirects system streams to socket -> executes shell.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for IP and port, obfuscated class and function names, automatic execution during setup, and establishing a reverse shell without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during package installation, calls a function which decodes a hardcoded IP and port from base64, establishes a socket connection to that address, redirects all system input/output/error streams to this socket, and spawns an interactive shell. The obfuscated names and base64 encoding suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The behavior is characteristic of a reverse shell backdoor, allowing remote control over the host system. The code executes these actions automatically during setup, which is a supply chain security risk. The connection to external IP (49.233.121.53) on port 54 is hardcoded, and the entire process is triggered during package installation, making it a severe security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, implementing a reverse shell backdoor during package installation. It uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding and nonsensical naming to evade detection. The behavior is consistent with malicious sabotage and supply chain attack vectors. The malware score is 1, the security risk score is 1, and the obfuscation score is approximately 0.8. The overall threat level is high, and the package should be flagged and removed from distribution to prevent compromise.",
