  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, implementing a reverse shell backdoor during package installation. It uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding and nonsensical naming to evade detection. The behavior is consistent with malicious sabotage and supply chain attack vectors. The malware score is 1, the security risk score is 1, and the obfuscation score is approximately 0.8. The overall threat level is high, and the package should be flagged and removed from distribution to prevent compromise."
