{
  "purpose": "This code modifies the installation process of a Python package to execute a reverse shell connection to a specific IP address and port during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded IP address and port, and decodes base64-encoded strings to get connection parameters.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection and subprocess call can be used to establish a remote shell, allowing code execution on the host system.",
  "flows": "The code decodes network parameters, creates a socket, connects to the remote server, duplicates socket file descriptors to standard input/output/error, then launches a shell, providing remote access.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and function names, base64 decoding of connection parameters, and initiating a reverse shell during package installation are suspicious behaviors. The code actively connects to an external IP and executes a shell, which is abnormal for legitimate setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script redefines the install command to include malicious behavior. It decodes an IP and port from base64 strings, creates a socket, and connects to the remote host. It then redirects standard input/output/error to this socket, and spawns a shell, effectively granting remote access. The code is embedded in a setup script, making it likely to execute upon package installation, which is malicious. The use of obfuscation, base64 encoding, and network-based code execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior implementing a reverse shell that triggers during package installation. It appears designed for remote control or backdoor access, representing a high security threat. It should be considered malicious and avoided.",
