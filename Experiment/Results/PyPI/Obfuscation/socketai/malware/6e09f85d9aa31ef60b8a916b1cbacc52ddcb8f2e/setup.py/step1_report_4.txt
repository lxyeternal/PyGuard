{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that, upon installation, attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server, potentially allowing remote command execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from base64-encoded strings for IP address and port, and uses socket and subprocess modules to initiate network and system interactions.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection and subprocess call create a reverse shell, providing remote control over the system's shell, which can be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "flows": "The setup process triggers the custom install class, which decodes base64 strings to obtain IP and port, then connects to the remote server and redirects standard input/output/error to this socket, ultimately executing '/bin/sh' interactively.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, use of base64 encoding for IP and port, and automatic reverse shell upon installation are suspicious. The code performs network connections and system shell execution without user consent or transparency.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup and install modules, then defines a class that overrides the install method. During installation, it calls a function that decodes base64-encoded IP ('49.233.121.53') and port ('54'), then creates a socket connection to this remote server. It duplicates socket file descriptors to standard input, output, and error, then executes an interactive shell ('/bin/sh') via subprocess. These actions effectively establish a reverse shell back to the specified IP and port. The code is obfuscated with meaningless class and function names, which is typical of malicious scripts trying to evade detection. The network activity and shell execution are strong indicators of malicious intent, likely allowing remote control or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, establishing a reverse shell during package installation, which can be used for unauthorized access or control of the system. The obfuscation and execution of network and shell commands without user consent indicate malicious behavior.",
