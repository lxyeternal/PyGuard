      "confidence": 1,
      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, implementing a reverse shell backdoor during package installation. It uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding and nonsensical naming to evade detection. The behavior is consistent with malicious sabotage and supply chain attack vectors. The malware score is 1, the security risk score is 1, and the obfuscation score is approximately 0.8. The overall threat level is high, and the package should be flagged and removed from distribution to prevent compromise."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior consistent with malicious intent, primarily through obfuscation and execution of a shell command that signals malicious activity. While it does not perform destructive actions, its pattern warrants high suspicion and security concern."
