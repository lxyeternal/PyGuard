{
  "purpose": "Execute a system command that outputs a message indicating malicious code execution.",
  "sources": "The function GsmiiseFKtpggghzDZsqdzkcGQOjeurF() which calls os.system to run a shell command.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a shell command, which can be used to run arbitrary commands.",
  "flows": "The script calls the function GsmiiseFKtpggghzDZsqdzkcGQOjeurF() upon execution, which directly invokes os.system with a hardcoded command.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated function name, executing a shell command that prints a message in Chinese indicating successful malicious code execution. The code does not accept input but executes a hardcoded command, which suggests malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines an obfuscated function that, when called, executes a system command using os.system. The command is to echo a message indicating malicious code execution. The function is invoked if the script is run directly, ensuring the command executes upon script start. The code's primary purpose appears to be to demonstrate or execute malicious activity via shell command execution. The obfuscated naming adds to suspicion, and the hardcoded command confirms malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to execute a system command that outputs a message indicating successful malicious code execution. It uses obfuscation and direct system calls to perform potentially harmful actions, aligning with malicious behavior.",
