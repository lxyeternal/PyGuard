{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform malicious activities during package installation, including exfiltrating system information, downloading and executing external payloads, and obfuscating its behavior to evade detection.",
  "sources": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; makes HTTP GET requests to suspicious URLs; downloads a file ('python-install.scr') from a malicious domain; uses obfuscated function and class names.",
  "sinks": "Executes downloaded payload via 'os.system'; sends system info to external server; potentially executes malicious code hidden within downloaded files.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variable -> Sends data to remote server -> Downloads payload -> Executes payload via system call.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad try-except blocks suppressing errors; obfuscated function and class names; downloading and executing external files during setup; hardcoded suspicious URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment variable reading, network requests to suspicious domains, downloads an executable, and runs it silently, all during setup. Obfuscated identifiers and error suppression mask malicious intent. These behaviors are characteristic of supply chain malware designed to compromise systems, exfiltrate data, and execute arbitrary code. The code's activities are consistent with malicious behavior, with high confidence. The obfuscation and external payload execution are clear indicators of malicious intent, justifying high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, actively exfiltrates data, downloads and executes external payloads, and employs obfuscation to hide its intent. It poses a high security threat and should be flagged as malicious.",
