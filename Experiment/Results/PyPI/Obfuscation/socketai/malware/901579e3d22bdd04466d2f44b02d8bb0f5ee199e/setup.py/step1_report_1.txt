{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a custom setup script for a Python package, with additional code that performs network requests and executes a downloaded file during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs. It also downloads a file from a suspicious URL and executes it via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file using 'os.system' as well as network requests to potentially malicious domains.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is read, then a request is sent to 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation ...'. If on Windows, a second request downloads an executable from 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', which is then saved locally and executed with 'os.system'.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically downloads and executes an external file during installation, which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The URLs used are suspicious and indicative of potential malware distribution. The code uses try-except without specific exception handling, masking errors that could reveal malicious activity. Variable and function names are obfuscated, and the code structure is intentionally convoluted.",
  "analysis": "The code is a modified setup script that incorporates malicious activity. It reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable to send system-specific info to a remote server. On Windows systems, it downloads a script or executable from a suspicious domain and runs it without user consent, indicating potential malware delivery. The use of obfuscated function and variable names suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. Overall, the code combines legitimate setup tasks with malicious payload delivery, characteristic of supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior: it downloads and executes external code during installation, which could compromise the host system. The obfuscated code and suspicious URLs strongly suggest malicious intent.",
