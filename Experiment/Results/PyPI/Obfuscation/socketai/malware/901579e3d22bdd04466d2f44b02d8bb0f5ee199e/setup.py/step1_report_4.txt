{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a Python package setup script that, during installation, attempts to execute potentially malicious actions such as downloading and executing remote files and sending environment data to a server.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and performs HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "The code writes files to the local system and executes downloaded files using os.system('start ...'), which can run malicious payloads. It also sends data to an external server.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent via a GET request. If on Windows, a remote script is downloaded and executed with 'os.system', representing a direct execution flow from external data sources to system execution.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'DkovYZZVGdGxqyivjyQUdhZtMdFPlWwG' is obfuscated. It downloads and executes a file from a suspicious URL, and the code attempts to send environment data to an external server, indicative of malicious intent. The class and function names are also nonsensical and obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules but includes obfuscated function and class names, which is suspicious. It gathers environment information ('COMPUTERNAME') and sends it to a remote server. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it, which is a common malware behavior. The use of try-except with silent failure may hide errors, making detection harder. Overall, the code exhibits typical signs of malware embedded in a package setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior, including data exfiltration and remote code execution. It is designed to perform unauthorized actions during package installation. The obfuscation and behavior strongly suggest malicious intent.",
