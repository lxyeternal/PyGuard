{
  "purpose": "Simple script that prints a message indicating installation or presence.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only uses the print function with a static string.",
  "sinks": "The print function outputs static text to stdout; no untrusted data handling or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static message is printed directly.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which may indicate attempts to hide intent, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with an obfuscated name that, when called, prints a fixed string. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no suspicious network or file operations. The only notable aspect is the obfuscated function name, which might be used to hide purpose, but the actual code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script simply prints a static message with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscated function name alone is not sufficient to suggest malicious behavior, given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.",
