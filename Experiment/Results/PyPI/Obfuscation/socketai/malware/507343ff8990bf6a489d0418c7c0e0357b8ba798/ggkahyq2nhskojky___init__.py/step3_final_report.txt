{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard __init__.py module with imports and exports for a package related to proxy or SOCKS connection handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules with obfuscated class and function names, version declaration, and __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code only imports and exports symbols; there are no runtime data flows or execution paths indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, but this alone does not imply malicious intent; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package initialization file with obfuscated identifiers. The provided security reports are empty, indicating no detailed analysis or evidence of issues. Given the lack of payload, network activity, or suspicious code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The obfuscation may be a stylistic choice rather than malicious intent. The reports' 'Empty response' messages suggest incomplete or placeholder reports, not actual findings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious or security issues. The reports lack substantive data; therefore, the security risk and malware scores should be set to zero. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe, and the reports do not justify concern.",
