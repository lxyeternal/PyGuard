  "review": "Let's analyze this systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The provided code snippet appears to be a standard Python module with imports, version declaration, and `__all__`. It does not contain any executable logic or code that could be malicious or vulnerable.\n   - The reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response data, which suggests there is no detailed information about potential issues or malicious activity in the reports.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Summary**:\n   - The reports do not provide any content beyond indicating \"Empty response.\" Therefore, there's no basis to evaluate or critique their reasoning.\n   - The lack of detailed responses means the reports are uninformative and do not specify any actual vulnerabilities, malware, or flaws.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - Since no specific issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity are described, the malware score should be **0**.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be **0**, as there's no evidence of obfuscation or malicious hiding.\n   - The risk score should be **0** because no issues are identified.\n\n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports seem to assume issues exist solely because responses are empty, but without any content, this is purely speculative.\n   - Without concrete evidence or details, claims about vulnerabilities or malware are unfounded.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores with the Report**:\n   - Given the absence of any evidence, the scores should reflect no detected issues.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation**:\n   - The code provided appears benign and standard.\n   - The reports do not contain any substantive information to suggest malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no evidence of obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no issues identified)\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the provided code and the empty reports, there is no indication of any security incident, malware, or vulnerabilities. The reports are essentially uninformative and do not warrant concern.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that reports include detailed responses for accurate assessment. Empty responses do not provide any grounds for concern.",
