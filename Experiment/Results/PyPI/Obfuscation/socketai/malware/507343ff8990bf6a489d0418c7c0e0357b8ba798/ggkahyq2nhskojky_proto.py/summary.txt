  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SOCKS proxy client with significant obfuscation. While obfuscation can be used to hide malicious behavior, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity in this fragment. The high obfuscation score reflects the complexity, and the low malware score indicates low suspicion based on current analysis. Moderate risk is assigned due to potential concealment, but no active malicious actions are detected."
