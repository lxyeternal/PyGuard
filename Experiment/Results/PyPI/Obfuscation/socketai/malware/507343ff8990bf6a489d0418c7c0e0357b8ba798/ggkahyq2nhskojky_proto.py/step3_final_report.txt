  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, managing network connections, authentication, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Socket input/output, address parameters, user credentials, environment checks for event loops.",
  "sinks": "Socket send/recv operations, DNS resolution, address packing/unpacking, network connection attempts.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and socket data through socket send/recv functions, address resolution, and protocol message construction.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with non-descriptive class and variable names, dynamic import checks for event loops, complex control flow, and conditional module handling.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with methods for connection, authentication, and address resolution. Obfuscation and dynamic environment checks are used, which could conceal malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious external connections are evident. Socket operations and protocol handling appear standard. The obfuscation and complex control flow increase the difficulty of static analysis but do not directly indicate malicious intent. The code's structure aligns with legitimate proxy client implementations, though the obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SOCKS proxy client with significant obfuscation. While obfuscation can be used to hide malicious behavior, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity in this fragment. The high obfuscation score reflects the complexity, and the low malware score indicates low suspicion based on current analysis. Moderate risk is assigned due to potential concealment, but no active malicious actions are detected.",
