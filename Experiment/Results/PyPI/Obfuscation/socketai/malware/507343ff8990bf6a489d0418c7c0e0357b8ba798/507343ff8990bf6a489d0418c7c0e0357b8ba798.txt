      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and exhibits clear signs of malicious intent. It decodes and executes embedded payloads, manipulates system paths, and employs obfuscation techniques typical of malware. Given these indicators, the code should be classified as malicious with maximum severity."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious or security issues. The reports lack substantive data; therefore, the security risk and malware scores should be set to zero. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe, and the reports do not justify concern."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed for URL parsing and establishing network connections with proxy support. While obfuscation and dynamic URL handling raise suspicion, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The low malware score (0.2) reflects this, but the high obfuscation score (0.65) indicates caution. The moderate security risk (0.35) suggests careful review is warranted, especially regarding input validation and source trustworthiness."

      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates signs of obfuscation and complex proxy management that could be exploited maliciously, but no concrete malicious actions are evident in this fragment. It warrants further investigation, especially runtime behavior and imported modules, but based solely on this code, it does not contain confirmed malware."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SOCKS proxy client with significant obfuscation. While obfuscation can be used to hide malicious behavior, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity in this fragment. The high obfuscation score reflects the complexity, and the low malware score indicates low suspicion based on current analysis. Moderate risk is assigned due to potential concealment, but no active malicious actions are detected."
