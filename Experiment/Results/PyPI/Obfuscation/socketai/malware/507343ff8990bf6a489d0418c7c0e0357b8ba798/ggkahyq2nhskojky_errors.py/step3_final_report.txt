{
  "purpose": "Define multiple obfuscated custom exception classes with no operational logic or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with obfuscated names, inheriting from Exception or OSError.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output or external resource access present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class inheritance without data or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class names, no methods or logic, potential placeholder or concealment tactic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for custom exceptions with obfuscated names, inheriting from standard exception classes. There is no logic, data handling, or external interaction, indicating the code is either placeholder or intentionally obfuscated. The obfuscation is superficial, aimed at concealment, but does not demonstrate malicious behavior. Malware scores are zero, consistent with the absence of malicious activity. Obfuscation scores are high, reflecting the nonsensical class names. Risk scores are low, acknowledging obfuscation as a potential concern but not indicating active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of obfuscated exception class definitions with no evidence of malicious intent. While obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring, there is no immediate security threat based solely on this snippet.",
