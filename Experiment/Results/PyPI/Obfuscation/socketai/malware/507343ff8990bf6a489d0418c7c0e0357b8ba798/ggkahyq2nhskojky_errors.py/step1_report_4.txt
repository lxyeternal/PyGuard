{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes, likely for specific error handling in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance declarations, no input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No evidence of data output, external connections, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance does not indicate data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated and do not convey meaningful intent; no actual code logic or data handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of obfuscated class definitions inheriting from standard exception classes. No logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. The obfuscation may be an attempt to hide intent, but without behavior, it appears to be benign. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious activities. The code is highly minimal and does not execute any operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code only defines obfuscated custom exception classes without any operational logic. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or data leaks. The obfuscation may be superficial or a placeholder, but based on the code shown, it appears benign.",
