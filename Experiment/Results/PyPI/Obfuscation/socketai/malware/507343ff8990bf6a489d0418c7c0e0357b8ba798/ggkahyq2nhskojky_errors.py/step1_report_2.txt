{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes, some inheriting from built-in exceptions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance statements, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance hierarchy without data flow or untrusted data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "All class names are obfuscated, and classes are solely for exception handling. No code logic, data handling, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of obfuscated class declarations inheriting from Exception or OSError. No executable logic, data processing, or external input handling present. The obfuscated naming style could suggest concealment, but it does not necessarily imply malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or suspicious behavior detected. The absence of code execution, data manipulation, or external communications indicates low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It is likely part of a larger, obscured project or intended to conceal exception handling details, but it does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
