{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes, mostly inheriting from a base exception class, with no additional functionality.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance declarations; no input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or vulnerable points; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; only class inheritance structures.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated and appear intentionally nonsensical, suggesting potential concealment. No logic, data handling, or functional code present.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions, with obfuscated names, which may be used to conceal malicious intent or maliciously obfuscate code behavior. There are no operations, data processing, network calls, or other behaviors that could indicate malicious activity or supply chain threats. The lack of functional code limits risk assessment, but the obfuscation and minimal content are suspicious as they could be part of a larger malicious module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be solely defining obfuscated custom exceptions with no functional or operational code. This pattern can be used to conceal malicious intent or obscure malicious code elsewhere in a larger codebase. On its own, this code does not demonstrate malicious behavior but warrants caution due to obfuscation and lack of transparency.",
