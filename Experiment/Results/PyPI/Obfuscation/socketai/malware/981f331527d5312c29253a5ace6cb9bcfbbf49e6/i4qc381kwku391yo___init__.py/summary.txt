  "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign; no malicious activity is evident. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the 'downrun' package. If the package is from an untrusted source or known to be malicious, the risk increases. The malware score should be elevated accordingly, but without evidence of malicious code, it remains low. The security risk score should reflect dependency trust issues, not active malicious behavior."
