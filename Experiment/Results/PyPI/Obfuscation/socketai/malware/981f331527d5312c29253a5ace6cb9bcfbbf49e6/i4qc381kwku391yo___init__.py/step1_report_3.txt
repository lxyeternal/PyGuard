  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations are visible in this snippet",
  "flows": "N/A; only an import statement, no data flow present",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code present; only an import statement. Cannot determine if 'downrun' performs malicious activities based solely on this line.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'downrun' from a package 'downrun'. Without additional code or context, it's not possible to identify malicious behavior. The import itself is standard. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or suspicious code are evident. The package's purpose cannot be inferred solely from this snippet. Additional code would be needed to evaluate further.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any active code that could be malicious or risky.",
