  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with minimal dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, version info, and requirements from the script itself.",
  "targets": "No clear sink for untrusted data; the code only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from external sources to sinks; typical setup code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names not meaningful, but do not indicate malicious intent; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define a package with static metadata. Variable names are obfuscated but do not contribute to malicious behavior. No input handling or external data fetching present. The 'download and run a file fr' string in a variable does not seem to be used in any dangerous context. Overall, the code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malicious code execution, or security risks. The unusual variable names are likely just obfuscation without malicious purpose.",
