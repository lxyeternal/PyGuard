  "purpose": "Download a file from a URL and open a local file.",
  "sources": "The 'file' parameter used in the f-string for the curl command; the 'filename' parameter used in os.start.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing the curl command with untrusted input; os.start opening the filename.",
  "flows": "Untrusted 'file' input flows into the curl command via string interpolation, potentially leading to command injection; 'filename' flows into os.start, which could be exploited if maliciously crafted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with unsanitized input; no input validation or sanitization; direct string interpolation of user-controlled data.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a download via curl and then opens a file. The use of os.system with interpolated 'file' parameter creates a command injection risk if 'file' contains malicious shell commands. The 'filename' parameter is used directly in os.start, which is less risky but still potentially exploitable if crafted maliciously. No obfuscation is present. The malware score should reflect the potential for malicious exploitation, which is high given the command injection vulnerability, but the code itself does not contain embedded malicious payloads. The security risk score is justified as high due to the command injection risk. Input validation and safer APIs are recommended to mitigate these issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is vulnerable to command injection due to unsanitized input in os.system, posing a high security risk. While no malicious payloads are embedded, the potential for exploitation is significant. The malware score should be increased to reflect this potential, and input validation should be implemented to mitigate risks.",
