  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static output only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward print statement with no inputs, dependencies, or dynamic behavior. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent and appropriate given the simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, posing no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
