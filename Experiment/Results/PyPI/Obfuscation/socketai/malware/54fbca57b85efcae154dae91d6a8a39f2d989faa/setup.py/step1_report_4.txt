  "purpose": "The code attempts to set up a Python package with metadata and installs dependencies if needed.",
  "sources": "Reading import statements, subprocess commands, and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "Executing PowerShell commands that download and run an external executable.",
  "flows": "Importing subprocess → running PowerShell command to download and execute external file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to download and execute a remote executable without validation; inconsistent exception handling; attempting to install 'subprocess' which is a standard library module and unnecessary.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by importing setup from distutils and then tries to import os and subprocess modules. If subprocess is not available, it attempts to install it via pip, which is redundant because subprocess is part of the Python standard library. The critical malicious behavior is the subprocess.run command that executes a PowerShell command to download an executable from a Dropbox URL and then execute it, which indicates potential malware activity. The executable URL is hardcoded, and the code runs it without any validation or user consent. The setup function is called afterward but is likely inconsequential compared to the malicious download and execution step.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable from a remote server, which is a strong indicator of malware. The initial setup code appears to be masking or obfuscating the true intent, but the core issue is the remote code execution. The script is highly suspicious and potentially harmful.",
