{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package using setuptools, including a custom install command.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description, and defines hard-coded string data and obfuscated code for execution.",
  "sinks": "The obfuscated code is compiled and executed via eval(compile(...)), which can be a source of malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "Data from the hard-coded strings is processed through XOR deobfuscation, then compiled and evaluated, executing potentially malicious code embedded in the obfuscated string.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated string that is decoded and executed dynamically using eval and compile; unusual variable naming; obfuscated code block in the install method. The obfuscation pattern suggests an attempt to hide malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily functions to set up a Python package, but it includes a suspicious obfuscated string that is processed through XOR decoding. The decoded string is then compiled and executed via eval(compile(...)), which is highly risky as it can run arbitrary code. This pattern is commonly used to hide malicious payloads, backdoors, or unauthorized behaviors. No other suspicious network connections or data leaks are evident outside this obfuscation. The rest of the code appears normal for a setup script, but the dynamic execution of decoded code is a major security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious intent hidden behind obfuscation. The use of XOR decoding followed by eval of the resulting code indicates an attempt to conceal malicious payloads or backdoors. This pattern poses a high security risk and suggests the package should not be trusted or installed.",
