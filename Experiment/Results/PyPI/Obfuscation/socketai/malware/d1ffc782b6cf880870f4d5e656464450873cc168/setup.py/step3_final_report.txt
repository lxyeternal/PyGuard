  "purpose": "Detects obfuscated code that decodes and executes arbitrary code during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated string variable, the hardcoded numeric string, and the XOR decoding loop within the custom install class method.",
  "sinks": "The eval(compile(...)) statement executing the decoded string as code.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated string -> XOR decoding -> eval(compile()) execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of meaningless variable names, obfuscated strings, XOR decoding, and dynamic execution of decoded code during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a heavily obfuscated string decoded via XOR with a numeric string, then executed with eval(compile()), which is a common pattern for malicious payloads. The obfuscation and dynamic execution are designed to hide malicious activities such as backdoors or data theft. All reports correctly identify these patterns, and their high malware and risk scores are justified by the code's behavior. The code's purpose appears malicious, and the obfuscation further supports this conclusion. No benign explanation aligns with such obfuscation and runtime code execution during package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits classic malicious obfuscation and dynamic code execution, indicating high probability of malicious intent. It should be flagged as malicious, and its use avoided. The high scores assigned in all reports are justified and consistent with the observed behavior.",
