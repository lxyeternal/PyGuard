  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, including a custom installation command.",
  "sources": "Reads from __file__ for file paths; reads README.md; defines obfuscated bytecode and string data.",
  "sinks": "Executes dynamically decoded and deobfuscated code via eval(compile(...)).",
  "flows": "Obfuscated string data is decoded through XOR, then compiled and executed with eval, forming a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated bytecode and string data, dynamic code execution via eval/compile, and use of XOR decoding suggest malicious intent or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration with package metadata. It also includes a custom install class that overrides a method, inside which there is an obfuscated string block and a lengthy string of digits. The code performs XOR decoding of the obfuscated string, then compiles and executes it dynamically via eval(compile(...)). This behavior indicates an attempt to conceal malicious code or payload. The XOR key varies based on the position in the string, implying an encoded malicious payload that is decoded at runtime, then executed. Such patterns are common in malicious supply chain code designed to run hidden or malicious operations during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically executed payload that strongly indicates malicious intent. The use of eval with decoded bytecode is a significant security concern, as it can conceal malicious operations. Therefore, this package is likely malicious or at least suspicious, and should be treated with high caution.",
