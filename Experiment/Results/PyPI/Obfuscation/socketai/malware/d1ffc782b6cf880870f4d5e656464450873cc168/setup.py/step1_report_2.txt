  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, including an installation command override. It appears to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the contents of 'README.md' and the hardcoded encrypted string 'XvwgNHtlGoXgdsFpKevxuQmhwgSSiYJh'.",
  "sinks": "The eval(compile(...)) call which executes dynamically decoded code; potential code execution sink.",
  "flows": "The code decodes an encrypted string into Python code, then executes it via eval(compile(...)), which is a direct source-to-sink flow that executes dynamically generated code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated strings and the use of eval(compile()) on decrypted data. The encrypted string and the XOR operation indicate attempts to hide code logic. The dynamic execution of decrypted code is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up a Python package with metadata and dependencies. However, within the custom install command, it contains an obfuscated string 'XvwgNHtlGoXgdsFpKevxuQmhwgSSiYJh' which is decrypted using an XOR-based method against a hardcoded key. This decrypted string is intended to be Python code that is then executed via eval(compile()). This pattern indicates malicious intent, as it is a common technique to hide malicious code or backdoors within seemingly benign setup scripts. The decrypted code is not directly visible but is likely malicious, considering the use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and the encrypted payload. The rest of the script does not contain any malicious operations; the suspicious activity is concentrated in the eval(compile()) call, which is a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, encrypted payloads that are decrypted and executed at install time, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent. This pattern is a common method for hiding malicious code within legitimate-looking setup scripts, potentially installing backdoors or executing arbitrary malicious code during package installation.",
