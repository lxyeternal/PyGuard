{
  "purpose": "Defines interface structures related to object wrapping and acquisition in a possibly obfuscated manner.",
  "sources": "Class and method definitions, attribute declarations with descriptive docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "None; purely interface declarations without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; assignment of a string to a variable not used elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of interface definitions with obfuscated names, lacking any executable logic, data handling, or network activity. Attributes are documented but not operational. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. Obfuscation appears to be in naming only, not in malicious intent. The static, structural nature of the code indicates low security risk and malware likelihood.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of interface declarations with obfuscated names, serving structural purposes without any malicious or security-threatening behavior. The obfuscation level is high but benign, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
