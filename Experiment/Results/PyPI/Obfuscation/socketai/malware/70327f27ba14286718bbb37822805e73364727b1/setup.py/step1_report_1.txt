{
  "purpose": "The code appears to modify the installation process of a Python package, with an intent to execute additional code during installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "Writing to a file and executing a downloaded file via os.system('start ...').",
  "flows": "Retrieves 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> Sends it as part of an HTTP request -> Downloads and executes a remote script or executable during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and class names; download and execution of remote code during install; use of broad try-except without handling exceptions; fetching and executing remote content without validation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to an external URL, potentially for tracking or malicious purposes. If running on Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it, which is a high-risk behavior. The class override hooks into the setup process, ensuring this code runs during package installation. The obfuscation and remote code execution are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by fetching and executing remote code during installation, which can compromise system security. It appears designed for clandestine remote control or malware distribution.",
