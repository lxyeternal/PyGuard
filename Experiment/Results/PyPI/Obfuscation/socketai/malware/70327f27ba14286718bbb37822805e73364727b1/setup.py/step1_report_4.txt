{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package setup process that includes a custom installation step which executes additional code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables ('COMPUTERNAME'), makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs, and reads/writes files during the installation process.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs (potential data exfiltration), executing downloaded files ('os.system'), writing files ('open().write'), and executing system commands.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> HTTP request to 'linkedopports.com' -> download and execute file from 'python-release.com' -> run downloaded file during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically downloads and executes an external script during installation without user consent, which is highly unusual and suspicious. It uses broad exception handling that suppresses errors, hiding potential failures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a custom install class that overrides the install command. During installation, it retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it via a GET request to a suspicious domain. If running on Windows, it downloads a file from a potentially malicious URL and executes it automatically. The URL and filename are obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names. The silent exception handling suppresses errors, making detection and troubleshooting difficult. This behavior strongly indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution or malware deployment, within an installation process.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing external payloads during package installation, which is highly suspicious and potentially harmful. It should be considered malicious or at least highly risky, and should not be used or trusted.",
