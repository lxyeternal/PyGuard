{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, sends it via HTTP GET to a remote server, and on Windows, downloads and executes an external executable during installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', HTTP GET requests to external URLs, file download and execution via os.system during setup.",
  "sinks": "Remote server receiving system info, executing downloaded payload, potential data exfiltration and remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Environment variable read -> HTTP request to exfiltrate data -> Download of executable -> Execution of payload during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function and class names, broad try-except blocks suppressing errors, execution of external payload during installation, suspicious URLs, no validation of downloaded content.",
  "analysis": "The code actively collects system info, exfiltrates it, downloads a malicious executable, and runs it during package installation, all behaviors characteristic of malware. Obfuscation and error suppression further conceal malicious intent. The URLs used are suspicious, and the code's actions pose a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing remote code download and execution, data exfiltration, and obfuscation. The high malware score of 1 and security risk score of 1 are justified. Obfuscation is present but not maximal, warranting a score of 0.8. Overall, the package should be flagged as malicious and avoided.",
