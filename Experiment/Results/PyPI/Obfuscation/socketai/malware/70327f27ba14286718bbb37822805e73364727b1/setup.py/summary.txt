  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing remote code download and execution, data exfiltration, and obfuscation. The high malware score of 1 and security risk score of 1 are justified. Obfuscation is present but not maximal, warranting a score of 0.8. Overall, the package should be flagged as malicious and avoided."
