{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it also executes potentially malicious actions during installation, such as downloading and executing external files and sending data to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', and the content downloaded from these URLs.",
  "sinks": "Downloading and writing files ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe'), executing the downloaded file via os.system, and sending HTTP GET requests with environment data.",
  "flows": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> Sends data via HTTP GET request -> Downloads an executable -> Saves it locally -> Executes the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes fetching an executable from a suspicious URL and automatically executing it during package installation, which is atypical and suspicious for a legitimate setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and requests, then defines a function that retrieves the machine's 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable. It sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain. On Windows systems, it proceeds to download an executable file from an external URL and executes it automatically. The class extends the install command, overriding the installation process to include this behavior. These actions suggest data exfiltration and remote code execution, indicative of malicious intent. The setup function is standard, but the embedded malicious code within the custom install command is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system data and executing a downloaded file during package installation. These actions are indicative of malicious activity, likely to compromise systems upon installation of this package.",
