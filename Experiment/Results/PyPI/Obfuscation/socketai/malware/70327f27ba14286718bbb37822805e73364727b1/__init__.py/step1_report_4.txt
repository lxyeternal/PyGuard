{
  "purpose": "The function prints a message indicating that something is installed.",
  "sources": "The function is called directly at the end of the code, which is a sink where code execution begins.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to the console using print(), which is generally benign and does not lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code executes the function QxciUwOEWRktDwYsKNCpqUinPnULxQut(), which then calls print(). There are no external data sources or untrusted inputs involved.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is obfuscated with a seemingly random string, but it performs a straightforward print statement. No other suspicious code or data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with a complex name that prints a message to the console. The function is immediately invoked. There are no inputs, data leaks, or malicious operations such as network activity, file manipulation, or system commands. The obfuscated function name may suggest an attempt to hide purpose, but the content is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple, benign print statement wrapped in an obfuscated function name. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
