{
  "purpose": "The code checks for the existence of the 'tahg' directory and, if absent, executes a hidden, encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen. It also defines package metadata with error suppression.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; execution of subprocess with encoded command",
  "sinks": "Execution of PowerShell command via subprocess, potentially leading to remote code execution or payload delivery",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers subprocess execution; encoded command runs silently with error suppression",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently; silent error handling; obfuscation; conditional execution based on filesystem state",
  "analysis": "The script performs a filesystem check for 'tahg'. If missing, it runs a subprocess executing a base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window style and no window creation flags, within a try-except block that suppresses errors. The setup function is wrapped in try-except, which is common in obfuscated or malicious scripts to hide failures. The encoded command's purpose is not decoded, but its obfuscation, stealth execution, and conditional trigger strongly suggest malicious intent, such as remote payload delivery or backdoor installation. The silent error handling further indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity. The overall pattern aligns with common supply chain attack tactics, making the behavior highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell payload conditioned on filesystem state. The silent error suppression and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting high security concern.",
