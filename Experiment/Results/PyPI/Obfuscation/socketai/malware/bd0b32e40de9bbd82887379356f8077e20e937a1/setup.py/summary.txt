  "security_risk": 0.85,

  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell command during setup. The high malware and risk scores are appropriate, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further payload analysis is performed."
