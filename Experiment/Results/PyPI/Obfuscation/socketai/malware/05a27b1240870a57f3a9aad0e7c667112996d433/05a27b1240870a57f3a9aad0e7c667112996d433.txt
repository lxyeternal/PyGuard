      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion for malicious behavior due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command execution during setup. While the exact payload is unknown, the pattern aligns with common malicious tactics in supply chain attacks. The silent error handling and obfuscation further support this assessment. It should be treated as potentially malicious and investigated further."
