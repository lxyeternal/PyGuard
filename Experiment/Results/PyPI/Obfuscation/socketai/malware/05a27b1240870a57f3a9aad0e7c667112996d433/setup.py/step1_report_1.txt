  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, with an attempt to execute hidden PowerShell commands during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the file system ('tahg' directory), executing a subprocess command with encoded PowerShell script.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution with encoded command, potential execution of arbitrary code via PowerShell.",
  "flows": "Code checks for 'tahg' directory -> executes encoded PowerShell command via subprocess if not exists.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command, use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window and no validation or decoding shown, silent try-except blocks hiding errors.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing setup tools and attempts to import subprocess and os modules. It checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists; if not, it executes a PowerShell command encoded in Base64 using subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags, which could be used to run arbitrary code without user detection. The command is highly obfuscated, indicating potential malicious intent, such as downloading or executing payloads. The setup function is called with standard parameters but within a try-except block that suppresses errors. The use of encoded commands and silent error handling are suspicious indicators, especially in a setup script where such behavior is uncommon and risky.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious indicators, notably the execution of an encoded PowerShell command with hidden window settings, which may be used to run arbitrary or malicious code during package installation. The use of silent try-except blocks further obscures potential malicious activity. Overall, this code poses a significant security risk due to the encoded, hidden execution of external commands.",
