      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicating potential malicious activity. The behavior aligns with common malware tactics such as payload delivery or backdoor installation. The high obfuscation and concealed execution warrant treating this code as malicious until further decoding and analysis of the PowerShell command."
