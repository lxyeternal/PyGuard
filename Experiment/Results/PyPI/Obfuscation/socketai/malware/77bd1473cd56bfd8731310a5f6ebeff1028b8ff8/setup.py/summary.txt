  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior: it silently executes an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup, likely to download and run malicious payloads. The high obfuscation and covert execution strongly suggest malicious intent, making this package unsafe for use or distribution."
