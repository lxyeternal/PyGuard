{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package and attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem (os.path.exists) and executes a subprocess with a PowerShell command encoded in Base64.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes an external PowerShell command with hidden window style, potentially executing malicious payload.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check (source) triggers execution of hidden PowerShell command (sink), which may perform malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded in Base64, which is often used to obfuscate malicious scripts. The command is executed with no visible window and lacks error handling; the command string appears suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions and attempts to run a PowerShell command if the 'tahg' directory does not exist. The command is encoded in Base64, likely to obfuscate its true intent. The command is executed in a hidden window, and the use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' is typical of attempts to run obfuscated or malicious code silently. The try-except blocks suppress errors, which could hide failures or malicious activities. No other code or logic indicates benign behavior; the key concern is the obfuscated PowerShell command that is executed without transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently, which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The rest of the script appears to be boilerplate setup code. Given the suspicious execution and obfuscation, this code is highly likely malicious or intended for malicious purposes.",
