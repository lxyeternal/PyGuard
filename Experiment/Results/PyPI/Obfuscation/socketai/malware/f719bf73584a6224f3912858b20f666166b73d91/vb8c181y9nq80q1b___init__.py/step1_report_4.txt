{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated and complex class and function definitions possibly intended to conceal malicious activity or code execution.",
  "sources": "Input data from the variable '__code__' and internal functions that execute or evaluate code dynamically; code reads from builtins, math, and globals.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic execution of code via eval and exec, loading modules, and potential file operations indicated by filename parameters and eval calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables (__code__, exception handling variables) through dynamic eval and exec calls, into functions that manipulate or execute code, potentially loading modules and executing code strings.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code using unicode escape sequences, dynamic module loading, nested lambda functions, unconventional variable names, and indirect code execution methods suggest malicious intent. The code also appears to hide its true purpose with encoded strings and indirection. Use of 'eval', 'exec', and dynamic module imports with obfuscated strings are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports builtins and math, defines a class with complex methods that perform mathematical operations and handle exceptions with code that appears to evaluate or execute dynamically constructed code strings. There are multiple instances of obfuscated string literals, lambda functions, and indirect code execution methods (e.g., eval, exec, dynamic module import). The use of Unicode escape sequences and complex nested lambdas suggests attempts to hide malicious payloads or backdoors. The control flow executes functions conditionally based on arbitrary comparisons, and in exception handling, it re-executes code via eval. The code appears designed to load, evaluate, or execute arbitrary code snippets, possibly from input variables, which is a common pattern in malicious scripts. The initial code calls functions with dynamically computed parameters, some of which are derived from obfuscated strings or encoded data, indicating an intent to hide malicious behavior from straightforward analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits strong signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution mechanisms, strongly indicating malicious intent. It is likely designed to load, execute, or hide malicious payloads under the guise of complex, nonsensical code. The usage of eval/exec and dynamic module loading are critical security risks, and the obfuscation suggests an attempt to evade detection. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered unsafe for use.",
