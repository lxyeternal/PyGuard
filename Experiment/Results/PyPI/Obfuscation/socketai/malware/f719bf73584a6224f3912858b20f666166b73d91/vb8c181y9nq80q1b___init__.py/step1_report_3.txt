{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated script executing complex, possibly malicious, dynamic code execution and manipulation.",
  "sources": "Data is read from obfuscated code blocks, dynamic imports, and global dictionaries. Inputs include string evaluations and exception details.",
  "sinks": "Uses exec, eval, dynamic imports, and potential network communication or file operations via heavily obfuscated code. Possible data exfiltration or remote code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources include obfuscated code and exception data. Flows lead to dynamic code execution, imports, and potential network/file operations via exec/eval and string manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code using hexadecimal, base64, and string encoding; complex lambda chains; dynamic import and eval; suspicious file handling and data flow patterns; unusual class and method names. Contains dynamic code evaluation and indirect data access.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated with hexadecimal string encoding, dynamic imports, and layered lambda functions that evaluate and execute code snippets. The use of eval and exec on obfuscated strings strongly indicates malicious intent, especially since code is generated or decoded at runtime. The exception handling re-invokes code with potentially malicious payloads. The logic involving comparison of large integers appears to control the flow of malicious actions or code execution paths. The presence of dynamic import ('zlib') and complex string manipulations suggests obfuscated, potentially harmful behavior. The code may attempt to execute arbitrary code, perform data exfiltration, or access system resources covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and indirect data manipulation, strongly indicating malicious intent. The use of eval, exec, and dynamic imports on encoded strings, combined with complex control flow, suggest potential malware designed for stealthy system or data compromise.",
