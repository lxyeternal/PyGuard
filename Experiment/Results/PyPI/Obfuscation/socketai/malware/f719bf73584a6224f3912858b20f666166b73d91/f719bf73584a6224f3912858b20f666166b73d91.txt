      "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated identifiers. No active malicious behavior is detected. The dependencies could be misused if exploited, but their presence alone does not constitute malicious activity. The obfuscation is mild, and the overall security risk is low."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and exhibits all hallmarks of malicious obfuscation and dynamic code execution. Given the heavy obfuscation, indirect code execution, and potential for payload delivery, it should be classified as malicious or at very high risk. It is unsafe to run or trust this package."
