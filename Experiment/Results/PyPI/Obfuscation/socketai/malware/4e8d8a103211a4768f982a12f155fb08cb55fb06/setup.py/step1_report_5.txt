  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python module 'uip2nnpysmseomgi', extracting version info, and possibly modifying source files.",
  "sources": "Reading '__version__' from 'QuickWebBasicAuth/__init__.py', opening and reading 'QuickWebBasicAuth/tmp.py', inspecting socket source file.",
  "sinks": "Writing to the source file of 'socket' module, reading 'tmp.py' content and writing it into socket's source file.",
  "flows": "Reading version -> Reading 'tmp.py' -> Writing 'tmp.py' content into socket source file",
  "anomalies": "The code writes the contents of 'QuickWebBasicAuth/tmp.py' directly into the socket module's source file, which is unusual and potentially malicious, as it could modify standard library files.",
  "analysis": "The script extracts version info from the package's __init__.py file. It then, if 'py_build' is not in environment variables, opens the socket module's source file and appends the contents of 'tmp.py' into it. This behavior is highly suspicious because it modifies a standard library module at runtime, which can introduce malicious code or backdoors. The code structure appears obfuscated or intentionally misleading, with misnamed variables and unusual formatting, possibly to hide malicious intent. No external network activity is observed, but the modification of standard library source files is a serious security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it modifies the socket module's source code by appending external data, which could be used to introduce malicious functionality or backdoors. This behavior indicates a high security risk and potential supply chain attack. The overall risk score is high, and the code should be considered unsafe for use.",
