  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates highly malicious behavior by modifying a core Python library file at runtime, indicating a severe supply chain attack. The high malware and security risk scores are justified, and the obfuscation supports malicious intent. Immediate action is recommended to mitigate potential system compromise."
