  "purpose": "Detect malicious behavior involving modification of core Python library files, specifically injecting code into the 'socket' module source, indicating a supply chain attack or sabotage.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'QuickWebBasicAuth/__init__.py'; reading 'socket' module source file via inspect.getsourcefile(socket); reading 'QuickWebBasicAuth/tmp.py' content.",
  "sinks": "Writing into the 'socket' module source file ('ab+' mode), injecting code from 'QuickWebBasicAuth/tmp.py'.",
  "flows": "Source: reading 'QuickWebBasicAuth/tmp.py' content; flow: open socket source file; sink: write the content into socket source file.",
  "anomalies": "Opening and appending to the 'socket' module source file at runtime; obfuscated package name 'uip2nnpysmseomgi'; nonsensical key 'dlUnwebWZhOLzMvSHjAlJcReKrswFlqc'; use of 'ab+' mode for writing into standard library source.",
  "analysis": "The code reads version info from '__init__.py' and conditionally writes the contents of 'QuickWebBasicAuth/tmp.py' into the source file of the 'socket' module using 'inspect.getsourcefile(socket)' in append-binary mode ('ab+'). This operation modifies a core Python standard library file at runtime, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent, such as injecting backdoors or malicious hooks. The package name appears obfuscated, and the key used is nonsensical, supporting malicious obfuscation. The high likelihood of malicious activity is confirmed by the nature of the file modification, which can lead to persistent backdoors, data leaks, or system compromise. All reports correctly identify this behavior, assigning high malware scores (~0.9 to 1.0) and security risk scores (~0.9 to 1.0). The obfuscation scores are also appropriate given the package name and variable naming. The overall assessment indicates a severe supply chain attack vector, warranting immediate removal and investigation.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates highly malicious behavior by modifying a core Python library file at runtime, indicating a severe supply chain attack. The high malware and security risk scores are justified, and the obfuscation supports malicious intent. Immediate action is recommended to mitigate potential system compromise.",
