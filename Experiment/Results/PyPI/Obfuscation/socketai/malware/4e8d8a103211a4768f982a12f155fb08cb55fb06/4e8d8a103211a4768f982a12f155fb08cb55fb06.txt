      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates highly malicious behavior by modifying a core Python library file at runtime, indicating a severe supply chain attack. The high malware and security risk scores are justified, and the obfuscation supports malicious intent. Immediate action is recommended to mitigate potential system compromise."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign logging configuration with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. The obfuscation appears stylistic or for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation of Flask Basic Authentication with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The high obfuscation score reflects naming obfuscation but does not imply malicious intent. Overall security risk is minimal."
