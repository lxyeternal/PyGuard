      "conclusion": "The script is malicious, intended for SMS bombing and OTP abuse across multiple platforms. It uses obfuscation and hardcoded endpoints to hide its activity, posing a high security risk. The malware score is set to 1, and the risk score is also 1, with obfuscation around 0.8 due to variable name complexity. The overall activity is highly dangerous and should be flagged for review or takedown."
