  "conclusion": "The script contains suspicious behavior indicative of malicious activity, primarily due to the obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command executed conditionally. The high obfuscation and silent execution strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting further decoding of the payload to confirm its purpose. Scores assigned in the reports are justified; I recommend treating this code as malicious until payload analysis confirms otherwise."
