  "purpose": "Import a class or function from a third-party module and invoke it with a boolean argument",
  "sources": "Import statement from module.pytoolib, passing a boolean argument to the imported callable",
  "sinks": "Invocation of the imported function with a boolean value",
  "flows": "Import from module.pytoolib -> function call with boolean argument",
  "anomalies": "The module name and class/function name appear obfuscated or randomly generated, which could indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code calls an imported entity without any input validation or context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a potentially obscure or maliciously named component from 'module.pytoolib' and immediately calls it with the argument 'boolean'. The lack of context for what 'IUOCZmJRhWyhkGhhqjbRabLbYKuKHuWK' does makes it difficult to assess its purpose. Obfuscated names and the direct invocation suggest possible malicious behavior, such as executing hidden payloads or backdoors. No other code or data sources are involved. The code is minimal but suspicious due to its obfuscated identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears suspicious due to the obfuscated import name and direct function call, which could be a concealment tactic for malicious behavior. However, with only this snippet, the precise intent is unclear, but it warrants caution and further review.",
