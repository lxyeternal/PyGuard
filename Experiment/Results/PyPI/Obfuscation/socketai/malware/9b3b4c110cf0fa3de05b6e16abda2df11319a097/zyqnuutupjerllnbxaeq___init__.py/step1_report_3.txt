{
  "purpose": "Import and invoke a function from an obscure module, possibly for data processing or configuration.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'module.pytoolib' and the function call 'IUOCZmJRhWyhkGhhqjbRabLbYKuKHuWK('boolean')'.",
  "sinks": "The function call potentially processes or outputs data, but no explicit data sinks like network or file operations are shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the import of 'IUOCZmJRhWyhkGhhqjbRabLbYKuKHuWK' to its invocation with the argument 'boolean'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated or nonsensical module and function name, which could indicate hiding malicious intent or obfuscation. The function name and imported module appear intentionally obscure. No clear documentation or context provided.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from an apparently obscure module with a nonsensical name and immediately calls it with a string argument 'boolean'. There are no other operations, no input handling, and no visible data leaks or network activity. The obscurity of the module and function name raises suspicion about hidden behavior, but no explicit malicious actions are evident in this fragment. The function's behavior is unknown, which limits certainty. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system modifications are apparent from the code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to import and invoke a function with an opaque name, which could be an attempt at obfuscation or hiding malicious intent. However, based solely on this fragment, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The main concern is the obscure naming, which warrants caution, but no definitive malicious activity is observed.",
