  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python code snippet for potential malicious behavior, supply chain risks, and obfuscation concerns.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'pytoolib' and the function call with static argument 'boolean'.",
  "sinks": "The function call potentially executes code or performs actions based on the imported entity; no explicit sinks like network or file operations are visible.",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated entity -> invocation with static string 'boolean'.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import name 'IUOCZmJRhWyhkGhhqjbRabLbYKuKHuWK', minimal context, static argument, and obscure module name 'pytoolib'.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an entity with a nonsensical, obfuscated name from 'pytoolib' and calls it with a static string. No evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification is present. The obfuscation and minimal context raise suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent. The scores across reports reflect cautious suspicion, with high obfuscation scores (~0.75) and low malware scores (~0.2). The overall risk remains moderate (~0.4), primarily due to obfuscation. Further investigation into the implementation of the imported entity in 'pytoolib' is recommended to determine if malicious behavior exists.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation that warrants caution but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. The suspicion is primarily due to the obfuscated naming and minimal context. The current scores are appropriate; further analysis of the 'pytoolib' library is necessary to confirm or refute malicious intent.",
