{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious script designed to steal various types of sensitive user data, including cookies, passwords, browser info, Discord tokens, and files from user systems, then exfiltrate this data to remote servers or via webhooks.",
  "sources": "Input data is gathered from environment variables, local files (browsers' local storage, cookies, local state files, wallet files), and network requests (IP address, geolocation, Discord API endpoints). Data flows include reading browser storage, database files, and user files on the system.",
  "sinks": "Exfiltration occurs via HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks, Gofile upload service, and remote servers. Data is written to temporary files, zipped, and sent over the network. Also, external processes are terminated and files copied, suggesting further data collection or manipulation.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data from cookies, passwords, Discord tokens, user files, and system info (IP, geolocation) are collected from various local paths and databases, then sent through HTTP requests or saved into ZIP archives for exfiltration. Certain functions decrypt encrypted data, indicating de-obfuscation of sensitive info before transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The script installs modules without verification, kills processes (e.g., browser, wallet, Steam, Riot), copies browser database files, extracts tokens and passwords, and uploads data anonymously. It contains multiple obfuscated variable names, dynamic thread creation for parallel processing, and attempts to collect a wide array of user information, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated with random variable names and nested function calls that perform malicious activities like stealing cookies, passwords, and files, decrypting encrypted data, collecting Discord tokens, and system info. It attempts to exfiltrate data via webhooks and upload services. The code kills processes related to browsers and wallets, copies relevant files, and encrypts/decrypts data for extraction. Overall, the script demonstrates typical traits of malware used for espionage and credential theft, with no legitimate purpose evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a highly malicious, stealthy credential stealer targeting browsers, wallets, and communication apps. It exfiltrates sensitive user data to remote servers and Discord webhooks, disables security measures by killing processes, and obfuscates its behavior. The overall security risk is extremely high. It should be considered dangerous and unsuitable for use.",
