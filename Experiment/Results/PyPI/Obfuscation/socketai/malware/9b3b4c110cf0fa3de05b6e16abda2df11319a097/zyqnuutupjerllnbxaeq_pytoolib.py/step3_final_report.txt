{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious credential and data stealer, targeting browsers, wallets, gaming, and messaging applications. It decrypts stored passwords, cookies, tokens, and personal data, then exfiltrates this information via webhooks and file uploads. It also terminates security and related processes to disable protections.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, local application data directories, browser storage files, logs, database files, network responses for IP/geolocation, and local system files.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Discord webhooks and external servers, file writing and zipping of stolen data, process termination commands, and concurrent data collection routines.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local files, environment variables, and system info; decrypted or parsed; then transmitted via network requests or stored in archives for exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with cryptic variable names, dynamic dependency installation, cryptography routines, process termination commands, multi-threaded data harvesting, and hardcoded webhook URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits complex behaviors typical of malware: it accesses sensitive data, decrypts stored credentials, kills security-related processes, and exfiltrates data via webhooks and uploads. The heavy obfuscation and threading further suggest malicious intent. Functions decrypt stored passwords and cookies, gather system info, and manage concurrent data exfiltration routines. The presence of hardcoded URLs, process kills, and cryptography routines confirm malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a highly malicious, obfuscated info stealer actively collecting and exfiltrating user credentials, cookies, tokens, and system data. It employs cryptography, process management, and network exfiltration techniques typical of malware. Its behavior justifies a malware score of 1.0, obfuscation score around 0.8, and security risk score of 1.0.",
