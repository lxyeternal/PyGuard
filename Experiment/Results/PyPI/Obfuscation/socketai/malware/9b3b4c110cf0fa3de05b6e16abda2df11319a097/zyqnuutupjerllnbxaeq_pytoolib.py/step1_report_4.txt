{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for extracting sensitive user data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, and other personal information from various browsers, applications, and games, then exfiltrating this data to a remote server or webhook, indicating malicious intent typical of a stealer or info-stealer malware.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, local files (browser storage, login data, local state, cookies, leveldb directories), and inputs from system directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It also reads configuration files and local database files related to browsers, wallet applications, gaming platforms, and messaging apps.",
  "sinks": "Exfiltration functions via HTTP POST requests to remote URLs, including Discord webhooks and file uploads to third-party servers (gofile.io). It also executes commands to kill processes, copy and read database files, zip collected data, and delete source files, which can lead to data leakage and system disruption.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system directories and files (sources) into local memory structures, then is processed (e.g., decryption, parsing). Collected data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, and sensitive files are then sent over network connections to external servers or uploaded via APIs, such as Discord webhooks or file upload services.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated or confusing variable names, redundant or inconsistent code snippets, use of threads for parallel execution, and functions with names and structures suggesting data collection and exfiltration. The code downloads and installs modules silently, kills processes, zips files, and manipulates data with little validation, all signs of malicious behavior. Use of certain strings (e.g., 'nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn') corresponds to known malicious extension IDs. The code also contains placeholders and malformed segments, indicating obfuscation or incomplete de-obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing numerous modules, including system, network, cryptography, and threading libraries, often used for data collection and manipulation. It attempts to install missing modules silently. It defines various functions for network communication, encryption/decryption, process management, file handling, and data collection from browsers, wallets, and applications. It specifically targets browser storage for passwords, cookies, local states, and wallet data, as well as gaming and messaging platform files. The code constructs detailed data reports and exfiltrates them via Discord webhooks and file uploads. Multiple threads are used to parallelize data collection, indicating an emphasis on efficiency. The code includes functions to zip and encrypt data, kill processes, and remove files, which are typical behaviors of malware aiming to avoid detection and maintain persistence. Overall, the code demonstrates comprehensive data harvesting and exfiltration mechanisms, characteristic of malicious stealer malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, designed to extract sensitive user data from various sources and transmit it to external servers or services. Its obfuscated variable names, use of threading for data collection, silent module installation, process termination, and data exfiltration strongly suggest malicious intent typical of information-stealing malware or trojans. The overall security risk score is high, and this package should be considered dangerous and should not be used.",
