{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for stealing sensitive user information, including tokens, cookies, passwords, and files from various applications and browsers, and then exfiltrating this data to a remote server or Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents), browser and application data folders, local database files, and local system files like login credentials and cookies.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent to remote URLs via POST requests, Discord webhooks, and file uploads to external servers. It also executes system commands to kill processes and create zip archives of stolen data.",
  "flows": "Sources such as local data files, environment variables, and user directories flow into functions that extract, decrypt, and process sensitive data. This data then flows into network requests (webhooks, uploads) or file writes for exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names, dynamic process termination, copying and zipping of user data, and sending data to Discord webhooks indicate malicious intent. Extensive threading for concurrent operations and repeated use of cryptographic functions for decrypting stored data are suspicious. The code also kills specific processes (e.g., browser, wallet, steam) and copies sensitive files, indicative of malicious data theft activities.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as a sophisticated information stealer targeting multiple applications, browsers, and cryptocurrency wallets. It includes functions for decrypting stored passwords and tokens, collecting browser data, capturing cookies, and processing files. It uses obfuscated variable names and dynamic process management, which are typical in malware to avoid detection. The code exfiltrates data to external servers via webhooks and file uploads, and creates zip archives of user data. Multiple threads are used to perform concurrent data collection tasks, increasing stealth and efficiency. The presence of process termination commands for browsers and wallets suggests an intent to disable security or anti-malware tools. Overall, the script is clearly malicious, aiming to harvest sensitive user data stealthily and transmit it externally.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info-stealer targeting user credentials, tokens, cookies, files, and system data. It employs obfuscation, multithreading, and process management to evade detection and maximize data theft. Its activities—data collection, encryption handling, process termination, and data exfiltration—are characteristic of malware designed for cybercrime or unauthorized surveillance.",
