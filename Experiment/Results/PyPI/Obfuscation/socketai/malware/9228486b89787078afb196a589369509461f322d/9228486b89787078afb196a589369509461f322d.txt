      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external binary without validation. The obfuscated variable names and suspicious URL reinforce malicious intent. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified. This package should be considered unsafe and flagged for removal or further review."

The scores should reflect maximum malware and security risk levels, with a low obfuscation score due to minimal obfuscation in variable naming."
