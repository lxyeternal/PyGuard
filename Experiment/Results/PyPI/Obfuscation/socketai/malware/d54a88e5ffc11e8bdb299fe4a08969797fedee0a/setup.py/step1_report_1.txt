  "purpose": "Custom installation script that sends environment variables to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ.items(), network request to external server using requests.post().",
  "sinks": "Data sent over network to 'https://a5gpivpedls2wjfxl0bm6dmwenke84wt.oastify.com', potentially leaking environment variables.",
  "flows": "os.environ.items() -> requests.post() -> external server. The environment variables are transmitted during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Code is obfuscated with nonsensical class and method names. The code sends environment variables without user consent or transparency. No input validation or user notification.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of the 'install' command that, during installation, collects all environment variables and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious external URL. The class and method names appear intentionally obfuscated. The request includes all environment variables, which could contain sensitive information. The network communication occurs automatically during package installation without user awareness. The response handling is minimal, only printing success or failure. The code structure indicates malicious intent to exfiltrate environment data.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables during package installation to an external server, likely without user consent. The obfuscation and network activity suggest malicious intent.",
