  "purpose": "Custom setup script that sends environment variables to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "os.environ.items() (reads environment variables), requests.post (sends data over network)",
  "sinks": "requests.post to external URL ('https://a5gpivpedls2wjfxl0bm6dmwenke84wt.oastify.com')",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> requests.post -> External server",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, unconventional method naming, sending environment variables during install, hardcoded external URL, no clear legitimate reason for data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, when executed, imports requests and gathers environment variables. It then sends these variables as JSON payload to a suspicious external server. The class and method names are obfuscated, suggesting an attempt to hide malicious intent. Sending environment variables during installation is suspicious, as it could leak sensitive info. The script does not perform any other benign task related to setup; instead, it exfiltrates data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears malicious, as it secretly transmits environment variables to an external server during package installation, which could be used for data exfiltration. The obfuscation and unusual behavior strongly suggest malicious intent.",
