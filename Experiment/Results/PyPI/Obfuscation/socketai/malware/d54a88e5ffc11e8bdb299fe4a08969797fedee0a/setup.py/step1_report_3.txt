  "purpose": "Custom installation command that sends environment variables to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ.items()",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to external server with environment data",
  "flows": "os.environ.items() -> requests.post() to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Code uses obfuscated class and method names, which is suspicious; sends environment variables to a suspicious domain during installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class inheriting from setuptools' install. During installation, it imports requests and collects all environment variables into a dictionary with obfuscated keys and values. It then posts this data to a potentially malicious domain 'a5gpivpedls2wjfxl0bm6dmwenke84wt.oastify.com'. It logs success or failure based on the HTTP response. The obfuscated naming and the act of exfiltrating environment variables at install time suggest malicious intent or at least malicious behavior. This behavior could be used for data harvesting or tracking without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates environment variables to an external server during package installation, indicating malicious intent. The obfuscation and external data transfer are suspicious, and this behavior constitutes a security risk.",
