  "purpose": "Custom installation command that sends environment variables to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via os.environ.items() and the requests.post() call to a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "Requests.post() to an external URL with environment data, potential for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (source) are collected and sent via POST request to the remote server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; the code actively transmits environment data without explicit user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom 'install' command that, upon execution, imports requests, gathers all environment variables, and sends them via a POST request to a suspicious URL. The response is checked; success or failure is printed. The use of obfuscated class/method names and active data exfiltration suggests malicious intent or at least malicious-like behavior. No other malicious actions like system damage or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for covertly collecting and transmitting environment variables during package installation, indicating malicious or privacy-intrusive behavior. The obfuscation and active data transmission raise security concerns.",
