  "purpose": "Decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it via exec(), likely to run obfuscated malicious code.",
  "sources": "Base64 string decoding, exec() function executing decoded code",
  "sinks": "exec() executing arbitrary code, network modules (socket, ssl), subprocess calls",
  "flows": "Decoding base64 string then passing it to exec() for execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding combined with exec() for dynamic code execution, obfuscation pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules like setuptools, then decodes a base64 string which, when decoded, contains obfuscated Python code importing socket, ssl, subprocess, and performing network operations. The use of exec() on this decoded payload indicates malicious intent, as it can execute arbitrary code, establish network connections, or backdoors. The obfuscation via base64 and dynamic execution hinders static analysis and is characteristic of malicious scripts. The decoded code's behavior suggests activities such as connecting to remote IPs, potentially exfiltrating data or establishing backdoors. The high obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly imply malicious behavior, justified by the decoded payload's network activity and code structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, employing obfuscation and dynamic code execution to conceal potentially harmful payloads. The decoded payload's network operations and obfuscation techniques justify a high malware score (~0.9), obfuscation score (~0.9), and security risk (~0.9). It should be treated as malicious, and further analysis or removal is recommended.",
