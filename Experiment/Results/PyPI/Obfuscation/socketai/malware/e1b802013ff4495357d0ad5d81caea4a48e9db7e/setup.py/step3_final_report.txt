  "purpose": "A static setup script using setuptools with an obfuscated package name and common dependencies, no malicious code present.",
  "sources": "Static code defining package metadata, dependencies, and package directory.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input or data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated package name 'y4su4peutxgo9lc3', which is suspicious but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static setup script with no dynamic code, external data, or malicious payloads. The package name is obfuscated, raising suspicion, but no malicious behavior is evident. Dependencies are common Python packages. No code injection, data leakage, or network activity is present. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and risk scores should remain low given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with an obfuscated package name. No malicious activity is detected. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion due to the package name, but overall, the package poses minimal security risk.",
