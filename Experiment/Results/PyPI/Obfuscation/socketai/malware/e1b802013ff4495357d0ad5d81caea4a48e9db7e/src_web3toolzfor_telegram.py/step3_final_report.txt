{
  "purpose": "The code checks for Telegram session data, copies it to a temporary directory, zips it, and exfiltrates it to an external server via a base64-decoded URL, indicating malicious data theft.",
  "sources": "Reading the existence of the Telegram 'tdata' directory, opening the zip file for reading.",
  "sinks": "Uploading the zip file to an external server via HTTP POST request.",
  "flows": "Code checks for 'tdata' directory -> copies it -> creates zip archive -> reads zip file -> sends data via POST request to decoded URL.",
  "anomalies": "Base64-encoded URL obfuscation, silent error handling during file operations, no user consent or notification, copying entire session data directory.",
  "analysis": "The script performs covert collection of Telegram session data by copying the 'tdata' directory, compressing it, and uploading it to an external server decoded from a base64 string. Error handling is silent, which may hide failures. The URL is obfuscated, indicating intent to conceal malicious activity. The behavior aligns with data exfiltration malware, with no benign purpose evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive user data to an external server. Obfuscation and silent errors support malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score is justified at 0.9.",
