{
  "purpose": "The code appears to copy user Telegram session data and upload it to an external server, likely for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists() checks the Telegram data directory; open() reads the zip file containing the session data.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sends the zipped session data to an external URL, potentially leaking sensitive user information.",
  "flows": "The code copies the session data directory to a temp folder -> zips the data -> reads the zip file -> uploads it to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded URL in base64, copying potentially sensitive session data without user consent, and automatic uploading of data without clear user knowledge.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by decoding a URL from base64, which is used as the target for data exfiltration. It checks for the Telegram session data directory, copies it to a temporary location, creates a zip archive of that data, then reads the zip file and uploads it via HTTP POST to the decoded URL. The process involves copying potentially sensitive user data and transmitting it externally, indicating malicious intent. The code handles errors silently, possibly to avoid detection or crash reports. The base64-encoded URL suggests obfuscation, and the overall behavior resembles data theft malware. No other benign functionality or user interaction is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to exfiltrate Telegram session data without user consent, indicating clear malicious intent. It uses obfuscation and silent error handling to avoid detection. The overall security risk is high.",
