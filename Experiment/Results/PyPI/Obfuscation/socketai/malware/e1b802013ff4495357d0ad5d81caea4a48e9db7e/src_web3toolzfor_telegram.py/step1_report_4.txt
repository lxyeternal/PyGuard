{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect and archive Telegram Desktop session data and upload it to an external server, likely for unauthorized data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads Telegram session data from '%APPDATA%\\Telegram Desktop\\tdata' directory and the local temporary zip file.",
  "sinks": "Uploads the archived session data via an HTTP POST request to a remote server, potentially exfiltrating sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Checks for Telegram session data -> copies data to temp folder -> creates a zip archive -> reads the zip file -> sends it over HTTP POST to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64 decoding to obfuscate the target URL, copies entire session data without validation, and immediately uploads without user consent. The URL decoded points to an external server. No error handling or user notification present.",
  "analysis": "The script first decodes a URL, which appears to be an external server address. It then verifies the existence of Telegram session data, copies it to a temporary directory, compresses it into a zip archive, and uploads it via a POST request. The use of base64 encoding to obscure the URL and the collection of session data for transfer strongly suggests malicious intent, likely data theft. Error handling is minimal, and the process runs silently, increasing suspicion. The code lacks any user consent or indication of legitimate functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to exfiltrate Telegram session data to a remote server without user knowledge, indicating malicious intent. It uses obfuscation techniques to hide its purpose, and the data flow is indicative of spyware or data-stealing malware.",
