  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate suspicion. While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the potential for concealment warrants cautious scoring. The malware score is increased slightly from 0.2 to 0.3 to better reflect this risk. The overall security posture should be monitored further if more code details emerge."
