  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, dynamic execution functions (eval, exec), obfuscated variable names, hardcoded strings, network calls.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variable access, system commands, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or obfuscated code flow into sinks like network or file operations, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation (high obfuscated score 0.7), dynamic code execution, misleading variable names, unusual imports, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code shows significant obfuscation and dynamic execution signs, which elevate suspicion. No direct malicious actions are confirmed, but obfuscation can conceal malicious intent. The malware score is set at 0.3 to reflect moderate concern. The obfuscated score remains high at 0.7, consistent with the signs of obfuscation. The security risk score is moderate at 0.4, considering the potential for malicious activity. The overall confidence is 0.8, given the suspicion but lack of definitive malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate suspicion. While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the potential for concealment warrants cautious scoring. The malware score is increased slightly from 0.2 to 0.3 to better reflect this risk. The overall security posture should be monitored further if more code details emerge.",
