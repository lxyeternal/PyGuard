  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a standard Python script designed to perform a specific function, potentially related to data processing or network communication.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, user inputs via command line, or external files. Exact sources are not explicitly visible in the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls (e.g., HTTP requests), file writes, or system commands. Specific sink functions are not identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs) through function calls or data processing steps. Due to the lack of explicit data flow in the snippet, detailed flow analysis is limited.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns are evident. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior. It uses standard Python constructs without suspicious imports or behaviors. Absence of external communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor indicators suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious anomalies detected. However, due to limited context, this assessment assumes standard code without hidden behaviors.",
