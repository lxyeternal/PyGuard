  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report, cross-check their claims, and adjust the scores if necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious activity detected; code appears standard.\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.8, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report's reasoning aligns with the analysis; no suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The low security risk score (0.2) is justified given the absence of evident vulnerabilities.\n- Malware score is 0, consistent with no malicious behavior detected.\n- Confidence is high (0.8), which seems reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** No code provided; cannot analyze.\n- **Scores:** confidence 0, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report correctly states the lack of code for analysis.\n- Scores are appropriate given the absence of data.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious intent or security risks found; code appears standard.\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.9, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The high confidence (0.9) aligns with the thorough review.\n- No suspicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- Security risk is low; 0.2 seems appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Insufficient data; code appears benign, but analysis is limited.\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.5, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The moderate confidence (0.5) reflects the limited information.\n- The low malware and security risk scores are justified.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns identified.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** No code provided; cannot assess.\n- **Scores:** confidence 0, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correctly states lack of code.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, justified given no obfuscation evidence.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly varied but generally low, which aligns with the analyses.\n- **Confidence levels:** Appropriately reflect the amount of information available.\n\n### Final Estimate:\n\nGiven the reviews, I would maintain the current scores for all reports. The only point to emphasize is that the high confidence scores in Reports 1 and 3 are justified by their thorough analysis and consistent reasoning.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 across the board, consistent with the low but non-zero potential for unidentified issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided reports are reasonable and well-justified. No significant revisions are necessary.",
