  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a basic script that imports modules, performs some data processing, and outputs results. No clear purpose indicating malicious intent is evident.",
  "sources": "Input sources include any user inputs, environment variables, or external files read within the code. In this code, no explicit data input sources are identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions, network connections, or system modifications. The code writes to console or files, but no suspicious sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flow from inputs (if any) to outputs, with processing steps in between. No unusual or suspicious flow paths are detected; data processing appears standard.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are observed. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "A step-by-step review shows standard imports, no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The code performs typical data operations and output. There are no signs of data leakage, insecure operations, or malicious behaviors. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign script with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
