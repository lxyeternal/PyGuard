  "purpose": "Assess the open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code input, dynamic execution points ('exec', 'eval'), network activity, hardcoded credentials, suspicious patterns",
  "sinks": "Network connections, data leakage points, environment variables, file system modifications",
  "flows": "Sources such as hardcoded credentials or network activity leading to potential data exfiltration or malicious payload execution",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, potential data leakage, obfuscation, dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The reports consistently identify no malicious activity in Reports 1-3 and 5, with appropriate low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 4 highlights suspicious patterns like hardcoded credentials and network activity, suggesting moderate concern. Given the evidence, a malware score of approximately 0.4-0.5 is justified for Report 4, with a security risk around 0.55. The confidence levels align with the certainty of findings. No evidence indicates confirmed active malware, but patterns warrant cautious monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate benign code with low risk; Report 4 presents moderate suspicion due to patterns like hardcoded credentials and network activity. A malware score of 0.4-0.5 and security risk of 0.55 are appropriate, reflecting moderate concern without confirmed malicious payloads.",
