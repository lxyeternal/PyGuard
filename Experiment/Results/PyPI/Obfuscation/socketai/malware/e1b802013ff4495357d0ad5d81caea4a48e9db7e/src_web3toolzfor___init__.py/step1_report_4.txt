{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or utility functions, but the exact purpose cannot be determined without further context.",
  "sources": "Input is read from environment variables and possibly user inputs via input() functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur through network connections or file writes; specific sinks are not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or user inputs through processing functions, potentially reaching output functions or network connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious backdoors are immediately apparent. The code uses dynamic features like eval() or exec(), which could be risky if untrusted data is involved, but such usage is not explicitly shown.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step review of the code did not reveal any malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or embedded malware. Usage of third-party libraries is standard, and no obfuscated code segments are detected. The code performs typical data handling tasks with no unusual patterns or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evident malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet. However, due to limited context and potential for hidden behavior elsewhere, confidence is moderate.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
