  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "No code present; analysis based on descriptions and absence of code snippets.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; no untrusted data flows identified due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; code absent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; absence of code prevents identification of suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly acknowledge the absence of code, leading to the conclusion that no malicious activity or obfuscation can be inferred. The assigned malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. Risk scores are conservatively low (0.2–0.3), reflecting cautious uncertainty due to lack of concrete evidence. Confidence levels are moderate to high, consistent with the absence of code. Minor adjustments to risk scores for Reports 3 and 4 from 0.3 and 0.25 down to 0.2 improve internal consistency, as higher scores imply suspicion not supported by data.",
  "conclusion": "Given the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The low risk scores and zero malware/obfuscated scores are justified. Minor adjustments to risk scores for Reports 3 and 4 enhance consistency. Overall, the security posture remains very low risk, with assessments aligned with the available information.",
