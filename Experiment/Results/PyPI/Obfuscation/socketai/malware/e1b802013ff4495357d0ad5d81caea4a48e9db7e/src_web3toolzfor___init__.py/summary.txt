  "conclusion": "Given the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The low risk scores and zero malware/obfuscated scores are justified. Minor adjustments to risk scores for Reports 3 and 4 enhance consistency. Overall, the security posture remains very low risk, with assessments aligned with the available information."
