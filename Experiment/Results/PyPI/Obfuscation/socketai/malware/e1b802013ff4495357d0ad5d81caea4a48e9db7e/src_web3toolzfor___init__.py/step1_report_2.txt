  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script that performs a specific task, but without seeing the actual code, the purpose cannot be precisely determined.",
  "sources": "Data sources include input functions, environment variables, or external data fetched from network or files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are system commands, network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through various processing functions or logic, potentially involving untrusted input manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies observed without code. Look for hardcoded credentials, obfuscated sections, or suspicious API calls.",
  "analysis": "Step 1: Review initial code for data input methods. Step 2: Check for use of untrusted data in sensitive operations. Step 3: Identify any network or system commands. Step 4: Search for suspicious patterns or obfuscation. Step 5: Assess if code performs malicious actions like data exfiltration or backdoor creation. Without actual code, a detailed line-by-line analysis isn't possible, but these are the key focus areas.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to definitively identify malicious behavior without the actual code content. No obvious malicious patterns or anomalies are evident based on the provided snippet.",
