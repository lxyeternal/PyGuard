  "conclusion": "The code in Report 1 demonstrates signs of obfuscation and suspicious network activity, indicating likely malicious behavior with high confidence. Other reports lack code or show benign patterns, justifying low suspicion. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, with Report 1 warranting a malware score of 0.6, obfuscation 0.7, and security risk 0.75."
