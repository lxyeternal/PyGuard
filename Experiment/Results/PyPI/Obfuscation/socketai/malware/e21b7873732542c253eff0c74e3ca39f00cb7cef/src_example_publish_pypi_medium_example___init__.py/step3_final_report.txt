  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network communication, dynamic execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network exfiltration, file modification, environment variable access, dynamic eval/exec.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., environment variables, network data) to sinks like network sockets, file system, eval/exec.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, hardcoded secrets/IPs, dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, inconsistent code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation (e.g., encoded strings, dynamic eval), suspicious data flows (sending data over network), hardcoded credentials/IPs, and dynamic execution routines. These signals suggest potential malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or backdoor access. The presence of obfuscation and suspicious network activity justifies high malware and security risk scores. Lack of code or benign code results in low scores. The analysis aligns with the scores assigned, with Report 1 showing justified suspicion and others appropriately low.",
  "conclusion": "The code in Report 1 demonstrates signs of obfuscation and suspicious network activity, indicating likely malicious behavior with high confidence. Other reports lack code or show benign patterns, justifying low suspicion. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, with Report 1 warranting a malware score of 0.6, obfuscation 0.7, and security risk 0.75.",
