{
  "purpose": "Return the version of the installed scikit-learn library",
  "sources": "Importing the sklearn module; accessing sklearn.__version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or output externally",
  "flows": "Import sklearn -> retrieve sklearn.__version__",
  "anomalies": "Unusually long and complex function name without clear purpose; no apparent malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sklearn library and defines a function with a very long, obscure name that returns the version of sklearn. There are no other data sources, sinks, or flows. The code does not perform any network communication, data processing, or malicious actions. The function appears to be a benign utility for retrieving library version info, possibly obfuscated in naming but otherwise straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely to return the scikit-learn version. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
