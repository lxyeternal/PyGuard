  "anomalies": "Obfuscated, unusually long function name; no malicious code or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing sklearn and returning its version. The function name is obfuscated but does not impact security. No external communication, data processing, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation is mild and likely intended for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a simple utility purpose. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The obfuscated function name is a minor concern but not malicious.",
