  "purpose": "Returns the version of the sklearn library installed in the environment.",
  "sources": "The import statement for sklearn; the function accessing sklearn.__version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Importing sklearn (source), then returning sklearn.__version__ (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated or intentionally nonsensical; no other unusual code behaviors or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sklearn library and defines a function with an obscure name that simply returns the library's version number. There is no data input, no external network activity, no use of environment variables, and no other suspicious operations. The function's purpose appears benign and straightforward, with no indicators of malicious intent or obfuscation beyond the odd function name.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility to retrieve sklearn's version. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity detected.",
