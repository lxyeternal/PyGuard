{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to retrieve and return the version number of the installed sklearn library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the sklearn module, specifically accessing the __version__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports sklearn, then directly returns its __version__ attribute; no untrusted data flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated and nonsensical, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known library, sklearn, and defines a function that returns its version number. The function name is intentionally obfuscated, which may be suspicious, but the code itself performs a benign action. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code is straightforward and limited in scope.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply retrieves and returns the version of the sklearn library. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscated function name could be a red flag for obscurity, but the code's behavior is benign.",
