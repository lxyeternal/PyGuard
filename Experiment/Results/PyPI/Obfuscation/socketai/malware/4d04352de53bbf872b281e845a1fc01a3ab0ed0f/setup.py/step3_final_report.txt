{
  "purpose": "The code defines an obfuscated function that manipulates strings and evaluates the result, then executes a shell command to download and run a remote script from a suspicious URL, potentially malicious, and includes standard packaging setup.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, the string manipulation within the obfuscated function, the subprocess.getoutput() shell command that downloads and executes an external script.",
  "sinks": "eval() on dynamically decoded strings, subprocess shell command execution that runs remote script, setting permissions to 777 on downloaded file, executing remote script via bash.",
  "flows": "The obfuscated function decodes and evaluates code, which could be malicious; the subprocess command downloads and executes a remote script, which may contain malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated string manipulation and eval(), remote script download from a suspicious URL, setting permissions to 777 before execution, dynamic code execution without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code employs obfuscation techniques to conceal its true behavior, notably through string manipulation and eval(). It downloads a script from a GitHub URL, sets permissive permissions, and executes it, which is a common malicious tactic. The presence of eval() on decoded strings further indicates malicious intent. The setup() call is standard but included in the code, possibly to mask malicious activity. The code's behavior aligns with typical malware delivery methods, such as remote code execution and obfuscation to evade detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to remote script download and execution, obfuscation, and dynamic eval usage. It should be classified as highly malicious with a malware score of 0.9, obfuscated score of 0.9, and security risk of 0.9, reflecting a severe security threat.",
