{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated function that dynamically decodes and executes code, and a setup script that downloads and runs an external script from the internet.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, the function ZTUcYyfsvCcCMQZKoDsvcwZXBVXpXgqA (decodes and evaluates code), subprocess.getoutput (executes remote script).",
  "sinks": "eval() call inside ZTUcYyfsvCcCMQZKoDsvcwZXBVXpXgqA, subprocess execution of downloaded script.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> ZTUcYyfsvCcCMQZKoDsvcwZXBVXpXgqA (via the decoded string) -> eval() (executes decoded code) -> subprocess.getoutput() -> external script downloaded and executed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated code with dynamic eval, remote script download via wget, immediate execution of external script with full permissions (chmod 777), potential backdoor or malware activity.",
  "analysis": "The script checks Python version, defines an obfuscated function that manipulates strings and executes the result, which could be malicious code. It then runs a shell command that downloads a script from a remote URL, sets it executable, and executes it immediately, which is highly suspicious. The setup() call is standard and harmless, but the prior code indicates malicious intent through obfuscation and remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated code execution and downloads and runs an external script from a remote source, which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The intent appears to be to run potentially harmful code from an external server.",
