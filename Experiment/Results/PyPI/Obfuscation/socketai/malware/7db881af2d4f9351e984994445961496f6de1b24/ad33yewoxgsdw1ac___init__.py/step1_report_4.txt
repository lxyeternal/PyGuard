{
  "purpose": "Exporting the 'collored' component, likely related to color handling or formatting.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.collored'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'init' from the local module and exposes 'collored' in the __all__ list; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in '__all__' as '__all__' is spelled correctly, but 'collored' appears to be a misspelling of 'colored'. This could indicate a typo or an intentional obfuscation. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets the __all__ variable to expose 'collored', and imports 'init' from the local module '.collored'. The spelling of 'collored' might be a typo or an intentional obfuscation. No signs of malware, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module export with a possible typo in the module or variable name. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
