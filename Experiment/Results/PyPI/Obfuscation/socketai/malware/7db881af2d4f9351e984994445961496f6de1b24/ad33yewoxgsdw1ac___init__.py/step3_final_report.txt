{
  "purpose": "Re-export or alias 'collored' from a local module, likely intended to be 'colored'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports 'init' from a local module '.collored'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external communication points are present.",
  "flows": "The import of 'init' and the export list with 'collored' are static; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in '__all__' ('collored' instead of 'colored') is the main anomaly; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, defining an export list and importing a local function. The typo in '__all__' is consistent across reports and appears to be a simple misspelling rather than obfuscation or malicious intent. No data flows, external communications, or suspicious patterns are present. The import of 'init' is unused in this snippet but not suspicious. The typo could affect module export behavior but does not introduce security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with a minor typo that may impact module exports but does not pose a security risk. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.",
