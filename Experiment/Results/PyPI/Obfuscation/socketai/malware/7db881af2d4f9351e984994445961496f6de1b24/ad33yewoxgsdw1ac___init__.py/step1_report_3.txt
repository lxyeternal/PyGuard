  "purpose": "Define and export the 'collored' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Importing 'init' from the local 'collored' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only declares exports and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in '__all__' (misspelled as '__all__'), which prevents correct module export listing. No other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to define the module exports via __all__, but misspelling prevents proper export control. It imports 'init' from the local 'collored' module but does not invoke or utilize it here. The code is minimal, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code. No external data sources, sinks, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with a minor typographical mistake in '__all__' that could affect module export behavior. There are no malicious activities or security concerns detected.",
