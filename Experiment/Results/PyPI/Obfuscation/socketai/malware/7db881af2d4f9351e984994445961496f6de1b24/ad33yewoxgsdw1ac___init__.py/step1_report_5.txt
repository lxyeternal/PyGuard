  "purpose": "Re-exporting the 'collored' module or object from the current package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'init' from the 'collored' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted data handling detected.",
  "flows": "Importing 'init' from '.collored' without further data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in '__all__' list ('collored' instead of 'colored') may indicate a typo but not malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets the __all__ attribute to include 'collored', likely intended to expose this symbol when the package is imported. It then imports 'init' from the same module. The code is minimal, with no data processing, external communications, or suspicious constructs. The typo in '__all__' could be an oversight but does not indicate malicious intent. No signs of malware or malicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module re-export with a typographical error in the __all__ list. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
