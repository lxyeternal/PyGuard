  "malware_score": 0.9,
  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, designed to silently download and execute external payloads without validation. Its obfuscation tactics and asynchronous execution further support malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on behavior. It should be considered a high-severity security threat and treated as malware."
