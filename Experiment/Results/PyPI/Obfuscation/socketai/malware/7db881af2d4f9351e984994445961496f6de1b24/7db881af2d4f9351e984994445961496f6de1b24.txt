      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with heavy obfuscation in the path manipulation, which raises suspicion. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as network access or data theft. The obfuscation could be benign or malicious; further dynamic analysis is recommended. The scores assigned are consistent with the observed obfuscation and lack of active malicious payloads."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, designed to silently download and execute external payloads without validation. Its obfuscation tactics and asynchronous execution further support malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on behavior. It should be considered a high-severity security threat and treated as malware."
