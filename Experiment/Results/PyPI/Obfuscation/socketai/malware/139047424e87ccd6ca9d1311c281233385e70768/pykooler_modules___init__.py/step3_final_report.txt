  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), environment variables, network communication, file access.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system, environment variables, data output, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user input, environment variables) potentially flow into dynamic execution or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), complex control flow, lack of code in some reports, inconsistent code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are mostly benign with straightforward logic, no suspicious patterns, and no obfuscation. Reports 1, 2, 3, and 4 show no code or simple, clear code with high confidence of safety. Report 5 contains obfuscated code with signs of dynamic execution and complex control flow, raising suspicion. The obfuscation score (0.7) and malware score (0.3) in report 5 are justified given the signs of concealment but lack of confirmed malicious payloads. The security risk score (0.5) reflects moderate concern due to obfuscation and dynamic features. The confidence score (0.6) indicates moderate certainty. Overall, the scores are consistent with the analysis, with report 5 warranting cautious attention but not definitive malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with appropriate low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5 shows signs of obfuscation and potential concealment, justifying moderate suspicion but no confirmed malware. The scoring aligns with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary at this stage.",
