  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform some functionality within a Python package, but the specific intent is unclear without analyzing the actual code content.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external files, if present; specific sources cannot be identified without code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, system commands, or data transmissions, but details are not available without code content.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be determined without specific code, but any such flow should be scrutinized for malicious data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without examining the actual code content. Look for hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code content provided for detailed analysis. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are apparent without the actual code. Need the code to evaluate further.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to determine malicious behavior or security risks definitively due to lack of code content. Further review with the actual code is necessary.",
