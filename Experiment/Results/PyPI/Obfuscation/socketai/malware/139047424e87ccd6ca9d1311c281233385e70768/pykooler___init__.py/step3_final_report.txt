  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and descriptions.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, user inputs, system/network calls, and data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, system commands, file operations, data leaks, or external communications.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs flow into system/network calls or data processing functions, with no evidence of malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; limited code visibility restricts certainty.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code snippets, relying solely on descriptions. Malware and obfuscation scores are consistently zero, justified by the absence of evidence. Risk scores are low (0.2–0.3), reflecting cautious assessment due to limited visibility but no indicators of malicious intent. Confidence levels are moderate to high, aligning with the descriptions provided. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified across reports. The evaluations are internally consistent and appropriately cautious.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, there is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified given the limited code context. All reports correctly assign zero to malware and obfuscation scores, with conservative risk assessments. No further adjustments are necessary.",
