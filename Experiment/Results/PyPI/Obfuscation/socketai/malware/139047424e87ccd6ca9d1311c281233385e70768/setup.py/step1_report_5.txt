{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package with a custom install command that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated code within the variable wopvEaTEcopFEavc, which is decoded and executed during the run method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The eval(compile(...)) call that executes the decoded and deobfuscated code, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "The obfuscated string is decoded through XOR operations with a large numeric string, then compiled and executed via eval, representing a direct source-to-sink flow of malicious payload.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a large obfuscated string, use of eval and compile functions to execute code at install time, and the absence of any apparent legitimate purpose for such obfuscation. The variable names are nonsensical, indicating intentional concealment.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines a custom install command class that overrides the run method. Within run, it contains a large obfuscated string assigned to wopvEaTEcopFEavc, and a numeric string in iOpvEoeaaeavocp. The code decodes the obfuscated string via XOR with the numeric string, then executes the result using eval(compile()). This pattern is typical of malicious code that hides payloads within obfuscated strings and executes them during installation, which is suspicious behavior. The rest of the setup code is standard, with no other suspicious activity or inputs/outputs identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated payload that is decoded and executed during package installation, indicating malicious intent. This pattern suggests an embedded backdoor or malicious code that runs automatically, which is highly suspicious. The overall security risk is high due to the obfuscated execution of arbitrary code during install, and the malware score is also high.",
