  "purpose": "Custom installation script that executes obfuscated code during package installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated string assigned to 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' which is then decoded and evaluated, and the string of digits 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp' used as a key for decoding.",
  "sinks": "The 'eval' of dynamically decoded code from the obfuscated string, which can execute arbitrary code, potentially malicious.",
  "flows": "The obfuscated string is decoded by XOR with a repeated digit string, then compiled and evaluated, executing arbitrary code during install.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated code, the use of 'eval' with dynamically constructed code, and no clear purpose for executing such code. The string appears encrypted or encoded to hide its true intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom 'InstallCommand' that overrides the 'run' method. Inside 'run', a large obfuscated string is XOR-decoded with a repeating sequence of digits, resulting in code that is then compiled and executed with 'eval'. The purpose of this code is unclear, but such patterns are common in malicious code trying to hide malicious payloads. The use of 'eval' on decoded code during installation is highly suspicious, indicating potential malicious intent or sabotage. The rest of the setup script is standard, with no other suspicious dependencies or operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a heavily obfuscated payload that is decoded and executed during installation, which is a significant security risk. This behavior strongly suggests malicious intent, such as executing hidden malicious code at install time. The package should be considered unsafe until the payload is further analyzed and verified.",
