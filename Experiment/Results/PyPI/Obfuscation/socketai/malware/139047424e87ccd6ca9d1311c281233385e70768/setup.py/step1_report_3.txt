{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package and includes a custom install command that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' and the associated data 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp' are sources from which data is read. The code also reads the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "The eval(compile()) call executes dynamically decoded code from the obfuscated string, which can be a malicious sink if the code is harmful.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the obfuscated string through XOR decryption with the numeric string, then to eval after compilation, executing potentially malicious code during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated code block that performs XOR decryption followed by eval/compile. The string appears intentionally obscured, which is suspicious. No other input sources are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities and defines a custom install command class. Within the run method, it contains an obfuscated string that appears to be encrypted or encoded. It uses a numeric string as a key to XOR-decrypt the obfuscated string, resulting in executable Python code. This code is then compiled and evaluated, meaning code can be executed dynamically during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide malicious code. The rest of the setup script appears standard, but the core concern is the obfuscated code execution, which indicates malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a hidden, XOR-encoded payload that executes during installation, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior. This suggests the package is designed to perform concealed malicious actions at install time.",
