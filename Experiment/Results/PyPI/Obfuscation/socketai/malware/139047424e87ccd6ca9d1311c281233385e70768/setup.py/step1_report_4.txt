{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package with a custom install command that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated string assigned to 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' and the associated code in the 'run' method of 'InstallCommand'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'eval(compile(...))' which runs dynamically decoded code, potentially untrusted or malicious.",
  "flows": "The obfuscated string is decoded through XOR with a key derived from a large number string, then executed via eval(compile()).",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated code that decodes and executes a string at runtime. The obfuscated string is long, nonsensical, and appears deliberately concealed. No other external inputs are used; the decoding relies solely on hardcoded data.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom installation class 'InstallCommand' that overrides 'run'. Inside 'run', it attempts to decode an obfuscated string using XOR with a repetitive key derived from a large number string. After decoding, it executes the code via eval(compile()), which is highly suspicious. The decoding process does not involve any external input and appears designed to conceal malicious code. The overall structure indicates an intentional hidden backdoor or malicious payload embedded within the package, triggered during installation. The rest of the setup code is standard and harmless, but the obfuscated code's behavior is highly suspicious due to its decoding and execution pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically decoded code that executes during installation, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent or backdoor. This pattern is commonly used to conceal malicious payloads. Therefore, this package should be considered unsafe for installation.",
