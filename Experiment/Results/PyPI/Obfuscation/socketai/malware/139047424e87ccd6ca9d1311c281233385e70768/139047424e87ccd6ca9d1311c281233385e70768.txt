      "conclusion": "The package includes a heavily obfuscated, malicious payload that executes arbitrary code during installation, representing a severe security threat. The pattern of decoding and executing code at install time is a classic indicator of malicious activity, warranting immediate caution and removal from distribution until further analysis is performed."

      "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with appropriate low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5 shows signs of obfuscation and potential concealment, justifying moderate suspicion but no confirmed malware. The scoring aligns with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary at this stage."
