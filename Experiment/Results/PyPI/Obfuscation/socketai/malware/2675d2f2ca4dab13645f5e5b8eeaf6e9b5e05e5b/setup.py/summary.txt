  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a static setup script with obfuscated naming, but no evidence of malicious activity or payloads. The high obfuscation scores reflect suspicion but do not indicate active threats. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score remains at 0. Continuous monitoring is recommended if further suspicious patterns emerge."
