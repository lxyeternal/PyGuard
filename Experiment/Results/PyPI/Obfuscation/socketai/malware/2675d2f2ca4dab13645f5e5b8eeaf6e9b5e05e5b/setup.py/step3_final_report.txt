  "anomalies": "Nonsensical package name 'm6nbq5t9qsrruvfu', unusual parameter 'wMYfhgpUSPouVBminKoPMKgpmAcwJFyA' not recognized by setup(). Variable and parameter names obfuscated or meaningless.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static setup script with obfuscated naming. No dynamic code, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The suspicious elements are the nonsensical package name and an unrecognized parameter, which may be attempts at obfuscation or concealment. All reports correctly identify the absence of active malicious behavior, assigning malware scores of 0. The obfuscation scores are high (~0.6-0.7), justified by the unusual naming. The overall security risk remains low (~0.2), as no malicious activity is detected. The code's benign nature suggests these obfuscated elements are likely red flags rather than evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a static setup script with obfuscated naming, but no evidence of malicious activity or payloads. The high obfuscation scores reflect suspicion but do not indicate active threats. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score remains at 0. Continuous monitoring is recommended if further suspicious patterns emerge.",
