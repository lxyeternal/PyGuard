  "security_risk": 0.9,

  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, employing obfuscation, marshaled payloads, and dynamic execution to conceal its true intent. Embedded URLs further suggest malicious activity such as remote command execution or data theft. The high scores across reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
