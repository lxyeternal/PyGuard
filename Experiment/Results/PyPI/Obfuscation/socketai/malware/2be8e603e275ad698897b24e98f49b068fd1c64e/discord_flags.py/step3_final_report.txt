{
  "purpose": "The code defines a comprehensive set of classes representing bitwise flags for Discord entities such as messages, users, intents, channels, and application features. These classes facilitate internal management of feature toggles and permissions via static attributes, decorators, and class methods.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, decorator functions, class initializers, and property methods that set or query flag bits.",
  "sinks": "Internal flag operations; no external data sinks, network activity, or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of flag objects → setting or querying flags via properties and methods → internal bitwise operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The code follows standard patterns for flag management.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured implementation of flag classes for Discord API features, using decorators to define valid flags and class methods for flag operations. No external data handling, network activity, or secrets are present. The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is intended solely for internal feature toggling and permission management, with well-documented properties and methods. The absence of external interactions or hidden code indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of feature and permission flags for a Discord library. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be set as malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: approximately 0.1, reflecting its safe, internal use nature.",
