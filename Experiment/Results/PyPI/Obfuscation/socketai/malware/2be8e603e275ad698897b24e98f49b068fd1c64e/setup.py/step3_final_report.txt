  "purpose": "A minimal setup script defining package metadata and dependencies for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Static code defining package name, version, and dependencies; no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or code execution points.",
  "flows": "N/A — static configuration without data flow or dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual, non-descriptive package name 'wnqyyc378vxxqose'; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with a suspiciously random package name but no dynamic or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the absence of malware, with the only notable aspect being the package name. The obfuscation scores in some reports are overestimated; given the code's simplicity, obfuscation is unlikely. The malware score remains zero across all reports, and the security risk is low (~0.1), justified by the unusual name but no actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The package is benign, with no malicious code or obfuscation. The only concern is the non-descriptive package name, which does not constitute malicious intent. The scores in the reports are generally appropriate, though the obfuscation score in report 4 should be lowered from 0.7 to around 0.1 to better reflect the code's transparency.",
