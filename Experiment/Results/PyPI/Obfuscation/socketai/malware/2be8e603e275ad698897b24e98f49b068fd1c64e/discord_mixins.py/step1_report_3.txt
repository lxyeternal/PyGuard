{
  "purpose": "Defines two classes, EqualityComparable and Hashable, for object comparison and hashing based on an 'id' attribute.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; class definitions rely solely on internal data (self.id).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; no I/O operations or data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Class methods operate on internal object attributes without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and standard for Python class design. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a simple base class for equality comparison based on 'id' and a subclass that computes a hash by right-shifting the 'id'. It includes no external data handling, no input/output, and no security-sensitive operations. The license block is a standard MIT license, unrelated to functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The classes are minimal and typical for object management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of comparison and hashing classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger library or project, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
