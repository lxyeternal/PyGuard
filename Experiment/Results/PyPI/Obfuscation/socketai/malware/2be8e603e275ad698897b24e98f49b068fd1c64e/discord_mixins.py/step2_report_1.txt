  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines two classes, `EqualityComparable` and `Hashable`.\n   - Both classes rely solely on an `id` attribute.\n   - `EqualityComparable` implements `__eq__` to compare `id`s.\n   - `Hashable` inherits from `EqualityComparable` and implements `__hash__` by right-shifting `id` by 22 bits.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no external input, no I/O, no network calls, and no suspicious constructs.\n   - The license is a standard MIT license, typical for open-source projects.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks**:\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, nor does it perform any network or file operations.\n   - There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The hashing function is simple and predictable.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage.\n\n3. **Malware and Obfuscation Scores**:\n   - The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation.\n   - No malicious intent is evident.\n   - Malware score should be 0.\n   - Obfuscated score should be 0.\n\n4. **Risk Score Justification**:\n   - Since the code is benign, implements basic utility classes, and does not introduce security vulnerabilities, the overall security risk should be very low.\n   - The existing reports assign a risk score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n5. **Score Consistency and Potential Adjustments**:\n   - The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the code’s content.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Evaluation**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (code is straightforward, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of equality and hashing classes with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0",
