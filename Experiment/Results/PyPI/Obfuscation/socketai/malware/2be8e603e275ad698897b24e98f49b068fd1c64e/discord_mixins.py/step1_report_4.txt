{
  "purpose": "Define classes for equality comparison and hashing based on an 'id' attribute.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it defines class behaviors and attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or security issues are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to vulnerable sinks; methods operate on class attributes only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two classes: EqualityComparable and Hashable. EqualityComparable provides an __eq__ method that compares 'id' attributes if the other object is of the same class. Hashable inherits from EqualityComparable and defines __hash__ as a right-shift of the 'id'. All operations are straightforward attribute comparisons and bitwise shifts. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no network operations. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard comparison and hashing mechanisms without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and purposeful for defining object equality and hashability.",
