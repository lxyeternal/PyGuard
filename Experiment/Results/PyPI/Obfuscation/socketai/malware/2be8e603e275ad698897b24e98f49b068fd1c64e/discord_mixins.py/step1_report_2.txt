{
  "purpose": "Define classes for equality comparison and hashing based on an 'id' attribute.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it operates solely on class attributes and methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; class methods operate on internal attributes.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior are evident. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, EqualityComparable and Hashable, that rely on an 'id' attribute for comparison and hashing. No external inputs, network calls, or environment variables are used. The hash function performs a bitwise right shift on 'id'. All operations are simple and predictable. No malicious or maliciously intended code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of comparison and hashing classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and intended for use as a utility in larger projects.",
