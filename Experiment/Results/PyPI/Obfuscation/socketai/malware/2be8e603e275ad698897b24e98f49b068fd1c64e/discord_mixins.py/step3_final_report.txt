{
  "purpose": "Defines utility classes for object comparison and hashing based on an 'id' attribute.",
  "sources": "Class attribute 'id' used in __eq__ and __hash__ methods.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, output, or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Comparison and hash functions operate solely on the 'id' attribute within class instances.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes, 'EqualityComparable' and 'Hashable', relying on a numeric 'id'. The __eq__ method compares 'id's for equality, and __hash__ returns a bit-shifted version of 'id'. There are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code is simple, well-structured, and uses standard Python features. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or security vulnerabilities are present. The hashing method is predictable but typical for such utility classes. Overall, the code poses no security risks and is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of comparison and hashing classes with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
