{
  "purpose": "Defines a Reaction class representing a reaction to a message, including methods to remove, clear, and list users who reacted.",
  "sources": "Reads data from message._state.get_reaction_emoji, data['emoji'], data.get('count'), data['me'], message, and parameters passed to methods.",
  "sinks": "Uses message.remove_reaction and message.clear_reaction methods, and the HTTP client to get reaction users.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and message state into methods like remove, clear, and users; user data is retrieved via API calls and yielded as User or Member objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of API calls appears standard, and no obfuscated or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard message reaction management functionalities with methods to remove reactions, clear reactions, and retrieve users who reacted. It uses data passed during initialization and API calls for reaction users. No obfuscated language features, dynamic code execution, or suspicious data handling are observed. The interaction with the HTTP API is typical for such functionality, and no hardcoded credentials or malicious data flows are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of reaction handling in a messaging application, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It relies on typical API calls and data structures without any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
