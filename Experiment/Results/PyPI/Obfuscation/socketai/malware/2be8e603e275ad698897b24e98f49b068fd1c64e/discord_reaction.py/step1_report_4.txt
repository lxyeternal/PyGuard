{
  "purpose": "Define a class representing a reaction to a message, including methods for managing reactions and retrieving users who reacted.",
  "sources": "Data from ReactionPayload parameter during class instantiation; message object attributes; HTTP API calls in users() method.",
  "sinks": "HTTP API calls in users() method (get_reaction_users) which retrieve user data; message.remove_reaction and message.clear_reaction methods.",
  "flows": "Reaction data (emoji, count, me) from payload to class attributes; user data retrieved via API in users() method; removal and clearing of reactions through message methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious variable names. Use of standard library and typical API calls. No external or suspicious domain connections.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Reaction class with typical attributes and methods to manage message reactions in a chat application, likely Discord. It retrieves reaction user data via API calls, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The methods for removing and clearing reactions invoke message API methods securely. The users() method paginates through reaction users safely, with no suspicious behavior or data leaks. Overall, the code appears to be a standard implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of message reaction management in a chat client API, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It securely manages reaction data and user retrieval without any anomalous or suspicious actions.",
