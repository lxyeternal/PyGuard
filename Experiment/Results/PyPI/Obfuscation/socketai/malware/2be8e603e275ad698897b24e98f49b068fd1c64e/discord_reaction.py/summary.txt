  "conclusion": "This Reaction class is a legitimate, standard component for managing message reactions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the external API interactions, which are typical and not inherently dangerous."
