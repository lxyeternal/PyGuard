  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The report correctly identifies that the code implements WebSocket clients for Discord, handling connection, events, heartbeat, and voice. The data flows are standard for such clients.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, backdoors, obfuscation, or secret data exfiltration detected. The code uses standard libraries and patterns.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that this is a legitimate Discord WebSocket implementation with no malware or malicious behavior is accurate.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to report 1, correctly describes standard Discord gateway and voice WebSocket client functions.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The handling of `secret_key` is part of voice encryption, not malicious.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears legitimate, with no malicious signals.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly notes that the code manages WebSocket for Discord, including voice.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code. The `secret_key` is part of voice encryption, standard protocol.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a standard Discord client implementation, no signs of malware.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the code's handling of WebSocket communication, heartbeat, and events.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors. The code uses standard patterns, and debug logs are conditional.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears legitimate and standard.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly describes the code's functions.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious payloads, no data exfiltration, no backdoors. The handling of WebSocket messages and reconnections is standard.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a typical WebSocket client for Discord, with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malware present. The scores of 0 are justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the code's clarity.\n\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1 or 0.2) due to the nature of WebSocket handling, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n### **My Final Estimation:**\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of Discord WebSocket clients, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n\n**Therefore, I suggest:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2, consistent with the reports.\n\n**Additional note:** No further escalation is warranted; the code appears safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
