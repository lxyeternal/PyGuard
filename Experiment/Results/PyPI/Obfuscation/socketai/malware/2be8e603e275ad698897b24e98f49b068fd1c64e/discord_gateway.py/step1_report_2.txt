{
  "purpose": "The code implements WebSocket clients for Discord's gateway and voice connections, managing real-time communication with Discord servers.",
  "sources": "Inputs come from network messages received via aiohttp WebSocket connections; user-controlled parameters such as session IDs, tokens, and optional callback hooks.",
  "sinks": "Sending JSON-formatted data over WebSocket connections, including identification, heartbeat, status updates, and voice protocol messages.",
  "flows": "Network data received (sources) are processed and may trigger functions, send responses, or update internal state; data is also sent via send_as_json functions based on events or commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code snippets. Use of threading and asyncio appears standard. No encrypted or obfuscated code present. No hidden network connections or data leaks detected. The code handles standard Discord gateway protocol functions.",
  "analysis": "The code structures WebSocket communication with Discord, managing events, heartbeats, session resumes, and voice data exchanges. No signs of malicious intent, such as unauthorized data collection, backdoors, or covert network activity. It uses standard Python libraries and established patterns for network communication. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present. Hooks and event listeners are designed for extensibility, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of Discord's WebSocket and voice WebSocket clients, with no indicators of malicious or sabotage behavior. It performs standard protocol handling for Discord integrations, with proper state management and network operations. No malicious signals detected.",
