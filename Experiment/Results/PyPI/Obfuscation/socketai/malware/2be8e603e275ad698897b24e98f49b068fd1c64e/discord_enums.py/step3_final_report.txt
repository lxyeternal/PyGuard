{
  "purpose": "Defines various enum classes for Discord constants and utility functions for safe enum handling, including mechanisms for managing unknown or invalid values.",
  "sources": "Static enum class definitions; no external data input or untrusted sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing; internal lookups only.",
  "flows": "Internal enum value lookups via functions like try_enum; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Use of create_unknown_value and try_enum is standard for handling untrusted data safely.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of enum class definitions with a custom metaclass ensuring immutability and type safety. Utility functions handle unknown enum values gracefully, preventing errors with unrecognized inputs. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or external data handling. The pattern of creating placeholder 'unknown' enum instances is common and safe, not malicious. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The code is purely definitional, serving as constants and helpers for a Discord API wrapper or similar library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and contains no malicious or security-threatening elements. The handling of unknown values is a standard, safe pattern. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware likelihood is zero.",
