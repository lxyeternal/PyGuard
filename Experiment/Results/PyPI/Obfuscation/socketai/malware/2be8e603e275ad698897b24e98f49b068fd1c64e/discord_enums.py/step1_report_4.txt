{
  "purpose": "Defines various Enum classes and utility functions for a Discord-related library, facilitating structured representation of constants and types.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, type annotations, and internal definitions. No external input sources or data reading mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data, user input, or external outputs. The code primarily declares data structures and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code constructs Enums and helper functions without processing external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of Enum classes with utility methods.",
  "analysis": "The code implements custom metaclasses and Enum classes to manage various constant values for a Discord library. It uses standard design patterns for immutable Enums and provides utility functions for handling unknown or invalid values. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or external communications are present. There are no hardcoded credentials, network activities, or security-sensitive operations. The use of 'try_enum' function to handle unknown values is standard and safe. Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and secure, serving purely as data definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of constant definitions and utility functions for a Discord SDK. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
