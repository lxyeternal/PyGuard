{
  "purpose": "Define various Enum classes for use in a Discord-related library, providing type-safe representations of constants and categories.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources are used. The code solely defines classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or user input are present. The code creates immutable classes and utility functions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely definitional and does not process external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard enum and class definitions with custom metaclasses. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are observed. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines multiple Enum classes with associated methods and properties, mainly for representing Discord constants such as channel types, message types, user flags, and more. It uses a custom EnumMeta metaclass to create immutable, type-safe enum classes. Functions like create_unknown_value and try_enum provide mechanisms to handle unknown or invalid enum values gracefully, aiding robustness. No external input handling, network operations, or suspicious logic is present. The code is well-structured, clean, and adheres to standard patterns for enum management. Overall, this appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious utility module for a Discord API wrapper or similar application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of enum definitions and related utility functions for a Discord library. It does not contain any malicious or sabotage behaviors. No security risks or malware signals are detected. The code is safe and purely for defining constants.",
