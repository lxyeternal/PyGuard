  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines enums for Discord constants; no external or untrusted data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or data flows involving untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious or suspicious behavior; standard enum definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a benign utility module for defining constants, with no malware or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard enum patterns, safe handling, and no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Highlights the use of `try_enum` and `create_unknown_value` for handling untrusted or invalid data.\n- **Potential concern:** These functions could be invoked with untrusted data, but they are designed for safe handling, creating placeholder 'unknown' enum values.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; the pattern is common for robust enum handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Focuses on the code being purely data definitions, with no external data handling or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar conclusion: standard enum definitions, no external data processing, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is a set of enum definitions, utility functions for safe enum handling, and no dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data processing.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, since the code is purely definitional with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The functions `try_enum` and `create_unknown_value` could be used with untrusted data, but they are designed to handle such cases safely by creating placeholder enum instances. This pattern is common and not malicious.\n- No signs of backdoors, secrets, or malicious logic are present.\n- The custom enum metaclass and utility functions improve robustness but do not introduce security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe, and well-structured set of enum definitions for a Discord library, with no malicious or security risk signals.",
