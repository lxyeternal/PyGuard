  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code is standard license and type hint setup.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified.  \n- **Scores?** All zero, which is appropriate.  \n- **Justification for scores?** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- **Overall:** Benign, standard code.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code is typical for setting up type hints with conditional imports.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores?** All zero, consistent with benign code.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or security concerns.  \n- **Overall:** Standard, safe code.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Same pattern of license and type hint setup.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores?** All zero.  \n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Overall:** Safe, typical code.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Again, standard license and type hinting code.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores?** All zero.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected.  \n- **Overall:** Benign.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a typical setup for type annotations with license info.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores?** All zero.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious or security concerns.  \n- **Overall:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports are 0, which aligns with the code being benign.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are 0, no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk Score:** All reports are 0, indicating no security risk.\n\n**My own assessment:**  \nGiven the code's straightforward nature, license header, and standard type hinting patterns, I concur with the reports' conclusions. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, standard boilerplate for open-source Python projects, and poses no security threat.",
