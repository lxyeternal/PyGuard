  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard Python module with a license header, importing __future__ annotations, and setting up a type variable with conditional import based on `TYPE_CHECKING`.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The code is typical for type hinting support in Python projects, especially when supporting static analysis and type checking.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign a security risk of 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning errors:\n- No issues are identified; all reasoning is sound.\n- The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), justified given the code's simplicity and standard pattern.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since there's no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk, increasing scores would be unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's purpose and structure.",
