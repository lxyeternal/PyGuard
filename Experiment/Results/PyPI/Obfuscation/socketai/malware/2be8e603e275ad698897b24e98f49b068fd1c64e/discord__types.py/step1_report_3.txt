{
  "purpose": "Define type variables and imports for type checking in a Python package, primarily to support type hints and static analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module docstring, license header, import statements, and conditional type variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external data output is involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is primarily static type hint setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a conditional import pattern for type checking which is standard; no anomalies or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code starts with a license header, which is normal. It imports future annotations for compatibility. The 'if TYPE_CHECKING' block conditionally imports type variables and modules for static analysis purposes. The else block defines a type variable with a bound to 'Client'. The pattern is typical for type hinting in Python projects, especially for optional static typing support. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or data leaks. The code does not execute any runtime behavior other than type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup for type annotations in a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
