{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up type annotations and licensing information for a Python project, likely related to a client library.",
  "sources": "The only data input is the type checking conditional, which does not handle untrusted data; the license header is static text.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only defines type variables and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures are present. The use of conditional type annotations and licensing info is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a license header, standard import statements, and a conditional block that defines a type variable for type checking purposes. It uses '__future__' imports and 'typing' features correctly. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling that could indicate malicious activity. The code structure is typical for a library's type annotations and licensing info, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup for licensing and type annotations with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
