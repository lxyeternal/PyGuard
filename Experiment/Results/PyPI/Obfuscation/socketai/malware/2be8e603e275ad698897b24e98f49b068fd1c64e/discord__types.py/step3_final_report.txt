  "purpose": "Setup for type hinting and licensing in a Python module.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, typing, and conditional import of Client class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Conditional import flow based on TYPE_CHECKING; no runtime data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for static type support.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module with a license header, imports __future__.annotations for forward references, and conditionally defines a TypeVar 'ClientT' depending on TYPE_CHECKING. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The pattern is common for static type hinting support in Python projects. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are detected. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup for licensing and type hinting in a Python package. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
