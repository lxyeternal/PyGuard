  "purpose": "Define type variables for type hinting with conditional import support.",
  "sources": "Reads the __future__ import, the TYPE_CHECKING constant, and the local module imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code sets up type variable 'ClientT' with different definitions depending on TYPE_CHECKING; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses conditional type variable definition, which is normal for type hinting and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module that sets up type hints with conditional imports for type checking. It uses 'TYPE_CHECKING' to avoid runtime imports, which is a common pattern. No malicious code, external communication, or security risks are evident. The license is MIT, which is permissive and standard. The code is straightforward and focused on type hints.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign type hinting setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
