{
  "purpose": "The code sets up type annotations and imports for a Python package, with licensing information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the license text at the top and imports from __future__ and typing modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The only flow involves importing future features and type variables, with no data transfer from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present; standard licensing and type hint setup.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with an open-source license, which is standard and indicates no malicious intent. It then imports __future__ annotations for forward reference support and typing modules for type annotations. The conditional block checks if TYPE_CHECKING is true, and if so, imports additional types for static analysis, defining a type variable ClientT with constraints. The else branch assigns a similar type variable, ensuring type annotations work at runtime. All operations are typical for a Python package setup and contain no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. No data is read from or written to external sources, and no malicious code or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for type annotations and licensing with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks.",
