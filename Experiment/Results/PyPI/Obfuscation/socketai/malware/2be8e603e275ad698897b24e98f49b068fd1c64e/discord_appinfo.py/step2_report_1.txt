  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The report confirms the code is a standard data model with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are both 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The report correctly identifies no security issues.\n- **Overall:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The analysis states the code is straightforward data handling.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, obfuscated is 0, which aligns with the assessment.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Overall:** Sound evaluation.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The report notes the code is a typical data model with no malicious patterns.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, obfuscated is 0, consistent with findings.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior, no external network activity, no backdoors.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is again a standard data model.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious code or obfuscation, safe data handling.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The detailed analysis confirms the code is benign.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, consistent.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, straightforward data encapsulation.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and given the code's nature, this is correct.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0 or very close to it, reflecting no security risk.\n\n**However,** the reports note that the code is purely data modeling, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The only minor point is the \"securityRisk\" score in report 3 being 0.1, which seems slightly high given the absence of any vulnerabilities or risky patterns.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — No security risk evident; the code is standard SDK data classes.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis. The code is a typical data model with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThis code snippet is safe, straightforward, and does not contain any malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate.",
