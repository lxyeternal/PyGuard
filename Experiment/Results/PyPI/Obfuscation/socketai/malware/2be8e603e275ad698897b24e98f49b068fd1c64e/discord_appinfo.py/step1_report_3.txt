{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for managing application information in a Discord bot framework, including AppInfo, PartialAppInfo, and AppInstallParams.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are primarily from external payloads (e.g., AppInfoPayload, PartialAppInfoPayload, InstallParamsPayload) received from Discord's API.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data is used in system commands, network calls, or file operations within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external payloads into class attributes; no untrusted data flows into system-critical functions or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code uses standard class structures and property methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models with attributes initialized from API payloads, with no input validation beyond standard attribute setting. No malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The only external interaction is via data passed to constructors, which are presumably sanitized by Discord API. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data model implementation for Discord application info, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and adheres to standard practices.",
