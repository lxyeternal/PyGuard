{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes related to application information within a Discord API library, including handling app info, partial info, and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input payloads during object initialization, such as 'data' dictionaries passed to constructors.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks like network connections or file writes are present; data is used internally for object attributes and asset retrieval.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input payloads into class attributes; properties like 'icon' and 'cover_image' generate assets based on internal data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URLs, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is standard for a data model class with attribute initialization and property methods.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of data model classes for managing application info in a Discord API context. It uses payload data to set attributes, with properties for retrieving assets. There are no network operations, no evaluation of untrusted input beyond attribute assignment, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The code includes type hints, documentation, and optional attributes, consistent with standard SDK design. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or backdoors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK data model implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It solely handles data parsing and object representation for application information.",
