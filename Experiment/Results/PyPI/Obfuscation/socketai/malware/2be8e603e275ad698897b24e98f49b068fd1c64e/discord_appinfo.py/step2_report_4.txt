  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is a standard data model with no malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. It correctly identifies that data flows are internal and that no external sinks or network operations are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5.  \n  Given the thorough analysis, the risk score seems appropriate, though perhaps slightly high if considering only data models. But since it’s a standard SDK class, a risk score of 0.5 might be marginally high; perhaps 0.2–0.3 would be more precise.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, no external network or file operations, and no obfuscation. The code is safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with a focus on data encapsulation and no suspicious activity. The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), but overall the analysis is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1–0.2.  \n  The risk score of 0.1 is reasonable; the code is straightforward.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is identified as a data model with no malicious activity, network calls, or obfuscation. The confidence is high (1), and the analysis aligns with previous reports.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n  The risk score is appropriate, considering no security issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The analysis emphasizes safe data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n  The score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: no malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard data encapsulation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0–0.1.  \n  The risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** The majority of reports assign a very low risk score (0.1), which aligns with the nature of the code as a data model without external or risky operations.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Reasoning:** The code is a standard, well-structured data model for a Discord SDK. It reads data from payloads, creates assets, and exposes properties for use elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are appropriate given the nature of the code. No changes are necessary.",
