  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The code defines classes for app info, partial info, and install parameters, reading data from payloads. No external sinks or network operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URLs, or obfuscation. Standard data model pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The report's scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, with data from API responses. No external sinks or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard data model.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9 (the report's risk score). The high risk score seems slightly conservative but acceptable given the nature of the code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Defines classes for app info, partial info, and install parameters, with data from payloads. No external network or command execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the 'securityRisk' being 0.1, possibly due to the reliance on external data.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. These are reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar data models, asset retrieval via URL strings, no external sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Data from payloads, with asset property methods converting identifiers into Asset objects. No external network or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard data model.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The report's risk score is 0, which is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is correct. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly very low (0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the code's nature as data models without external or executable behavior.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's functionality.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to reliance on external data, but no actual security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured data model for Discord application info, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code, and very low security risk.",
