{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes representing application information for a Discord bot, including metadata, assets, and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Data sources include JSON payloads from Discord API responses for app info and partial app info, accessed via the constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data flows mainly within object attributes; no external sinks such as network communication, file writing, or execution occur.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API payloads into class attributes, with some properties converting data into asset objects; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic, are present. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to typical data modeling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines data classes with attributes populated from API responses, and includes property methods for asset retrieval. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network operations, code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The class design appears focused on data encapsulation and representation, with no risky or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard data model for Discord application info, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It processes and represents API data safely without any malicious behavior.",
