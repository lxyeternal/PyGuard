  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code in reports 1 and 2 demonstrates obfuscation and behaviors consistent with malicious activity, warranting caution. Report 3 shows some suspicious features but lacks definitive malicious payloads, so suspicion is moderate. Reports 4 and 5 are benign or lack sufficient data. The scores are generally justified; minor adjustments to malware suspicion levels could improve accuracy. Overall, the dependency exhibits potential security risks primarily in reports 1 and 2."
