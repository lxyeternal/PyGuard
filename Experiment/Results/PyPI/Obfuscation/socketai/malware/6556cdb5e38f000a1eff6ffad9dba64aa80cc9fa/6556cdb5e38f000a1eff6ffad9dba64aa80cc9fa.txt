      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and exhibits typical malware behaviors, including heavy obfuscation, system modifications, privilege escalation, and potential persistence mechanisms. It should be classified as malicious with high confidence, and the package should be flagged for review, quarantine, or removal."

      "conclusion": "The code in reports 1 and 2 demonstrates obfuscation and behaviors consistent with malicious activity, warranting caution. Report 3 shows some suspicious features but lacks definitive malicious payloads, so suspicion is moderate. Reports 4 and 5 are benign or lack sufficient data. The scores are generally justified; minor adjustments to malware suspicion levels could improve accuracy. Overall, the dependency exhibits potential security risks primarily in reports 1 and 2."
