  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval(), dynamic imports, environment variables, network activity, input/output functions.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writing, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval() or input() leading to network transmission or file modification.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in most reports, with no obfuscation or malicious indicators. Report 2 shows significant obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network activity, justifying higher suspicion scores. Other reports are straightforward, with no suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports align with these observations, with Report 2's malware score of 0.6 and obfuscation score of 0.8 reflecting its suspicious features. The overall security risk scores are consistent with the presence or absence of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports describe benign code, with Report 2 showing signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution that justify higher malware and risk scores. The scoring system accurately reflects the analyzed behaviors, and no adjustments are necessary.",
