  "purpose": "Detects and executes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup if 'tahg' directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "Reads the existence of 'tahg' directory; executes subprocess with encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of obfuscated PowerShell command in a hidden window; potential data exfiltration or remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Checks directory -> if absent, runs encoded PowerShell command via subprocess -> command executes silently.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad try-except blocks hiding errors; execution of encoded, obfuscated PowerShell command during setup; silent failure handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a directory check, then executes a Base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window flags if the directory is missing. The command is obfuscated, and the execution is silent, which are common indicators of malicious intent. The broad exception handling conceals errors, further masking potential malicious activity. The setup call appears standard but is wrapped in try-except, which could hide issues. The encoded command's content is unknown, but the techniques used are typical of malicious payload delivery or backdoors. The high obfuscation and stealth execution strongly suggest malicious or suspicious behavior, warranting high scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to executing an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup, with broad error suppression. While the actual payload remains unknown, the techniques used are characteristic of malicious activity, justifying high suspicion and risk scores.",
