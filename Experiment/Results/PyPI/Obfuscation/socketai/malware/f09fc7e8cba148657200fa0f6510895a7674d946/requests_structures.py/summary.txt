  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated, which raises suspicion, but there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The low malware score (0.1) and high obfuscation score (0.7) are appropriate. The moderate security risk score (0.2-0.3) reflects caution due to obfuscation but no active threats. Continuous monitoring and broader context review are recommended."
