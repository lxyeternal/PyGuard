  "purpose": "A complex HTTP request/response handling library with URL parsing, request preparation, response processing, and cookie management.",
  "sources": "URL parsing functions, request data preparation, headers, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through headers, URL manipulation, and request bodies; exception handling paths.",
  "flows": "Input URL and request parameters flow through URL validation, request setup, and response processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation via variable and method names, complex control flow, dynamic attribute setting, suspicious import aliasing, extensive exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation with non-descriptive variable names and layered exception handling, which could be attempts to conceal malicious activity. No direct evidence of network connections, data exfiltration, or hardcoded secrets is observed. The URL parsing and request setup functions perform complex validation and encoding, but these are typical in HTTP libraries. The obfuscation level and import aliasing raise suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent. The code's structure suggests it could be legitimate but intentionally obscured, warranting caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a highly obfuscated HTTP request/response utility with no explicit malicious activity but significant complexity and obfuscation that could be used to conceal malicious behavior. The overall security risk is moderate, with a malware score of 0.3, obfuscation score of 0.75, and risk score of 0.45, indicating caution but not definitive maliciousness.",
