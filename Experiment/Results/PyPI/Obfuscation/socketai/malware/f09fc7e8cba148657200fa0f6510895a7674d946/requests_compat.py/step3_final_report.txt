  "purpose": "Setup environment, handle imports, and detect Python version for compatibility.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements, fallback import logic, variable assignments",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows or external outputs identified",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; code primarily initializes variables and imports modules",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, redundant assignments, fallback import pattern, no functional logic",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection and import setup with obfuscated variable names. No data processing, network activity, or malicious code is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for compatibility or concealment, but does not indicate malicious intent. No data leaks, code injection, or external communication are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign setup and compatibility code with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (0.5), and overall security risk is low (0.2).",
