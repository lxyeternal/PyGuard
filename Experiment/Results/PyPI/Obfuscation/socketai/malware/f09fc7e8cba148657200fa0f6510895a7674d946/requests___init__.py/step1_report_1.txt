  "purpose": "Description and usage instructions for the Requests HTTP library in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the import statements and function calls (requests.get, requests.post). It also references user-provided URLs and payload data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests (requests.get, requests.post) where untrusted URLs or data could be sent, and the code writes output by printing responses.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input sources (user URLs, payload data) are used directly in requests methods, which could send data to external servers. Output is printed from response objects.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated strings (e.g., JmDCDbKNSSLMiusKvZdrSUOGgOwSJhek, RBdhtNzJdjpElKRtxrTLulwFYWkxhzNE, IgmiKdwysoPfzztPEmgelRXvqQTsGtBq) which appear to be random or encrypted, indicating possible obfuscation. The presence of such strings suggests potential concealment of malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides documentation and usage examples for the Requests library, with references to functions like requests.get and requests.post. Obfuscated strings are present in method calls and variable names, which do not match the standard Requests API. These appear to be intentionally obscured, possibly to hide malicious activity or evade detection. The code does not show any malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration beyond normal HTTP requests, but the obfuscation raises suspicion. Since no actual malicious actions are demonstrated, and the code is mainly documentation, the risk is low but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is mostly documentation for the Requests library, but includes obfuscated strings that could conceal malicious activity. There are no explicit malicious actions shown, but the obfuscation suggests potential intent to hide malicious behavior. Overall, the code poses low immediate risk but warrants further review due to obfuscation.",
