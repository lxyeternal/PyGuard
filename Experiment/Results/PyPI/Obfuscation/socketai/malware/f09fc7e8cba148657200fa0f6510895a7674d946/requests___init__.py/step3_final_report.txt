  "purpose": "Analysis of obfuscated Python code snippets related to the requests library to determine malicious intent, security risks, and obfuscation levels.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated variable names and placeholder strings within code snippets, primarily in function calls and variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests and data handling functions, but no actual malicious data flows are observed.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated source identifiers are used in function calls, but no evidence of data exfiltration or malicious actions is present.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable names and placeholder text, inconsistent code snippets, and lack of functional code.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets contain obfuscated identifiers that do not match standard requests library usage, indicating intentional concealment. No malicious payloads, network connections to suspicious domains, or malicious data handling are demonstrated. The obfuscation is consistent across reports, raising suspicion but not confirming malicious activity. The absence of malicious actions or payloads suggests the code is benign but intentionally obfuscated, warranting caution. The scores assigned reflect high obfuscation (0.75), low malware likelihood (0.1), and low overall security risk (0.3).",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with no evidence of malicious payloads or active malicious behavior. While obfuscation raises suspicion, the lack of concrete malicious activity indicates a low threat level. Continuous monitoring is recommended, especially if further code or context is provided.",
