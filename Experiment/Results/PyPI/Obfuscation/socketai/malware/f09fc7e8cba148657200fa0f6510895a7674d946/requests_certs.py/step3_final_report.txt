  "purpose": "Describes the default CA bundle used by requests, referencing requests.certs.",
  "sources": "Attribute access to requests.certs, embedded comments with placeholder or obfuscated text.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; no data leaks or malicious data flows.",
  "flows": "None; the code is primarily a comment or attribute reference without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder or corrupted-looking strings such as 'MhgPnDLctqwNnfwrzqMqNjvuPePBjqUS...' and similar nonsensical text.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is mainly a descriptive comment referencing requests.certs. The embedded strings appear to be placeholder or corrupted data, not active code or malicious payloads. No executable logic, data processing, or data flow involving untrusted sources is present. The anomalies are consistent across multiple reports and seem to be artifacts of obfuscation or corruption rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily a comment with some suspicious placeholder text. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or active security threats. The obfuscation scores are justified given the anomalies, but overall, the code poses minimal risk.",
