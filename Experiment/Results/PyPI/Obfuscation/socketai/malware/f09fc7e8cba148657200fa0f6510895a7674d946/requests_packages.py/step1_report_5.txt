  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a basic Python script that performs some data processing or interaction with external systems, but without specific context, its exact function is unclear.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from user prompts, environment variables, or external files; network requests or API calls if present.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive operations such as network communications, file writes, or execution of commands that could process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (actions or outputs), possibly passing through processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No signs of obfuscated code or unusual language features. The code structure appears straightforward. However, absence of detailed code prevents full assessment.",
  "analysis": "The provided code lacks visible hardcoded secrets, obfuscated segments, or malicious constructs. Without specific code snippets, the review focuses on general risk factors. If the code involves user input handling, network access, or command execution, those areas should be scrutinized for unsafe practices. As no suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are evident, and the code appears standard, the risk level is low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, there are no clear indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to perform standard data processing tasks with no evident supply chain threats. However, the absence of detailed code limits full certainty.",
