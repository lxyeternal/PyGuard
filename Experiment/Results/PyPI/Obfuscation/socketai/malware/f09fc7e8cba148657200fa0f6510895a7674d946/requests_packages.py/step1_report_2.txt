  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly clear from the provided fragment, but it appears to be a standard Python script that might involve data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables and possibly user input or files (though not explicitly shown in the fragment).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or output functions if present, but none are explicitly shown in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are observable in the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard; no hidden backdoors or suspicious constructs are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment is minimal and appears to be standard Python without any malicious or suspicious constructs. There are no indications of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection. The structure and syntax are straightforward, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. Lack of network activity, no eval or exec functions used, and no sensitive data handling suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign with no suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors detected.",
