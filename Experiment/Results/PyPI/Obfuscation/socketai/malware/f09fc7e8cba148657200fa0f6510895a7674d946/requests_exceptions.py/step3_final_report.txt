{
  "purpose": "The code defines a series of custom exception classes, many with obfuscated names and static string attributes, likely for error handling or concealment.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'urllib3.exceptions' and '.compat' modules; class definitions with static string attributes; inheritance from standard exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No data input, network calls, or external data processing observed; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No active data flow or external interactions; primarily class inheritance and static attribute definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names and static string attributes with nonsensical or random values; lack of functional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with obfuscated names and static strings, with no active behavior, data flow, or external interactions. The obfuscation appears intentional, possibly to conceal purpose, but no malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation is evident. The high obfuscation scores reflect the naming patterns, while the low malware and risk scores are justified by the absence of active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not currently indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score is high due to naming patterns, and the risk score is low given the lack of active threats.",
