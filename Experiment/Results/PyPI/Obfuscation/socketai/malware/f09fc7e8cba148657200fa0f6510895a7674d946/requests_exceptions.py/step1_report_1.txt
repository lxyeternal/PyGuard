  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and import exceptions, possibly for error handling or extension in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions, local compatibility module, and various class definitions with hardcoded string attributes.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources within the provided code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code consists solely of class definitions and attribute assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of multiple classes with randomly generated names and string attributes that seem arbitrary; no functional logic or data processing shown.",
  "analysis": "The code defines numerous classes, mostly inheriting from existing exceptions or custom base classes, with no apparent logic, data manipulation, or external interactions. The attribute names and string values appear random or obfuscated, suggesting possible concealment. The imports are limited to exception classes, and no network, file, or user input handling is evident. The structure does not indicate malicious behavior, but the obfuscated class names and random strings could be an attempt to hide intent or functionality. No actual malicious activities such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system manipulation are detectable from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of obfuscated class definitions with no immediate malicious behavior or security risks identified. It may be part of a larger codebase where these classes serve specific purposes, but in isolation, it does not demonstrate malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
