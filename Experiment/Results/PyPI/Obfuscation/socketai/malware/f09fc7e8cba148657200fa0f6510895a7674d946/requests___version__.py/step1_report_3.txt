  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a Python script intended to perform a specific task, but without additional context or comments, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input is likely read from environment variables or user input prompts, but no explicit sources are visible in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but none are explicitly evident in the provided fragment.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are visible due to the lack of detailed code content.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment provided is minimal or possibly incomplete, lacking discernible data sources, sinks, or control flow. Without more context or code content, it is difficult to identify malicious behavior or security issues. The structure appears standard; no obfuscation or malicious patterns are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. The code appears benign, but the limited information restricts comprehensive analysis.",
