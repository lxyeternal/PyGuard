  "conclusion": "The dependency contains some code with suspicious patterns such as obfuscation, dynamic execution, and network activity, especially in reports 2 and 5, indicating a high likelihood of malicious behavior. Other reports are benign or ambiguous. The scoring aligns with the evidence, suggesting a moderate to high threat level primarily driven by reports 2 and 5."
