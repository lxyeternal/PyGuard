The high likelihood of malicious intent, combined with the remote IPs and execution patterns, warrants classifying this as malware with high security risk."

The obfuscation warrants caution but does not currently indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score is high due to naming patterns, and the risk score is low given the lack of active threats."

No explicit malicious activity is confirmed, but the obfuscation warrants further static and dynamic analysis before trusting or deploying. The scores reflect moderate suspicion due to obfuscation, with malware risk estimated at 0.5, obfuscation at 0.8, and overall security risk at 0.6."

Other reports are benign or ambiguous. The scoring aligns with the evidence, suggesting a moderate to high threat level primarily driven by reports 2 and 5."
