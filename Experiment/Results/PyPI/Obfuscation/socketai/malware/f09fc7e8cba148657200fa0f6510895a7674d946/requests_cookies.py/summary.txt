  "conclusion": "The code is likely a legitimate compatibility layer but is heavily obfuscated, raising suspicion of potential malicious concealment. No explicit malicious activity is confirmed, but the obfuscation warrants further static and dynamic analysis before trusting or deploying. The scores reflect moderate suspicion due to obfuscation, with malware risk estimated at 0.5, obfuscation at 0.8, and overall security risk at 0.6."
