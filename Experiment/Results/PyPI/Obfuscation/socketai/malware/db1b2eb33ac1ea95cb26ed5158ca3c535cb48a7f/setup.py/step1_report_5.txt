{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with dependencies and metadata, and includes obfuscated code likely used to execute additional, potentially malicious, code.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated base64-encoded string decoded and executed via dynamically compiled code, and environment variables via os module.",
  "sinks": "exec and compile functions executing decoded code, potentially running malicious scripts; use of __import__('builtins').exec and compile is a high-risk sink.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoding -> compilation -> execution of arbitrary code; possibly reading environment variables and executing malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code using base64 decoding and dynamic execution; variable names are nonsensical; no documentation for the purpose of the decoded code; use of exec/compile with decoded content indicates attempt to hide behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports OS and sys modules, then uses dynamic import and execution techniques to decode and execute a base64-encoded string. The encoded string, once decoded, is compiled and executed, which can run arbitrary code. The base64 string decodes to a series of import statements and functions that could include malicious behavior, such as connecting to external servers or executing harmful commands. The rest of the script appears to be standard setup code for a Python package, but the obfuscated code execution is a significant red flag. The presence of dynamic code execution without clear purpose strongly suggests malicious intent or sabotage. No other malicious activity like hardcoded credentials, network connections, or backdoors is directly observable outside the obfuscated payload.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated base64-encoded content that is decoded, compiled, and executed dynamically, representing a high risk of malicious behavior. The rest of the code is standard package setup, but the obfuscated code execution is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
