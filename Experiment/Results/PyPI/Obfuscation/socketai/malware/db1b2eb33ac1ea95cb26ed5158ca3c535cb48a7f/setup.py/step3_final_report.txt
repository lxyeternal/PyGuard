{
  "purpose": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string, compiles it, and executes it dynamically, which is a common obfuscation technique often used to hide malicious payloads. It then proceeds with a standard setup for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded via 'b64decode', then compiled and executed through 'exec()'.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec()' function which executes the decoded and compiled code at runtime.",
  "flows": "Base64 string decoded -> compiled -> executed via exec() -> runs the payload code which imports modules, writes to URLs, and performs network/file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding, dynamic compilation, and execution of obfuscated code, which are typical indicators of malicious intent. The payload imports modules like 'tempfile', 'sys', 'urllib.request' and interacts with URLs, suggesting potential data exfiltration or remote code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code employs obfuscation through base64 encoding and dynamic execution, which are techniques used to hide malicious behavior. The decoded payload imports modules associated with file and network operations, indicating potential malicious activity such as data exfiltration or remote command execution. The setup code appears benign but is overshadowed by the suspicious payload. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8-0.9, obfuscated ~0.9, risk ~0.85-0.9) are justified given the obfuscation and potential for malicious actions. Static analysis of the payload is recommended for confirmation, but current evidence strongly suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically executed payloads that are highly suspicious and likely malicious. The high obfuscation and malware scores are justified. It should be treated as potentially malicious until further static or dynamic analysis confirms safety.",
