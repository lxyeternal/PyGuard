{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package named 'mljst2qnumrqodv2' with specific dependencies and metadata, and includes obfuscated code that decodes and executes base64-encoded Python code, which potentially loads and runs additional scripts.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the embedded base64-encoded string, environment variables (via os), and potentially from external package dependencies (like 'wheel') and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically decoded code using exec, which can execute arbitrary code. Also, import statements and setup configuration are typical sinks for malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded and compiled, then executed via exec, which could load malicious code. The use of __import__('builtins').exec(__import__('builtins').compile(...)) indicates a source-to-sink flow where encoded payload is decoded and executed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code using base64 decoding and dynamic execution, which is often used to hide malicious intent. The base64 string decodes to code that imports modules, writes to a URL, and closes streams—potentially malicious behavior. The variable names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' and then executes dynamically decoded code. The base64 string decodes to code that imports 'tempfile', 'sys', 'urllib.request', and 'os', then writes a URL to a temporary file, and closes the stream, suggesting data exfiltration or remote code download. The setup section registers a package with metadata, which appears legitimate, but the obfuscated code executed beforehand is suspicious. The use of exec with dynamically decoded code is a common malware technique to conceal malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The script includes obfuscated code that executes arbitrary decoded payload, which may perform malicious actions such as data exfiltration or remote code execution. The presence of obfuscation and dynamic code execution significantly increases suspicion of malicious intent, despite the seemingly benign setup configuration.",
