{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package named 'mljst2qnumrqodv2' with some descriptive metadata and dependencies. It also executes obfuscated code at runtime, which may be intended for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from base64-encoded string decoded and executed via exec, as well as standard import statements.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes dynamically decoded code, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "Base64-decoded string is compiled and executed dynamically, leading to potentially malicious code execution at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__('builtins').exec() with base64 decoding and compilation indicates obfuscation and potential malicious intent. No explicit hardcoded credentials, but dynamic code execution is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code first imports modules os and builtins, then executes a base64-encoded string after decoding and compiling it. This string, when decoded, imports 'tempfile', 'base64', and 'sys', then writes some content to a temporary file, opens a URL, and reads from it. The code uses dynamic execution, which is often associated with obfuscation or malicious behavior. Afterwards, it performs setup for a Python package with metadata and dependencies. The obfuscated exec() call is the primary concern, as it hides potentially malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The script is primarily obfuscated and employs dynamic code execution, which is suspicious and could be malicious. The setup code itself appears benign, but the presence of runtime code decoding and execution suggests a high potential for malicious behavior. Further static analysis of the decoded payload is recommended.",
