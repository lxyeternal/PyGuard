  "conclusion": "The package contains a heavily obfuscated payload decoded from base64 and executed at import time, indicating malicious intent. The remaining functions are UI utilities that could be benign but are likely used to mask malicious activity. The overall security risk is high, and the malware suspicion is justified."
