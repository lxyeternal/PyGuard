{
  "purpose": "The code provides terminal styling, animation, and UI utilities, including functions for text effects, cursor control, and animated displays.",
  "sources": "User input prompts, terminal size queries, environment info, and base64-encoded payload decoded and executed at startup.",
  "sinks": "System calls for terminal control, stdout writes, and execution of dynamically decoded code via exec().",
  "flows": "Base64 payload decoded and executed via compile() and exec(); user input and terminal info influence display functions; decoded payload runs at startup.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated code, meaningless variable names, and a base64-encoded string decoded and executed dynamically during import, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code heavily obfuscates its intent, with functions for terminal styling and animation that appear benign but are coupled with a decoded payload executed at startup. The initial payload's execution via exec() of a base64 string is a classic indicator of malicious activity. The obfuscation and dynamic code execution suggest an attempt to hide malicious routines. The rest of the code appears to be utility functions, but the critical concern is the payload execution, which is a red flag for malware.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains a heavily obfuscated payload decoded from base64 and executed at import time, indicating malicious intent. The remaining functions are UI utilities that could be benign but are likely used to mask malicious activity. The overall security risk is high, and the malware suspicion is justified.",
