{
  "purpose": "This code provides various utility functions for terminal manipulation, text formatting, animated text display, and visual effects, likely intended for creating dynamic terminal UIs or animations.",
  "sources": "Input is read from user input prompts; terminal size queries; some functions accept data via arguments; environment variables are not directly accessed; no external data sources observed.",
  "sinks": "Use of _system('')' and 'system' calls for clearing the screen and setting window titles; writing to stdout; printing animated effects and text manipulations; no external network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "User input flows into terminal functions; data for display is passed via arguments; terminal size and cursor control functions influence display; no flow from untrusted external sources to sensitive sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive obfuscation with unusual class and function naming; encoded strings executed dynamically; functions contain placeholder or dummy code (e.g., empty function definitions, unused variables); the code includes a base64-encoded payload decoded and executed at startup, which could be malicious or obfuscate malicious intent. Additionally, some class and method structures are convoluted and hard to interpret.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a dynamically decoded and executed base64 payload, which might execute malicious code. Subsequent code provides terminal UI utilities, with functions for cursor hiding, showing, setting titles, and animated text output, all common in terminal UI libraries but also often used for malicious obfuscation. The obfuscated and unconventional naming, combined with dummy functions and encoded payload, indicates intent to hide malicious activity. No network activity, file operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are directly visible. Overall, the code's structure and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent or at least suspicious activity, especially considering the initial payload execution.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains heavily obfuscated code with a base64 payload executed at startup, which is a major red flag. While much of the code appears to be utilities for terminal UI animations and text formatting, the presence of encoded payload execution suggests malicious behavior or sabotage. Caution is advised against using or distributing this package without further analysis.",
