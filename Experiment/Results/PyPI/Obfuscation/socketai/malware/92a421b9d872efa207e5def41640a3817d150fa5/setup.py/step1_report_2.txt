{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be setting up a Python package but also executes a potentially malicious PowerShell command in the background.",
  "sources": "The code reads the file system with os.path.exists and attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executes a PowerShell encoded command, which could lead to remote code execution or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "The script checks for the existence of a file 'tahg'; if not present, it launches the encoded PowerShell command, which could execute arbitrary code, then proceeds to run setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a base64-encoded PowerShell command executed in the background with hidden window style; no comments or documentation explaining this behavior; the command is obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing setup from distutils, a standard build tool. It then attempts to import subprocess and os modules. If a file named 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64. This command is likely obfuscated, making its purpose unclear without decoding. The command is executed asynchronously, potentially allowing malicious code to run without user awareness. The setup call is standard for package configuration, but the background execution of encoded PowerShell suggests malicious intent or sabotage. The code catches all exceptions silently, which could hide errors or malicious failures. Overall, the script contains suspicious behavior due to the encoded remote execution command, with no legitimate context provided.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a standard setup process but is heavily suspicious because of the encoded PowerShell command executed silently in the background, which could be malicious. This behavior indicates a high risk of malicious activity or sabotage embedded within an otherwise benign-looking setup script.",
