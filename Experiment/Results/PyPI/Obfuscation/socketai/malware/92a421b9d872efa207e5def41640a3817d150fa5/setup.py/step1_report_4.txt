{
  "purpose": "The script is intended to set up a Python package and potentially execute a hidden process during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the filesystem ('tahg' directory check) and executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "Execution of a PowerShell command which, if malicious, could perform harmful actions or download additional payloads.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the existence of 'tahg'; if absent, it runs a hidden PowerShell command that appears to decode and execute base64-encoded instructions.",
  "anomalies": "The embedded PowerShell command is encoded in base64, which is often used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed silently with no window, and the code suppresses exceptions. The purpose of the encoded command is unclear, but such obfuscation is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup and attempting to import subprocess and os modules. It checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists. If not, it runs a PowerShell command encoded in base64, executed with no window and without error reporting. The setup() call is standard for packaging, but the preceding code executes a hidden process that could be malicious. The use of encoded commands and silent execution are typical in malicious scripts to evade detection. The code does not verify or sanitize any data, and the purpose of the PowerShell command is hidden, raising suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed to execute a concealed PowerShell payload during package installation, which could be malicious. The obfuscated command and silent execution are suspicious, indicating a high potential for malicious behavior. The setup process itself is normal, but the embedded payload warrants caution.",
