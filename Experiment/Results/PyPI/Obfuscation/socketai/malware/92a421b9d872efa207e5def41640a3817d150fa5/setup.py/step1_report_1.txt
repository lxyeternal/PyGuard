{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be setting up a Python package, but includes hidden code intended to execute malicious PowerShell commands upon installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existence of the 'tahg' directory and potentially executes a subprocess with a PowerShell command encoded in base64.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command that is encoded, which could lead to remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "If the 'tahg' directory does not exist, the script triggers the subprocess which runs a PowerShell command encoded in base64, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command within a subprocess without transparency, combined with the check for directory existence as a trigger. The code also suppresses exceptions silently, hiding potential errors. The setup function appears normal but is a cover for malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code first checks if the directory 'tahg' exists. If not, it executes a subprocess running a PowerShell command encoded in base64. This command is hidden and obfuscated, indicating potential malicious intent. The PowerShell command likely downloads or executes remote code, typical of malicious payloads. The setup function is standard but used here as a cover. Exception handling is silent, which conceals errors that could reveal malicious activity. The overall structure suggests an attempt to execute hidden malicious code during installation, possibly for backdoor access or remote control.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell command execution triggered during package installation, indicating malicious intent. It appears designed to run hidden, potentially harmful code without user awareness. The setup function's normal appearance is misleading. Overall, this code is highly suspicious with a malware score of 0.85.",
