{
  "purpose": "A minimal setup script defining package name, version, and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated package name variable, version variable, and dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "Potential misuse of dependencies such as 'browser_cookie3' and 'discordwebhook' if misused post-installation.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated package name and dependencies are declared during setup; no runtime data flow or malicious activity present.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and package name, which may be intended to conceal intent but do not constitute malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with obfuscated identifiers. No executable logic, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. Dependencies could be misused but are not malicious in this context. Obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive of malicious intent. The scores from reports align with this assessment, indicating low malware likelihood and moderate obfuscation concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a package setup script with obfuscation that could be used to conceal intent. No active malicious activity is present. The overall security risk is low, with potential for misuse if dependencies are exploited post-installation.",
