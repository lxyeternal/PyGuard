  "conclusion": "Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent. The only adjustment recommended is increasing the malware score in Report 3 from 0.4 to 0.5 to better reflect the suspicion level due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution. The other scores are appropriate given the evidence. No further changes are necessary."
