  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, external files, network operations, dynamic code execution, suspicious imports, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic execution points, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or external inputs flow into code execution, network transmission, or data storage points.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, dynamic execution, suspicious imports, hardcoded secrets, unusual variable usage, inconsistent code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or absent in Report 1, with no suspicious features. Report 2 describes straightforward code with no malicious patterns, assigning low security risk. Report 3 contains obfuscated code, dynamic execution, and suspicious imports, indicating potential malicious intent; the scores reflect moderate suspicion. Reports 4 and 5 lack code, appropriately scoring zero. The scores in all reports are consistent with their descriptions. Given the obfuscation and dynamic execution in Report 3, a slightly higher malware suspicion score is justified; thus, increasing from 0.4 to 0.5 improves accuracy. The obfuscation score of 0.7 and risk score of 0.65 are appropriate, considering the described features.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent. The only adjustment recommended is increasing the malware score in Report 3 from 0.4 to 0.5 to better reflect the suspicion level due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution. The other scores are appropriate given the evidence. No further changes are necessary.",
