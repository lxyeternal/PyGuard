  "purpose": "This code defines a simple function that prints a static message, serving as a basic example or placeholder.",
  "sources": "No input sources, data reads, or external data dependencies are present.",
  "sinks": "The print statement is a benign sink with no data leakage or external communication.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the function executes a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static function with no inputs, no external dependencies, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The code lacks any complex logic, data flows, or external communications that could pose security concerns. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and no scoring adjustments are necessary.",
