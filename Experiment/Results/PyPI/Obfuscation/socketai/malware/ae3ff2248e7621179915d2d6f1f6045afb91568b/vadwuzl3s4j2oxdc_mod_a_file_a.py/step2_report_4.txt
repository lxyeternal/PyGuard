  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Issue presence**: The code is a simple function that prints a static message. No inputs, no external data, no suspicious behavior.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None identified; the report correctly states the benign nature.\n   - **Scores**: confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.  \n     These seem appropriate given the benign description.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same as above; straightforward print function.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: No issues detected; the report's reasoning is consistent.\n   - **Scores**: confidence=1.0, obfuscated=0.0, malware=0.0, securityRisk=0.0  \n     These are reasonable.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Again, a static print function with no external dependencies.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: No flaws or suspicious elements.\n   - **Scores**: confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0  \n     Appropriate.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Issue presence**: No external data, no malicious behavior.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**: confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0  \n     Suitable.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same benign pattern.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**: confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0  \n     Correct.\n\n**Overall Assessment**:\n- All reports consistently identify the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are uniform and appropriate given the simplicity and safety of the code.\n- There are no indications of obfuscation or malware activity.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The malware score should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score should be 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No further action or escalation is necessary.",
