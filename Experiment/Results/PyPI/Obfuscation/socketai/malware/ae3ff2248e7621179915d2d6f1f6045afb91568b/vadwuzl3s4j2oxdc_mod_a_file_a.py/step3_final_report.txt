  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints a static message.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or environment variables are read.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs to standard output via print; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function only performs a static print operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward function with no inputs, external data, or network activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or further scrutiny are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
