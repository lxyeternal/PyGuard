  "conclusion": "Report 4 accurately reflects malicious indicators with justified high scores. Report 2's current malware score is too low given the use of 'eval'/'exec' on untrusted data; increasing it to around 0.7 aligns with the security implications. Other reports are appropriate. Overall, the key adjustment is raising the malware score in Report 2 to acknowledge the significant risk of code injection and potential malicious payloads."
