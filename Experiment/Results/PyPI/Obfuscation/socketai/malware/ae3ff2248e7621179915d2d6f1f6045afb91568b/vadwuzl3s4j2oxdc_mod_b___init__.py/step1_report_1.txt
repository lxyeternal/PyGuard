  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python package module, potentially for utility or functionality delivery, but the specific intent cannot be determined definitively without examining the actual code content.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, function parameters, or external files if present. However, no specific sources are evident in the provided empty code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network communication functions, file writing operations, or system command executions, but none are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks are observable in the provided code, as it is empty.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs in this empty snippet.",
  "analysis": "Since the provided code is empty, there are no sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies to analyze. Without actual code, no malicious behavior or security issues can be identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears benign, but further analysis would require the actual code content.",
