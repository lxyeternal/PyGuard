  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious activity, including remote code execution, external repository cloning, and notification to external services. The obfuscation and hardcoded URLs further suggest malicious intent. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware score should be set to 1 due to the clear malicious behavior."
