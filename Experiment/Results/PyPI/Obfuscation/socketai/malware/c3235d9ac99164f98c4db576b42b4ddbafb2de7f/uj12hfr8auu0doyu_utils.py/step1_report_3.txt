{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform malicious activities including notifying an external service about installation, cloning a potentially malicious repository, and executing a script from it.",
  "sources": "External webhook URL for notifications, network calls via requests.post, repository cloning from GitHub, and subprocess execution of 'bypass.py'.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external webhook (possible data exfiltration), cloning from external repository, executing potentially malicious 'bypass.py' script.",
  "flows": "Webhook URL is used to send notification, repository clone URL is used to fetch code, the code then changes directory and runs 'bypass.py' which could contain malicious payload.",
  "anomalies": "Sending a webhook notification with a suspicious message about a 'reverse_shell', cloning from a remote repository without validation, executing 'bypass.py' directly after cloning without verification, presence of obfuscated function names.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that sends a notification to a Discord webhook indicating a package installation. It then clones a GitHub repository, potentially hosting malicious code, into a local directory. After changing into that directory, it runs a script named 'bypass.py' without any validation or verification, which could execute malicious payloads. The function is invoked only when the script runs as main, indicating intentional execution. The use of obfuscated function names and direct execution of remote code suggest malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to notify an external service upon installation, clone a remote repository possibly containing malicious code, and execute a script without verification, indicating malicious intent and a potential supply chain attack.",
