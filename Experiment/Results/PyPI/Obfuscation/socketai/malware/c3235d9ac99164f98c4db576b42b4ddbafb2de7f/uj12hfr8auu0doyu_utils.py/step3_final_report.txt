{
  "purpose": "The code notifies a Discord webhook about installation, clones a remote Git repository, and executes a script ('bypass.py'), indicating potential malicious activity such as remote code execution or backdoor setup.",
  "sources": "Reading the webhook URL, repository URL, and the execution of 'bypass.py'.",
  "sinks": "Executing 'bypass.py' via subprocess without validation, potential data exfiltration via webhook.",
  "flows": "Webhook URL and repository URL as sources; data flows into network requests and subprocess execution; 'bypass.py' execution as sink.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name and variable names, hardcoded URLs, cloning external repositories without validation, executing remote scripts without sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code posts a notification to a Discord webhook, clones a GitHub repository into a user directory if it doesn't exist, changes directory into it, and runs 'bypass.py' without validation. The use of obfuscated identifiers and hardcoded URLs suggests malicious intent. The actions align with behaviors typical of supply chain attacks, backdoors, or remote code execution. The lack of validation or sanitization increases risk. The obfuscation level is moderate, with obfuscated function names and concealed URLs. The high likelihood of malicious intent is supported by the code's actions and indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious activity, including remote code execution, external repository cloning, and notification to external services. The obfuscation and hardcoded URLs further suggest malicious intent. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware score should be set to 1 due to the clear malicious behavior.",
