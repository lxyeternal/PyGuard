{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for malicious purposes, specifically to notify an external server when installed and to execute a potentially malicious script via a cloned repository.",
  "sources": "Request to external webhook URL, reading from environment variables (implied via os.path and requests), cloning from a GitHub repository, and executing a script 'bypass.py'.",
  "sinks": "Sending data to a Discord webhook (potential data exfiltration notification), running an external script 'bypass.py' which could contain malicious code.",
  "flows": "Installation triggers a webhook notification, cloning a repository from GitHub, changing directory to the cloned repo, executing 'bypass.py'.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a hardcoded webhook URL, clones an external repository from GitHub, and executes a script without validation. It also uses obfuscated function names and variable names, suggesting concealment.",
  "analysis": "The script sends a notification to a Discord webhook indicating installation. It then clones a remote repository from GitHub into a user directory, potentially downloading malicious content. It changes the current working directory to the cloned repo and executes a script named 'bypass.py'. The use of obfuscated function and variable names, along with hardcoded URLs, strongly suggests malicious intent. The code could be used for command and control, data exfiltration, or executing malicious payloads without user consent. The pattern aligns with typical supply chain attack techniques aiming to run malicious code post-installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, including remote notification, repository cloning, and execution of arbitrary scripts. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious activity, indicating that this package is likely malicious or compromised.",
