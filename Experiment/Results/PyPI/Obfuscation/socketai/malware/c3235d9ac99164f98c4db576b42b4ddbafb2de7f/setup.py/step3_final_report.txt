{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to notify an external server of installation, clone a remote repository, and execute a script, all without validation, indicating malicious intent such as backdoor setup or remote control.",
  "sources": "Requests library for webhook notification, git library for cloning, os for directory management, subprocess for executing scripts.",
  "sinks": "Webhook POST request, cloning of remote repository, execution of 'bypass.py' script via subprocess.",
  "flows": "Imports lead to sending webhook notification, cloning repository, changing directory, executing external script, then proceeding with setup.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, hardcoded malicious URLs, cloning from untrusted source, executing external scripts without validation, performing malicious activities outside typical setup routines.",
  "analysis": "The code sends a notification to a Discord webhook indicating malicious activity, clones a suspicious remote repository, executes a potentially malicious script without validation, and uses obfuscated identifiers. These behaviors are characteristic of supply chain attacks or backdoors. The code does not perform any validation or authentication, increasing risk. The hardcoded URLs and obfuscation further suggest malicious intent. The sequence of actions outside normal setup procedures confirms malicious behavior. The signals—hardcoded URLs, remote code execution, obfuscation—are consistent with malicious activity, justifying high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including remote code execution, external communication, and obfuscation. The assigned scores (malware 1, obfuscated 0.8, security risk 1) are justified and reflect the high threat level. The package should be considered malicious and avoided.",
