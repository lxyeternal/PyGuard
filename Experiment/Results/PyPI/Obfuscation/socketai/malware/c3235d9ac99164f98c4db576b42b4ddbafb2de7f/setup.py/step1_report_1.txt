{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with additional malicious activities embedded, such as sending webhook notifications, cloning a remote repository, executing a script, and performing package setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the environment indirectly via the subprocess call and hardcoded URLs; also reads from the filesystem when checking directories.",
  "sinks": "The code sends a webhook via requests, clones a remote Git repository, and executes an external script ('bypass.py') via subprocess.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the initial import and setup, then sends a webhook notification (source) to an external URL (sink); clones a remote repository (source) to local directory (sink); executes 'bypass.py' (source) via subprocess (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The URL in the webhook indicates notification of package installation, possibly malicious. Cloning a remote repository and executing a script without validation suggests malicious intent. Use of obfuscated function and variable names. Hardcoded URLs and paths. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function that sends a webhook notification to a Discord URL, likely indicating someone has installed this package. It then clones a remote GitHub repository into a user directory and runs a script ('bypass.py') from that directory. The setup() call is normal, but the malicious activities occur before it. The use of hardcoded URLs, cloning untrusted repositories, and executing arbitrary scripts are suspicious behaviors. These actions suggest the script is designed to perform unauthorized activities post-installation, such as backdooring or deploying malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior including sending installation notifications to an external webhook, cloning and executing code from a remote repository, which could be used for further malicious actions. The presence of obfuscated names and external communications indicates high malicious potential. This package should not be used.",
