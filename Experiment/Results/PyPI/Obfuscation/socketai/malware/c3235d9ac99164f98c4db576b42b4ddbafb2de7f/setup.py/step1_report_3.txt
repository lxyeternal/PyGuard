{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package and execute some potentially malicious actions, including cloning a Git repository, executing a script, and sending a notification via Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment and filesystem data, such as checking for directory existence and changing directories. It also reads network data through the webhook URL and input files for subprocess execution.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to a Discord webhook, runs an external script ('bypass.py') via subprocess, and clones a remote Git repository, potentially executing malicious scripts.",
  "flows": "Network data flows from the webhook URL and Git repository cloning; filesystem data flows from directory checks to script execution; subprocess execution runs external code potentially downloaded from remote source.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, cloning of a suspicious repository ('updater.git'), execution of a script ('bypass.py') without verification, and a structure that suggests remote command and control capabilities. The purpose of the cloned repo and the script is unclear, raising suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by defining a function that sends a message to a Discord webhook indicating a package installation, which could be used for tracking or malicious notifications. It then clones a remote Git repository from 'NotInfected/updater.git' to a user directory, which could contain malicious code. After cloning, it changes the working directory and executes 'bypass.py' with subprocess.run, potentially running malicious code. The setup function indicates package installation, but the presence of external network communication and code execution raises security concerns. The code's structure suggests malicious intent, especially considering the hardcoded webhook and remote script execution.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains multiple suspicious elements, including hardcoded webhooks, remote cloning and executing scripts, and covert notifications. It likely aims to establish persistence or exfiltrate data, indicating malicious intent.",
