{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform package setup, but also executes potentially malicious actions such as sending a webhook notification, cloning a remote repository, and executing a script from that repository.",
  "sources": "requests.post (webhook notification), os.path.isdir (directory check), git.Repo.clone_from (cloning remote repo), subprocess.run (executing a script from the cloned repo)",
  "sinks": "requests.post (sending data over the network), subprocess.run (executing external script)",
  "flows": "Webhook URL and notification content are sent immediately; remote repo is cloned if directory doesn't exist; then a script ('bypass.py') from the cloned repo is executed",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; sending webhook notifications indicating 'reverse_shell'; cloning and executing code from a remote GitHub repository without validation; hardcoded webhook URL; running a script from a cloned repository without validation or authentication",
  "analysis": "The script starts with standard package setup imports, but then defines a function that sends a notification to a Discord webhook, indicating a 'reverse_shell' installation. It clones a remote GitHub repository to a specific directory if it does not already exist, then changes directory into it and runs a script named 'bypass.py'. The process involves external network communications, remote code execution, and persistent file system modifications. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the sequence of cloning and executing code from an external source is suspicious, suggesting potential malicious intent such as establishing a backdoor or executing malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behaviors including remote code execution, notification of package installation (potentially for tracking or backdoor activation), and remote code retrieval without validation. These activities are characteristic of supply chain attacks or malware, indicating high malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and this package should not be used.",
