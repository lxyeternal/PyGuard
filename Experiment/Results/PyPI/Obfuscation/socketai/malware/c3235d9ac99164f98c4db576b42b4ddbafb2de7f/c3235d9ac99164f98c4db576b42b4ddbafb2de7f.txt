      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including remote code execution, external communication, and obfuscation.

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, with behaviors characteristic of backdoors or remote control mechanisms. It clones external repositories, executes unverified scripts, and notifies external services about reverse shell activity. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware likelihood is near certainty."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious activity, including remote code execution, external repository cloning, and notification to external services. The obfuscation and hardcoded URLs further suggest malicious intent. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware score should be set to 1 due to the clear malicious behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including remote code execution, external communication, and potential backdoor setup. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified. The obfuscation is minimal; only the function name is obfuscated. Overall, this code should be considered highly malicious and pose a significant security threat."
