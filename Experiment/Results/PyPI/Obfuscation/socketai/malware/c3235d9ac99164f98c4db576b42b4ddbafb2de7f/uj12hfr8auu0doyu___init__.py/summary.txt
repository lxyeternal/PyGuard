  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, with behaviors characteristic of backdoors or remote control mechanisms. It clones external repositories, executes unverified scripts, and notifies external services about reverse shell activity. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware likelihood is near certainty."
