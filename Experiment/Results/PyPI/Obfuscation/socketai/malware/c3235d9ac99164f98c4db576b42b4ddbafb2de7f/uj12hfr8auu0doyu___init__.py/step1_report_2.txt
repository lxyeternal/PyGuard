{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to clone a remote Git repository, run a script named 'bypass.py', and send a notification to a Discord webhook indicating a package installation. It may serve as a reverse shell or backdoor mechanism.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the file system (checking/creating directories), makes an HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook, and clones a remote Git repository.",
  "sinks": "The POST request to the Discord webhook can leak information about the package installation. The subprocess runs an external script ('bypass.py'), which could contain malicious payloads. Cloning and executing remote code from the Git repository can introduce malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "Source: Directory check and creation / cloning from Git repository / executing 'bypass.py' -> Sink: Webhook notification, subprocess execution of external script",
  "anomalies": "The code sends a message to a Discord webhook indicating a package has been installed, which could be used for tracking or malicious notification. The repository URL points to 'NotInfected/updater.git', which might be suspicious if the purpose is malicious. Running an external script ('bypass.py') without any validation is risky. The code uses hardcoded URLs and paths, and no error handling is present.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by defining a function that sends a notification to a Discord webhook, likely to signal that the package has been installed. It clones a remote Git repository from 'NotInfected/updater.git' into a user directory if it does not exist, then changes directory to this repository and runs a script named 'bypass.py'. The main execution calls this function. The behavior of cloning and executing remote code combined with sending a notification suggests potential malicious intent, such as establishing persistence or executing malicious scripts. The notification URL and repository URL are suspicious and could be used for command and control or exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious characteristics, including remote code execution, data exfiltration via webhook, and automated remote repository cloning. The presence of executing an external script ('bypass.py') and notifying an external webhook indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent. It functions as a backdoor or reverse shell, making it dangerous to use.",
