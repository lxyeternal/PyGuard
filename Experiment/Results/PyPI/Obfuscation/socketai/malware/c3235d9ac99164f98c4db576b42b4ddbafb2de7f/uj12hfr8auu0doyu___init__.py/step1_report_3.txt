{
  "purpose": "The script appears to clone a remote Git repository and execute a script named 'bypass.py'. It also sends a notification to a Discord webhook indicating the package has been installed, which could be used for tracking or malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local filesystem to check/create directories, and reads remote repositories via git.clone_from. It also takes no explicit untrusted input but contacts external URLs.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to a Discord webhook (potential information leak or command & control), executes a subprocess running a Python script ('bypass.py'), and clones potentially malicious or unauthorized code from a GitHub repository.",
  "flows": "External URLs (Discord webhook and GitHub repo) are accessed. The code clones a remote repo to a local directory and executes a script from that repo, indicating a flow from external sources to local execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code silently clones a remote repository and executes a script without any validation. It reports an installation via a Discord webhook, which could be used for tracking or malicious command-and-control communication. The script name 'bypass.py' suggests possible evasion or malicious intent. Use of hardcoded webhook and remote repo URL, as well as silent execution, are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports several modules, including requests, socket, git, subprocess, and os. It defines a function that sends a notification to a Discord webhook, possibly for tracking installations or activations. It then clones a specific GitHub repository into a local directory if it doesn't exist, and runs a script named 'bypass.py'. These actions are performed automatically when the script runs as '__main__'. The combination of remote cloning, executing potentially unknown code, and notifying via webhook is typical of malicious or backdoor behaviors, especially with a script named 'bypass.py'. There are no input validation or security checks, and all external communications are hardcoded, increasing suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential: it clones and executes remote code without validation, reports activity via a Discord webhook, and runs an external script named 'bypass.py', which strongly suggests malicious or backdoor functionality. The overall security risk is high.",
