{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with a custom installation class that executes potentially malicious code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports modules ('requests', 'fernet'), and executes a decrypted string of code inside the custom install command.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted code (via Fernet decryption) executes dynamic code with 'exec', which could lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'FUVEnIMAVDtikArZJeACkJFeMOoVZzcf' class runs, decrypts a payload, and executes it dynamically, creating a source-to-sink flow that could be malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, encrypted code execution, use of 'exec' with decrypted data, conditional requests module import on Windows, suspicious variable names, and encrypted payload indicate malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration with obfuscated variable names and a custom install command that, when run on Windows, decrypts and executes a payload via Fernet. The decrypted payload is executed directly using 'exec', which is a common technique in malicious code to run hidden payloads. The inclusion of requests and Fernet suggests potential for remote communication or command-and-control, although no explicit network activity is shown in this snippet. The obfuscation and encrypted payload strongly indicate malicious intent, likely to execute remote or malicious code upon installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains obfuscated, encrypted payload execution during installation, indicating likely malicious behavior with potential for remote code execution and system compromise. The presence of encrypted 'exec' payload and obfuscated variables points to sabotage or malware intent.",
