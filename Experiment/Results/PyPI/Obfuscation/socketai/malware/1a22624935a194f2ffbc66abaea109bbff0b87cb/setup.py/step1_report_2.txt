{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package with some obfuscated logic that may perform additional actions during installation.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the environment (os.name), embedded base64-encoded strings, and external modules ('requests', 'fernet').",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of decrypted code via 'exec', network requests through 'requests', and use of 'fernet' for decryption suggest possible data transmission or malicious payload execution.",
  "flows": "If on Windows, the code imports 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypts an embedded string, and executes it with 'exec', which may trigger network activity and code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated strings, encrypted payloads, and conditional execution based on OS indicate suspicious activity. The encrypted data and 'exec' usage are typical of malicious behavior hiding in plain sight.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script with obfuscated variables and an encrypted payload. During installation on Windows, it decrypts a string and executes it, which could be malicious. The use of 'exec' with decrypted data and dynamic imports raises concerns about hidden malicious behavior, such as executing arbitrary code or establishing network connections.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains suspicious obfuscated code that, on Windows systems, decrypts and executes code at install time. The use of encrypted payloads, dynamic execution, and network modules strongly suggest malicious intent or backdoor behavior. It warrants a high security risk assessment and should not be used in production environments.",
