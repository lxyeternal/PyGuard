{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with some obfuscated behavior, possibly to hide malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads the OS environment (os.name), imports requests, and dynamically executes decrypted code via Fernet in the install method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code using exec(), network requests via requests, and potentially executing malicious code when the install command runs.",
  "flows": "The code checks for Windows OS, fetches and decrypts a payload, then executes it dynamically during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload executed via Fernet, dynamic execution of code, encrypted data embedded directly in the source, no clear legitimate reason for such obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script uses non-descriptive variable names and includes an encrypted string that, when decrypted, is executed dynamically. It only runs on Windows and performs a network request or code execution through requests and Fernet decryption. The presence of encrypted code, dynamic execution, and conditional OS check indicates potentially malicious behavior designed to hide its true purpose. These are common tactics for malware or backdoors. The setup process does not clarify the purpose, and the use of obfuscation techniques raises suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious due to obfuscation, encrypted payload, and dynamic code execution that could be malicious. It appears designed to run malicious code during package installation on Windows systems, possibly to establish backdoors or execute harmful operations.",
