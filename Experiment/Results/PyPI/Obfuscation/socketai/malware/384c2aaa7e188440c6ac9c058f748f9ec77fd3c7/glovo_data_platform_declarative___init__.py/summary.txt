  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious-like behavior through covert data collection and exfiltration, employing obfuscation techniques to conceal its intent. While no direct payload or destructive actions are present, the activity is highly suspicious and warrants classification as malicious or at least high-risk. The scores across reports are appropriate, though the malware score in some reports could be slightly increased to better reflect the exfiltration activity. Overall, the code should be treated as malicious with high confidence, and caution is advised when handling or deploying such dependencies."
