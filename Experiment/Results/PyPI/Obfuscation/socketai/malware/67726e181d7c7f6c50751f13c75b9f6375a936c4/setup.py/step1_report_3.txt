{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated code that performs a dynamic evaluation based on encoded and manipulated string data, likely to execute hidden or malicious logic.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys modules, input strings within the function, and the execution of system command 'whoami'.",
  "sinks": "eval() function with dynamically constructed code, system call 'os.system'.",
  "flows": "Input string is processed through complex obfuscation, then passed to eval() which executes arbitrary code; system('whoami') outputs current user, which could be for reconnaissance.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code with complex string manipulation; use of eval() on dynamically generated code; execution of system command 'whoami'; use of global variables; no clear purpose for encoding/decoding logic; the code structure suggests hiding malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines obfuscated functions that manipulate strings based on character codes and perform conditional decoding. The use of eval() on the manipulated string indicates potential execution of arbitrary code, which is a major security concern. The code also runs a system command 'whoami', which could be used for reconnaissance. The overall structure, with heavy obfuscation and dynamic code execution, suggests malicious intent or backdoor behavior. The inclusion of setup() indicates an intended package distribution, but the core logic is suspicious and designed to hide its true function.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears highly suspicious due to obfuscation, use of eval() on dynamically generated code, and execution of system commands. It likely contains malicious behavior or a backdoor mechanism, warranting further review or removal.",
