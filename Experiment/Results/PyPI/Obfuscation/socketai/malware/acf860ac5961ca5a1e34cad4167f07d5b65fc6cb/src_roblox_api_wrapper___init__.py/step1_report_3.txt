  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python package or script that performs some form of data processing or functionality related to the project it belongs to. Without additional context or specific comments, its intent is not entirely clear, but it does not seem inherently malicious.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules, but no explicit sources such as user input, files, or network inputs are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or execution functions, but no suspicious or sensitive operations are evident within the visible code.",
  "flows": "The code flow appears straightforward: it processes data passed to functions or modules without complex or unusual source-to-sink paths. No evidence of data leakage or malicious data handling is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are detected. The code uses standard Python features and libraries. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python functions and data processing routines. No suspicious imports or unusual behaviors are detected. It does not perform any network activity, file tampering, or system modification. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are apparent. The overall structure and format are typical of normal Python scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign and safe for use. However, this conclusion is based solely on the visible code; additional context or hidden code could alter this assessment.",
