  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform data processing or system management tasks, but without additional context, its specific goal is unclear.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, input functions, or external libraries that may read user input or system data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file write operations, or subprocess calls that could lead to data leakage or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables) to sinks (network, file, subprocess) through intermediate processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. No suspicious dynamic code execution or unusual variable usage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed in its entirety. It uses standard libraries and functions without signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity detected. The structure is typical of legitimate scripts, with no indicators of malicious intent. Potential security risks are minimal, but without further context, a full security assessment cannot be guaranteed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no apparent signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, but further context could provide more confidence.",
