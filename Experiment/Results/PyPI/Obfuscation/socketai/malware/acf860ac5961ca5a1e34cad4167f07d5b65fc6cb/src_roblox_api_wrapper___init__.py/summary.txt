  "conclusion": "Report 1 presents behaviors consistent with potentially malicious code, justified by high obfuscation and risky functions, warranting a malware score of 0.6–0.7. Other reports are benign, with scores appropriately low. Overall, the scoring aligns with the code behaviors described, with no major inconsistencies. Slight adjustment of Report 1's malware score to 0.7 could improve accuracy, but current scores are acceptable."
