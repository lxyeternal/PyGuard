{
  "purpose": "The functions appear to be placeholders for authentication-related operations, possibly login or session management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'cookie', 'username', and 'password', which could potentially be supplied from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No active code or data processing occurs within the functions; they are empty.",
  "flows": "No actual data flow is implemented; parameters are not processed or transferred to any other part of the code.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation; no code execution, data manipulation, or side effects are present. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated content detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two function definitions with empty bodies. There are no operations, data handling, or external calls. The presence of placeholder functions might suggest future development but currently pose no security risk or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign in its current state. It does not perform any actions, does not contain malicious logic, and does not reveal any security issues. The functions are stubs, possibly for future implementation, but as-is, there is no malicious activity or security concern.",
