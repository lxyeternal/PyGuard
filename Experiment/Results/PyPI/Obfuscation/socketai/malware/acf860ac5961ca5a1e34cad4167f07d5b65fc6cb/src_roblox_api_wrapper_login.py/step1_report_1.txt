  "purpose": "Placeholder functions potentially intended for authentication or session management, but currently non-functional.",
  "sources": "None; functions do not contain any code that reads input, environment variables, or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; functions are empty and do not perform any actions, including data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as functions are empty; no source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined with descriptive names suggesting security-related operations but contain no implementation or code. No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions with obscure, seemingly randomly generated names, which might suggest obfuscation or autogenerated code. Both functions are empty and do not perform any operations, data handling, or security-relevant actions. There are no inputs processed, no outputs generated, and no control flow or data flow present. The absence of code means there are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security issues observable at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is non-functional and contains no executable logic, data handling, or security-relevant behavior. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The function names might suggest future use or obfuscation, but currently, the code appears benign and inactive.",
