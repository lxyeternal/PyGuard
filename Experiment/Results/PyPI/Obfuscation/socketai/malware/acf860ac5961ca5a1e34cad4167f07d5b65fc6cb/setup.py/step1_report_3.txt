{
  "purpose": "The code appears to download a file from a remote URL and execute it on the local machine, then schedule a system restart. It also manipulates startup scripts to persist execution.",
  "sources": "URL retrieval from 'https://frvezdff.pythonanywhere.com/getrnr', environment variables (APPDATA), and command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "Writing to files in APPDATA and Startup directories, executing downloaded script via subprocess, and system shutdown command",
  "flows": "URL download -> save to APPDATA\\bbb.bat -> possibly copy to Startup -> execute bbb.bat -> system restart",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name, unusual variable names, use of hardcoded URL, copying batch file to startup for persistence, forced system shutdown, download and execute potentially malicious script",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a package setup and then defines a function that retrieves a script from a suspicious URL and saves it to the APPDATA directory as 'bbb.bat'. It then attempts to copy this batch file into the Windows startup folder to ensure persistence. After a brief sleep, it executes the batch file without a window and schedules a system restart. The use of obfuscated function and variable names suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code's behavior—downloading an external script, persistence mechanisms, and forced restart—are typical of malware aiming to maintain control and potentially execute harmful payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and exhibits typical malicious behavior, including external code download, persistence setup, and system restart, indicating it is likely malware designed to compromise and control the infected system.",
