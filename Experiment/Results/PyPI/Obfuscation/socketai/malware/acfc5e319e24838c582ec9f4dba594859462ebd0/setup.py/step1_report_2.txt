{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that also performs some network communication and file writing during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the filesystem (README.md, __file__), environment variables (os.uname()), and external requests (requests.get('https://api.ipify.org') and requests.get('https://kotko.org?') with encoded data).",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external URLs ('https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org?') with potentially encoded data; writing to 'bykotko.txt' file during the installation process.",
  "flows": "Input from filesystem and environment variables is combined, encoded, and sent via HTTP GET requests to external servers during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual activity during installation: writing to a file 'bykotko.txt', making external HTTP requests, encoding and sending system information, and making network calls with base64-encoded data. The code also constructs a URL with an obscure package name and custom URL parameters, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that registers a function to run at exit, which performs several malicious-looking actions: writing to a file, collecting system and external IP information, encoding it in base64, and sending it via GET request to external domains. The URL 'https://kotko.org' appears suspicious, especially with appended encoded data. The code dynamically accesses system info and makes network calls during package installation, which is uncommon and potentially malicious. The obfuscated variable names and behavior suggest intent to hide activity. No malicious code or payloads such as reverse shells or system damage are explicitly present, but the network activity and data exfiltration during installation are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior related to data collection and exfiltration during the package installation process. It writes files, retrieves system info, encodes data, and sends it to external servers, which is indicative of potential malicious activity or at least covert data collection. The overall behavior warrants caution, as it could be used for tracking or information theft.",
