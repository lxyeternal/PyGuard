{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with additional functions that perform network requests and write to a file during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the IP address from an external API ('https://api.ipify.org'), and reads the current system's hostname and path information.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data (IP address, hostname, and path info) to an external URL ('https://kotko.org') via a GET request with encoded parameters. It also writes to a local file 'kotko.txt'.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom install class executes 'IlgFbRJSuaefpcRHNJFcHZVXKNcYHWso', which collects system info and sends it externally, while also writing 'kotko' into a file.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends system info (public IP, hostname, path) to an external server during package installation without user consent. It encodes and transmits data via base64 in a URL, which could be used to obfuscate malicious intent. The naming of variables and functions appears deliberately obfuscated, and the package name is nonsensical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script augmented with a malicious payload. It registers a function to run at exit that collects system data (public IP, hostname, install path), encodes this data in base64, and sends it to a suspicious domain. It also writes a string into a file called 'kotko.txt'. The obfuscated variable names and the transmission of system info suggest an intent to exfiltrate data covertly during package installation. No other malicious behaviors such as reverse shells, file damage, or crypto-mining are present. The core malicious activity hinges on the data collection and external communication during install.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior aimed at exfiltrating system information during package installation, with obfuscated code and data transmission to a suspicious domain. This indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent related to privacy invasion and potential supply chain attack.",
