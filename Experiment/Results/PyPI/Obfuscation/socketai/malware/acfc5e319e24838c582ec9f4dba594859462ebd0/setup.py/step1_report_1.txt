{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with additional functions that perform network requests and write to a file during installation.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org' for retrieving external IP address and sending data, reading the current file's path, and writing to 'kotko.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external URLs, writing to 'kotko.txt', and potentially exposing system information via network requests and data encoding.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code retrieves the external IP, system hostname, encodes this information, and sends it via HTTP GET requests to external servers ('kotko.org' and 'api.ipify.org'). It also writes 'kotko' to a local file.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes network activity during package setup, writing to a file with a benign name, and encoding system info before sending. The URL 'https://kotko.org' appears suspicious and is used to transmit system details, which is uncommon and potentially malicious. The code constructs URL parameters with encoded system info and sends it to an external domain, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the 'install' class from setuptools to execute a function upon installation. The function 'IlgFbRJSuaefpcRHNJFcHZVXKNcYHWso' gathers system info: external IP via 'api.ipify.org', system hostname, and the script directory path. It encodes this info in base64 and sends it to 'https://kotko.org' with custom URL parameters. Additionally, it writes 'kotko' to a local text file. These behaviors are unusual for a package setup script and suggest potential privacy invasion or malicious data exfiltration. The external URL 'kotko.org' is suspicious and not a standard domain for package installation or telemetry. The code does not contain obvious backdoors or malware payloads beyond this suspicious network activity, but the intent appears to be tracking or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes malicious-like behavior by collecting and transmitting system and network information during package installation to an external domain. This indicates potential privacy violations and malicious intent, likely aimed at user tracking or data exfiltration. The rest of the code is typical for a setup script, but the network activity raises security concerns.",
