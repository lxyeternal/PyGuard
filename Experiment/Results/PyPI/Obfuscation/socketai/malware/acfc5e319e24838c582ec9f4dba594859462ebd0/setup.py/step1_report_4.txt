{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with additional functions that execute during installation, possibly for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment details and external data through requests.get calls, particularly 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org'. It also reads the current file's directory and external configuration files.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to an external URL ('https://kotko.org') with base64-encoded data containing the IP address, hostname, and file path. It also writes to a file 'kotko.txt' during exit.",
  "flows": "The code gathers system info and IP address, encodes and transmits this data to an external server via an HTTP GET request, potentially leaking user/system information. It also writes to a local file during cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical. The code performs network requests to suspicious or unknown domains ('kotko.org') during installation. It encodes and sends system info without clear purpose. The code writes 'kotko' to a file named 'kotko.txt' upon exit, which appears unnecessary and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a setup script for a package but includes an install class that registers an exit function. This function collects the system's IP address, hostname, and directory path, encodes this data in base64, and sends it to an external server ('kotko.org') via a GET request. It also writes a simple string to a file during the program's exit. The obfuscated variable names and the data exfiltration behavior suggest malicious intent. The script does not perform any apparent legitimate setup tasks with this network activity, indicating possible data theft or malicious tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, primarily data exfiltration of system information to an external domain during installation. The obfuscation, combined with network activity and file writing outside typical setup routines, indicates an attempt to secretly collect user/system data. It is highly suspicious and should not be used in production.",
