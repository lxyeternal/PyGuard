{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with some additional functions executed during installation that perform network requests and write to files.",
  "sources": "Input sources include 'requests.get' to fetch the external IP address and perform a GET request to a remote server, as well as reading the current script file path and writing to 'kotko.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via GET request parameters to 'https://kotko.org' with base64-encoded information, and a file 'kotko.txt' is written locally. These actions could leak environment info or system details.",
  "flows": "The script collects system and network info (IP, hostname, file path), encodes it, and transmits it to an external server. It also writes 'kotko' to a local file during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs network requests to unknown domains, encodes system information, and transmits it to an external URL without any clear user consent or purpose. The use of base64 encoding and dynamic data collection is suspicious. The variable names are obfuscated, and the code performs side effects during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that registers a cleanup function via 'atexit'. The function 'IlgFbRJSuaefpcRHNJFcHZVXKNcYHWso' fetches the public IP address, gathers hostname and script path info, encodes this data, and sends it to 'https://kotko.org' with a specific URL pattern. It also writes 'kotko' to a local file 'kotko.txt'. These actions occur during package installation, which is unusual for standard setup scripts and can be used for tracking or exfiltration of system information without user knowledge. No malicious payload such as remote code execution, file modification, or destructive actions is observed, but the behavior indicates potential privacy invasion or tracking. The code is obfuscated with variable names that appear intentionally meaningless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a setup script that includes functions which collect system information and transmit it to an external server during package installation. This behavior is suspicious and may violate user privacy or serve as a backdoor mechanism. The code does not contain direct malware like system damage or data theft, but its side effects and data exfiltration are concerning.",
