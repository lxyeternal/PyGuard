      "conclusion": "The script exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, including potential data exfiltration, remote payload delivery, and obfuscation designed to evade detection. The combination of network activity during setup, obfuscated code, and data handling indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior, warranting caution and further investigation."

      "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect their described behaviors. Reports 1 and 4 show signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting moderate suspicion (malware scores around 0.2–0.3 if unconfirmed). Other reports are benign with low scores. Adjustments should be made based on actual code inspection, but current assessments are reasonable given the summaries."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of linear regression analysis with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0.8, and risk score of 0.2 are justified and consistent with the analysis."
