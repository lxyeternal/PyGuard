{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up and configure a Python package, with some additional code that appears to perform potentially malicious actions such as retrieving and executing encoded payloads, and exfiltrating data over network connections.",
  "sources": "Data is read from hardcoded base64-encoded strings, system platform information, and external files like 'README.md'. The code also reads files from user directories, decodes embedded base64 strings, and potentially collects system-specific information.",
  "sinks": "The code creates HTTP/HTTPS connections to external servers, sends file data via POST requests, and executes system commands through os.system. It also loads potentially encoded payloads and executes them, indicating possible data exfiltration or remote command execution.",
  "flows": "Sources such as encoded strings and file reads lead to decoding steps, which are then used to establish network connections and send data. Payloads decoded from base64 are transmitted over network connections. System commands are invoked based on platform checks, possibly to facilitate further malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains multiple obfuscated functions with meaningless or randomly generated names, encoded strings decoded at runtime for network activity, and conditional execution based on platform (e.g., 'darwin'). It also appears to embed encoded commands that are sent over network connections, potentially as part of a command-and-control setup. Use of try-except blocks to suppress errors during network operations also suggests malicious concealment. The presence of hardcoded hashes and the complex, obscure structure of code raises suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a setup script for a Python package but includes obfuscated and encoded code that decodes payloads and sends data to external servers. The use of base64 decoding, runtime network connection creation, and conditional execution on specific platforms (e.g., macOS) indicates a possible malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or remote control. The presence of hidden payloads, encoded commands, and attempts to obscure code logic points to malicious sabotage or malware delivery. The code also loads package metadata and configuration, but the embedded network activity and decoding routines are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains obfuscated and encoded routines that perform network communication and file reading, likely for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or remote control. The package setup functions are intertwined with potentially harmful behaviors, indicating a supply chain attack or malicious package. Due to the encoded payloads, network activity, and obfuscation, this code is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
