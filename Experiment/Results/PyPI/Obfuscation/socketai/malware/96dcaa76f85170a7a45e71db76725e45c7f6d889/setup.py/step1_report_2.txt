{
  "purpose": "This script is primarily a setup and installation script for a Python package, with some additional obfuscated code potentially related to secure or malicious operations.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hardcoded base64-encoded strings, a list of hash-like strings, and reading from 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests in the nested 'for' loop; subprocess output is obtained but not directly used; possibly dangerous actions include network communication with embedded data.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated data decoded from base64, then used to generate hashes, and used in network requests, potentially sending data to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated functions, base64-encoded strings, and code that constructs network connections and file operations in a manner that obscures intent; no clear documentation or comments explaining purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple obfuscated functions that import modules dynamically, decode base64 strings, and perform network operations. The main suspicious part is in the 'kNrfrSmLeIfCqulkZoQtIABfnMNVVkhD' method, which performs network POST requests with data read from files, encoded in base64. The data transmitted could potentially be sensitive. The code uses dynamic module imports and base64 decoding, which are common obfuscation techniques. There are no hardcoded credentials, but the network communication and obfuscated code suggest a potential for malicious activity. The setup functions are standard, but the nested network request logic is unusual for a benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated functions that perform network communications involving data read from files, which could be used to exfiltrate information. There are no direct indications of malicious backdoors or system damage, but the obfuscation and network activity pose security concerns. Overall, the script shows moderate suspicion due to data handling and obfuscation, but lacks explicit malicious actions.",
