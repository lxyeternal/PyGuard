{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated setup script that decodes base64 strings, establishes network connections, and sends file data during installation, potentially for malicious data exfiltration or remote payload delivery.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded strings decoded into URLs and commands, file reads during network requests, dynamic imports, and platform-specific code execution.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests transmitting file contents and decoded data, network connections with potentially malicious URLs, and system commands executed conditionally.",
  "flows": "Decoding base64 strings -> constructing network connections -> reading files -> sending data over network during setup -> potential exfiltration or payload delivery.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy use of base64 encoding, dynamic imports, obfuscated function names, network activity during package installation, silent exception handling, platform-specific code execution, and data transmitted over network during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code employs multiple obfuscation techniques, including base64 decoding and dynamic imports, to conceal its true purpose. It performs network requests with data read from files, likely for exfiltration. The network activity occurs during installation, which is unusual for benign setup scripts. The functions that handle network connections are called conditionally based on platform, and the code decodes URLs and payloads dynamically. These behaviors, combined with the obfuscation, strongly suggest malicious intent, such as data theft or remote command execution. The code's structure and signals align with typical supply chain attack patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, including potential data exfiltration, remote payload delivery, and obfuscation designed to evade detection. The combination of network activity during setup, obfuscated code, and data handling indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior, warranting caution and further investigation.",
