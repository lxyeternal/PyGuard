  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect their described behaviors. Reports 1 and 4 show signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting moderate suspicion (malware scores around 0.2–0.3 if unconfirmed). Other reports are benign with low scores. Adjustments should be made based on actual code inspection, but current assessments are reasonable given the summaries."
