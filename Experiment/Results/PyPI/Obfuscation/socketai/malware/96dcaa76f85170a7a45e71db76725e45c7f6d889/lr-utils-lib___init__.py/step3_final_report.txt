  "purpose": "Analysis of supply chain security and malicious behavior in Python dependencies, focusing on obfuscation, dynamic execution, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, external files, network calls, system commands, environment variables, command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "System calls (os.system, subprocess), network communication, file writes, environment variables, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec).",
  "flows": "Input sources (user input, environment variables) flow into system/network calls, dynamic execution points, or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec, hardcoded credentials or URLs, suspicious network activity, complex or unusual code structure without comments.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. Suspicious patterns include eval/exec usage, hardcoded secrets, and obfuscated variable names. Some reports overstate suspicion without concrete code evidence; others correctly identify benign patterns. Scores are generally aligned with the described behaviors, but for reports indicating obfuscation and eval/exec, higher malware scores are justified if confirmed. The overall risk is elevated where multiple suspicious indicators are present. Without explicit code snippets, suspicion levels are estimated based on descriptions, with adjustments recommended if actual code confirms or refutes these signs.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect their described behaviors. Reports 1 and 4 show signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting moderate suspicion (malware scores around 0.2–0.3 if unconfirmed). Other reports are benign with low scores. Adjustments should be made based on actual code inspection, but current assessments are reasonable given the summaries.",
