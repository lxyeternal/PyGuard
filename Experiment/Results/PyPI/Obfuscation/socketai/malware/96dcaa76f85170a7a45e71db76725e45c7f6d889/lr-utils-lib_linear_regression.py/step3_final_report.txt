{
  "purpose": "Implements a linear regression analysis class with methods to compute regression parameters, errors, and correlation metrics, using obfuscated class and method names.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters for data input; internal numpy arrays storing data; properties accessing data and computed metrics.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or file operations; no untrusted data outputs or external communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into internal numpy arrays; calculations of regression parameters and metrics are performed internally without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "Superficial obfuscation of class and method names; no malicious code, backdoors, or external data leaks; print statements are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard linear regression calculations, including slope, intercept, errors, and correlation metrics, using numpy and pandas. Obfuscated names suggest an attempt to conceal purpose but do not hide malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The calculations are straightforward and align with typical statistical analysis. Obfuscation is superficial, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of linear regression analysis with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0.8, and risk score of 0.2 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
