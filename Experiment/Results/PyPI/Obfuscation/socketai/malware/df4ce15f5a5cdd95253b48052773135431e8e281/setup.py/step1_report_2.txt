{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with a custom installation process that collects system information and sends it to a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment and system data retrieved via os.popen('uname -a'), os.getcwd(), os.popen('ifconfig'), os.popen('curl ifconfig.me'), os.popen('systeminfo'), os.popen('ipconfig'), os.popen('tasklist'), os.popen('whoami'), os.popen('hostname'), and reading from sys.platform.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data is sent via os.system() executing a curl POST request to a Slack webhook URL with collected system info, potentially leaking system data.",
  "flows": "Sources such as system info commands feed into variables that are formatted into a JSON payload, which is then sent over the network via os.system() to a Slack URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code runs multiple system commands to gather system information, then immediately sends this data to an external URL without any user consent, validation, or encryption. The code also uses obfuscated class and variable names. The 'curl' command is hardcoded in os.system() with a Slack webhook, which indicates possible malicious data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom 'install' command class that, during installation, detects the platform, collects various system and network info, and sends this info to an external Slack webhook URL via a curl POST request embedded in os.system(). The information includes hostname, current directory, user identity, OS details, and IP address. All commands execute with no validation or encryption, and data is sent unencrypted. The presence of obfuscated class and variable names suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent or evade detection. This behavior resembles data exfiltration, which is malicious. The code does not perform any harmful system modifications but actively leaks system information.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and transmitting it to an external server without user consent. It is highly suspicious due to obfuscation and direct data exfiltration. The package should be considered dangerous for supply chain security and should not be used.",
