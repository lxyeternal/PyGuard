{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information during package installation and exfiltrates it to an external Slack webhook, indicating malicious intent to spy or steal data without user consent.",
  "sources": "System commands such as 'uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist', 'whoami', 'hostname', and current working directory.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system()' call executing a 'curl' command to send a JSON payload containing sensitive info to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system commands into variables, then formatted into a JSON string, and finally transmitted via the 'curl' command executed by 'os.system()'.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, silent data collection and exfiltration during installation, hardcoded webhook URL, no user notification or consent, and use of multiple platform-specific commands for info gathering.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during setup, gathers sensitive system info based on platform, constructs a JSON payload, and exfiltrates it via a curl command to an external webhook. The obfuscation and silent operation strongly suggest malicious intent, aiming to spy on the system or steal data covertly. The use of 'os.popen()' for info collection and 'os.system()' for data exfiltration are security concerns. The behavior aligns with malicious supply chain activity, such as data theft or privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, covertly collecting and transmitting sensitive system information during package installation. Its obfuscation and exfiltration behavior justify high malware and security risk scores. It should be considered malicious, and packages containing such code should be flagged or rejected.",
