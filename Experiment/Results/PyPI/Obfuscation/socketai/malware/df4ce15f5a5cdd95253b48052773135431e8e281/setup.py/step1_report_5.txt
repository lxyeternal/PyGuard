  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that collects system information and posts it to a Slack webhook during installation.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls to gather system info, platform checks, and command outputs; reading environment info like hostname, user, public IP, OS details.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call that sends collected data to an external Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data collected via os.popen() from system commands is combined into a JSON payload and sent via os.system() to an external URL, potentially leaking sensitive system info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names; gathering of system info including IP addresses, hostname, user info, and OS details; data exfiltration to external service during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that executes during package installation. It gathers detailed system information based on the OS platform, including hostname, user identity, OS details, and public IP via curl commands. These data points are then sent to a Slack webhook URL via a curl command executed through os.system(). The obfuscated class and variable names, along with the active data exfiltration during installation, suggest malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior related to privacy invasion and possible backdoor functionalities. The code does not perform any explicit malicious actions like damaging files or reverse shells but is designed to silently send system info to an external server, which is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code actively collects sensitive system information and exfiltrates it during package installation, indicating malicious or at least privacy-invasive behavior. The obfuscated naming and data collection/exfiltration pattern are typical of malicious code embedded in a supply chain. It poses a security risk and should be considered malicious.",
