{
  "purpose": "Setup script that installs a Python package and executes system commands during installation, including system information collection and sending data to a remote URL.",
  "sources": "System commands executed via os.popen() (uname, ifconfig, curl, systeminfo, ipconfig, tasklist, whoami, hostname), reading environment and system data, and collecting OS details.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call that posts collected information to an external Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Sources (system commands and environment data) feed into variables which are then formatted into a JSON payload and sent via os.system() to a remote endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual execution of multiple system commands to gather detailed system information, sending data over network to a Slack webhook, use of obfuscated class name and variable names, and execution during package setup which is not typical for benign packages.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the install command. During installation, it collects various system details depending on the platform and constructs a message with hostname, user, public IP, current directory, OS info, and hostname. Instead of benign logging, it sends this data to an external Slack webhook via an os.system() call, revealing potential data exfiltration. The obfuscated class name and variables suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. This behavior is highly suspicious because it gathers sensitive information and transmits it externally without user consent, which constitutes a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and exfiltrating it via a webhook during package installation. This indicates malicious intent, such as spying or data theft. The package should be considered highly dangerous and should not be used.",
