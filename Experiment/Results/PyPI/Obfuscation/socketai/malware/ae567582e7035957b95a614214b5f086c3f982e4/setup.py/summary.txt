  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with an obfuscated package name. No malicious behavior is detected. The primary concern is the obfuscated name, which warrants further investigation in a broader context. The malware score remains 0; obfuscation is high, and overall security risk is low but slightly elevated due to the suspicious naming."
