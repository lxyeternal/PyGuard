  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or nonsensical package name 'dv1nzsoikw39sms4'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static setup script importing setuptools and calling setup() with fixed metadata. The package name appears obfuscated, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. No dynamic code, external data, network activity, or malicious functions are present. The obfuscated name warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent on its own. Malware scores are correctly zero; security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code but acknowledging obfuscation. The code's simplicity and lack of dynamic behavior suggest no malicious activity. The main concern is the obfuscated package name, which could be used to hide malicious intent in a broader context, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with an obfuscated package name. No malicious behavior is detected. The primary concern is the obfuscated name, which warrants further investigation in a broader context. The malware score remains 0; obfuscation is high, and overall security risk is low but slightly elevated due to the suspicious naming.",
