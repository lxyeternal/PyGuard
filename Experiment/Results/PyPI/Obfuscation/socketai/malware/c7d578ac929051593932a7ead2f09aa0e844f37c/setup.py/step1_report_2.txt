  "anomalies": "Unconditional call to send system info without user consent, uses hardcoded URL, potentially exfiltrates system info via HTTP POST to an external server",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules, then defines a function to perform HTTP requests. It then defines a function that gathers system information (username, OS info, hostname) and sends this data to a specified remote URL ('http://us.dslab.pw/webhook.php') via a POST request with JSON payload. This call is made immediately upon script execution, regardless of context. The latter part of the code sets up a Python package with specified metadata, which appears normal. The initial info exfiltration function is suspicious due to lack of user interaction and sending data to a suspicious domain, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script secretly collects system information and exfiltrates it to a remote server without user consent, which is malicious behavior. The rest of the code is standard package setup, but the info leak function is highly suspicious and likely malicious.",
