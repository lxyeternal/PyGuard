{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (user, hostname, platform) and immediately exfiltrates it to a suspicious external URL via an HTTP POST request without user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser(), platform.uname(), socket.gethostname()",
  "sinks": "wWmwlUEZoVVZmDcOpGCengQBFfoRXDro() function sending data via HTTP POST to 'http://us.dslab.pw/webhook.php'",
  "flows": "System info is gathered in ojYGeaSmJjiSgBXlgbDXwGcHVXZbPiDa() and directly sent to the external URL without validation or user notification",
  "anomalies": "Immediate, unprompted data exfiltration upon script import; use of suspicious URL; minimal obfuscation of variable names; transmission over insecure HTTP",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system information and transmits it to a suspicious server as soon as imported, with no user notification. The URL is untrusted, and the transmission occurs over HTTP, indicating covert data exfiltration. Variable names are obfuscated but not heavily, and the setup code appears normal but is used maliciously. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75-0.8, security risk ~0.8-0.85, obfuscation ~0.2) are consistent with this behavior. The behavior is clearly malicious, and the scores reflect high risk and malware likelihood.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through automatic, covert system info exfiltration to a suspicious URL. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified given the severity of the activity. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score should be around 0.85, with obfuscation low (~0.2).",
