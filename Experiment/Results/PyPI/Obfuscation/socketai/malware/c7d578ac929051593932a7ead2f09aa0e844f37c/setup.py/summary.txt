  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through automatic, covert system info exfiltration to a suspicious URL. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified given the severity of the activity. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score should be around 0.85, with obfuscation low (~0.2)."
