  "purpose": "Analyze minimal Python code with obfuscated variables and non-standard modules for potential malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Imports from _advance and _table modules; assignment of 'exploitcat' to an obfuscated variable.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, network activity, or malicious commands are present; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports and variable assignment; no active code execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and module names; presence of string 'exploitcat' which could be a marker but not malicious on its own.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of imports and a variable assignment with obfuscated names. No active malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. The obfuscation and unusual module names are suspicious but not conclusive. The string 'exploitcat' appears as a label but does not indicate malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports generally reflect suspicion but lack concrete malicious activity. Given the evidence, the code appears benign, and the risk is low. The malware score should be set to 0, with obfuscation scores adjusted to reflect suspicion, and overall security risk kept low.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign with no active malicious behavior. Obfuscation is present but not sufficient to classify as malicious. Scores should be conservative, with malware at 0, moderate obfuscation scores, and low security risk. No immediate threat is identified.",
