  "purpose": "Minimal Python module imports with obfuscated variable assignment; no evident malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports from '_advance' and '_table'; variable assignment 'VDnnoyQZlmltfMMIfkQkOefYzmmPCAjj = \"exploitcat\"'.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, network activity, or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; code is static with no source-to-sink data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module names and variable identifiers; use of non-standard modules; string 'exploitcat' possibly suspicious but no active malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of imports and a variable assignment with obfuscated names. No malicious actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code execution are present. The obfuscation and module naming are suspicious but not conclusive. The string 'exploitcat' could be a placeholder or indicator but lacks context. Scores assigned in reports reflect high obfuscation (around 0.7), very low malware risk (near 0), and moderate security risk (around 0.2). Overall, the code appears benign but warrants monitoring due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The snippets do not demonstrate malicious behavior; obfuscation and module naming are suspicious but not definitive. Malware risk is effectively zero; obfuscation is high, and overall security risk is low. No immediate threat detected, but further review if additional context emerges.",
