  "purpose": "Detects and analyzes suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess call executing encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers subprocess execution of obfuscated PowerShell command; silent error handling conceals failures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded (Base64) PowerShell command, hidden window execution, silent exception handling, conditional trigger based on filesystem.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a filesystem check; if absent, it runs a hidden, encoded PowerShell command, likely obfuscated to conceal malicious intent. Exception handling is broad and silent, further hiding errors. The setup() call appears benign. The obfuscated command and stealthy execution pattern are characteristic of malicious payloads. Scores assigned by reports (malware ~0.8, obfuscated ~0.9, risk ~0.85) are justified given these indicators, though decoding the command would confirm maliciousness. The activity aligns with typical supply chain sabotage or malware deployment tactics.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution during setup. The scores are consistent with this assessment. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious payloads. Until then, treat this package as high risk.",
