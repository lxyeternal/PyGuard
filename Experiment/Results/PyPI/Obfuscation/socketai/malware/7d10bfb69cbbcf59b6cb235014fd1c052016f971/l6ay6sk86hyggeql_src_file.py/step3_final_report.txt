{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate sensitive wallet and configuration files related to Exodus, along with system information, via Telegram. It packages targeted files into a ZIP archive and sends it to an attacker-controlled bot, indicating malicious intent for theft and covert data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), file existence checks for specific wallet and config files, and network requests to obtain IP and geolocation information.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows include the POST requests to Telegram API endpoints, sending messages and documents, which transmit exfiltrated data to attacker-controlled servers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file existence checks and environment variables, through packaging into ZIP, then via network POST requests to Telegram, with geolocation info appended to messages, and finally deletion of local files.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, use of obfuscated variable names, emoji encoding of country codes, and the use of an undefined variable 'username' which would cause runtime errors. The code also attempts to access non-existent methods like os.DPgJHFmtOfeKbDuFZGZiDttSKrIVTBBC.exists().",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by targeting sensitive user files, packaging them, and exfiltrating via Telegram. It employs obfuscation techniques such as emoji encoding and variable name obfuscation. The hardcoded secrets and network activity confirm malicious intent. The undefined 'username' variable indicates incomplete or obfuscated code, which would cause runtime errors but does not negate the malicious purpose. The use of hardcoded tokens and chat IDs further supports the malicious profile. The flow from file checks to network exfiltration is consistent with malware behavior. Despite some technical flaws, the overall intent and actions are clearly malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for wallet theft and data exfiltration, with moderate obfuscation. It uses hardcoded secrets and network communication to transmit sensitive data to an attacker. The high malware and risk scores are justified. The main technical flaw is the undefined 'username' variable and incorrect method calls, but these do not diminish the malicious intent. Overall, the code represents a high-severity threat with clear malicious behavior.",
