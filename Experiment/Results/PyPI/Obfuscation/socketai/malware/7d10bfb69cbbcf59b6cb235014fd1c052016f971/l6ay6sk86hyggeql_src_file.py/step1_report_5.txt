{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect and package sensitive user data, specifically from the 'exodus' directory and configuration files, into a ZIP archive, then send this archive via Telegram, potentially for unauthorized data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables ('LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA', 'TEMP'), user input via getpass.getuser(), and files in specific directories related to 'exodus' wallet information and configuration files.",
  "sinks": "The ZIP file created in the user's AppData directory and the subsequent POST requests to Telegram's API endpoints for sending messages and documents. The code also attempts to delete the ZIP file after transmission.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from local environment variables and specific user files, written into a ZIP archive, then the ZIP file is read and sent over the network to Telegram's servers via HTTP POST requests. There is also a request to get the public IP and country code, which are appended to the message payload.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; use of obfuscated string variables; collection of specific wallet and configuration files known to contain sensitive data; sending of user data over the internet without consent; manipulation of environment variables and user directories; attempt to delete files after exfiltration; potential privacy invasion; use of environment variables and directory paths without validation; code structure suggests stealth and data harvesting intent.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by importing modules and defining a function that gathers the current username, environment variables, and hardcoded credentials. It constructs file paths pointing to sensitive wallet and configuration files related to 'exodus'. It checks for the existence of these files and, if found, packages them into a ZIP archive. The code optionally collects IP and country info and embeds it into a message with a flag, then sends the ZIP file and message to a Telegram bot using hardcoded token and chat ID. After sending, it attempts to delete the ZIP file. The purpose appears to be the clandestine collection and transmission of user wallet data, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a data stealer targeting specific wallet and configuration files, exfiltrating them via Telegram. The presence of hardcoded credentials, sensitive file access, and network exfiltration strongly suggests malicious behavior. It is designed to operate stealthily, capturing sensitive data and sending it to an external server.",
