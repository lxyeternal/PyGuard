{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect and exfiltrate sensitive user data, including wallet and configuration files related to Exodus, and potentially sends this data via Telegram.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA', 'TEMP'), reads specific files from user directories (e.g., wallet info, configuration files), and makes network requests to IP geolocation services and Telegram API.",
  "sinks": "Writes collected files into a ZIP archive, sends this archive over the network to Telegram using bot API, and performs HTTP requests to external IP/geolocation services.",
  "flows": "Data from wallet/config files (sources) are aggregated into a ZIP archive. If certain files are found, the code also appends geolocation info to a message, then exfiltrates the archive via Telegram API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, obfuscated variable names, and dynamically constructs messages with geolocation info. The code scans user directories for wallet-related files, packages them, and transmits them remotely. There is also an attempt to delete the ZIP file after sending, which indicates an effort to hide artifacts.",
  "analysis": "The script collects user-specific wallet and configuration files from the user's directories, packages them into a ZIP archive, and sends the archive via Telegram, indicating potential data theft. It also collects geolocation info and encodes country code into emojis, then includes this info in the message. The use of hardcoded tokens, the dynamic filename handling, and the targeted collection of sensitive files strongly suggest malicious intent. The network communications and cleanup actions support a covert exfiltration pattern. The code appears intentionally designed to harvest sensitive user data and transmit it without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, performing data exfiltration of wallet and configuration files, using hardcoded credentials and covert communication channels to send stolen data to an attacker-controlled Telegram bot. It exhibits typical traits of malware designed for credential theft and privacy invasion.",
