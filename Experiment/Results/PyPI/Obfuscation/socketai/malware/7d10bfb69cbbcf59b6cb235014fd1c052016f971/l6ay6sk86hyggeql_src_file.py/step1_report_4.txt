{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect user and system information, sensitive files, and potentially wallet data, then compresses these files into a ZIP archive and uploads it to a remote server, possibly for malicious purposes such as data theft or privacy invasion.",
  "sources": "User environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), user input (getpass.getuser()), file existence checks, reading sensitive wallet and configuration files, network requests (IP address and country), and local file paths for exodus wallet data.",
  "sinks": "Writing files into ZIP archive, HTTP POST requests to Telegram API with bot token and chat ID, sending the ZIP file as a document via Telegram, and deleting local ZIP files after upload.",
  "flows": "System and user data are collected from environment variables and files, then stored in a ZIP archive; the archive is uploaded over the network via Telegram API endpoints, potentially leaking sensitive information to the attacker.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, extensive access to wallet and configuration files without user consent, obfuscated variable names, conditional execution based on existence of specific files, and network communication sending sensitive data. The code also constructs and executes network requests and file operations without transparency or user notification.",
  "analysis": "The script collects user information, wallet data, and system files from specific directories, then creates a ZIP archive containing these sensitive files. It uses hardcoded credentials for Telegram bot API, and upon certain conditions, sends the archive to an attacker-controlled Telegram chat. The code exhibits obfuscated variable names, making analysis more difficult but not indicating malicious obfuscation beyond simple variable naming. The collection of sensitive files, coupled with network exfiltration of data, strongly suggests malicious intent. Additionally, the code accesses environment variables, files, and performs network operations typical of data theft malware. There is no legitimate purpose indicated for this behavior, and the presence of hardcoded tokens and systematic collection of wallet files indicate intent to steal sensitive information.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious, as it performs extensive collection of sensitive user data and wallet files, compresses and transmits them to an external server via Telegram API, and deletes local copies afterward. The presence of hardcoded credentials and the nature of file access point to malicious data exfiltration activity. Overall, this code qualifies as malware with a high security risk.",
