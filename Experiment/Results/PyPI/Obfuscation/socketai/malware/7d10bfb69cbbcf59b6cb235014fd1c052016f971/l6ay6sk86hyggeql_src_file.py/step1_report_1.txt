{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect and exfiltrate user data, including configuration files, wallet information, and potentially sensitive files from specific directories, then compresses and sends them via a Telegram bot. It also gathers IP and country info for reporting.",
  "sources": "User environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), specific file paths in user directories (exodus wallet files, config, seed, passphrase), and network requests for IP information.",
  "sinks": "Writing files into a ZIP archive, sending data over network via Telegram bot API, including sending documents and messages, and reading sensitive files like wallet configs and seed files.",
  "flows": "From environment variables and specific file paths (sources) to ZIP archive creation and population, then to data exfiltration through Telegram API calls (sinks), with optional geolocation data added based on IP information.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, collection of multiple sensitive wallet files, IP-based geolocation info appended to message, use of obfuscated string manipulation for the country code, and uploading potentially sensitive data without user consent. Also, inconsistent use of 'username' variable which is undefined, indicating code likely incomplete or obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by retrieving the current username, then defines multiple paths to collect sensitive wallet and config files from user directories related to Exodus wallet. It constructs a ZIP archive and attempts to include these files. If any wallet files are detected, it sets a flag to exfiltrate data. It also collects system IP and country info, encodes the country code using a Unicode offset, and appends this info to a message. The message and the ZIP file are sent via a Telegram bot, with the token and chat ID hardcoded. The code has several suspicious features, including hardcoded credentials, collection of sensitive user files, data exfiltration without user consent, and obfuscated code. The code potentially acts as malware designed for theft of wallet data and system info, with communication channels established for remote access.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious intent, primarily targeting user wallet files and personal system data for exfiltration via Telegram. It contains hardcoded secrets, accesses sensitive files, and reports system info without user consent. The structure and actions indicate malware behavior aimed at theft and remote control. Overall, this is a high-risk, malicious script.",
