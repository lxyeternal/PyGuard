{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect various user and system data, including wallet files and configuration files, and exfiltrate this data via a Telegram bot.",
  "sources": "User input (getpass.getuser()), environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), and local file system (wallet and config files).",
  "sinks": "Writing files into a zip archive, uploading the archive via Telegram API (sendDocument), and sending messages with system info and IP address.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from user environment and system files, then compressed into a zip file, then transmitted through Telegram API calls.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded Telegram bot token, constructs file paths with a 'username' variable (which is undefined), and exfiltrates sensitive wallet files and configuration data without user consent. Also, it encodes country code characters into Unicode emojis for IP info, suggesting obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the current username, constructs paths to potentially sensitive wallet and configuration files within the user's roaming appdata directories. It checks for existence of certain files and packages them into a zip archive if found. The code then gathers system info such as IP address and country code, encoding the country code into emojis. It then sends the zip archive and a message containing system info to a Telegram bot, using a hardcoded token. The presence of wallet files and the data exfiltration via a Telegram bot indicate malicious intent, specifically data theft of wallet information. The code also uses an undefined 'username' variable, which might cause runtime errors, but this does not mitigate its malicious design. Overall, the script functions as a wallet stealer and exfiltrator, with obfuscation elements like emoji encoding and hardcoded tokens.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to exfiltrate wallet and system data via Telegram, indicating a wallet stealer Trojan. It contains obfuscation techniques and hardcoded secrets, confirming malicious intent.",
