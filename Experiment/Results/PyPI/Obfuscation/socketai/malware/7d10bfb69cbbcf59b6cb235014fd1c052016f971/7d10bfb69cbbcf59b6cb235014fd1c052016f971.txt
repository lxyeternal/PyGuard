      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and potential malicious intent primarily due to the nonsensical function name and import pattern. While no concrete malicious activity is confirmed from this snippet alone, the suspicion is high enough to warrant further analysis of 'src_file' and the function's implementation. The scores are consistent with the suspicion level, with malware risk estimated around 0.65, obfuscation at 0.8, and overall security risk at 0.7."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for wallet theft and data exfiltration, with moderate obfuscation. It uses hardcoded secrets and network communication to transmit sensitive data to an attacker. The high malware and risk scores are justified. The main technical flaw is the undefined 'username' variable and incorrect method calls, but these do not diminish the malicious intent. Overall, the code represents a high-severity threat with clear malicious behavior."
