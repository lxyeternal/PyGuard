  "security_risk": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and potential malicious intent primarily due to the nonsensical function name and import pattern. While no concrete malicious activity is confirmed from this snippet alone, the suspicion is high enough to warrant further analysis of 'src_file' and the function's implementation. The scores are consistent with the suspicion level, with malware risk estimated around 0.65, obfuscation at 0.8, and overall security risk at 0.7."
