      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and performs system-level operations that strongly suggest malicious intent, such as covert system modifications, privilege escalation, and potential backdoor setup. It should be treated as malicious, and execution avoided. The high scores assigned are justified based on the analysis."

      "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign or incomplete, with low security risk. Reports 2 and 5 display significant obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying higher malware and risk scores. Minor score adjustments improve consistency with observed features. Further dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious snippets."
