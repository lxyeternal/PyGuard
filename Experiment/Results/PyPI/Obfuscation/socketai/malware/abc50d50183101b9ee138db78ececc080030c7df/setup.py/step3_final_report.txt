{
  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata and dependencies for a Python project using setuptools. It appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() call, including package name, variables, and dependency lists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or dynamic code execution points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is declarative configuration without runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated package name ('ok48kd68hd140to4') and variable names ('pXNQPeStmTflDSjpiXlduUFOSSDMfPdP', 'PdyQFszeOCcBDfTECRLBEmrlYkVxwNmO') suggest intentional obfuscation or nonsensical naming.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package, listing metadata and dependencies. No active malicious code, network activity, or dynamic behaviors are present. The obfuscated naming is suspicious but not indicative of malicious intent on its own. The dependencies are common libraries that could be misused if malicious code exists elsewhere, but their presence alone is not suspicious. The high obfuscation scores across reports reflect suspicion but are justified given the naming. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of active malicious code. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants caution due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard configuration with obfuscated identifiers, which raises suspicion but shows no evidence of malicious behavior. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate, though the obfuscation warrants further review of the full package contents before deployment.",
