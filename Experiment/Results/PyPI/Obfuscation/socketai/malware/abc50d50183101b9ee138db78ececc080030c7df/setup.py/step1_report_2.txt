  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration including metadata and dependencies for a Python package.",
  "sources": "N/A (setup script reads no external untrusted data; dependencies are listed statically).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no code execution, data leaks, or external data usage).",
  "flows": "N/A (static configuration; no runtime data flow).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual package name 'ok48kd68hd140to4' which appears non-descriptive; some variable names like 'pXNQPeStmTflDSjpiXlduUFOSSDMfPdP' and 'PdyQFszeOCcBDfTECRLBEmrlYkVxwNmO' are non-standard and seem obfuscated or randomized. No apparent malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It specifies package metadata, license, keywords, classifiers, and dependencies. The package name and some variable names are non-descriptive, possibly obfuscated or auto-generated, but this alone does not imply malicious intent. There are no code execution, data collection, or network communication actions in this code. Dependencies listed are common Python packages; no suspicious or unusual dependencies are present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a typical package configuration with obfuscated variable names that do not indicate malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware, data leaks, or malicious intent. The package seems safe based on this code fragment.",
