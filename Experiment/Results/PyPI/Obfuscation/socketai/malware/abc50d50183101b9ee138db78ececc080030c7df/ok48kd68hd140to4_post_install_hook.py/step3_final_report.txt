  "purpose": "This code sends a notification message to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL upon package installation, indicating the project name.",
  "sources": "The 'setup.project_name' attribute and the hardcoded webhook URL within the function.",
  "sinks": "The network request via urllib.request to the Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "The 'setup.project_name' is embedded into the JSON payload and transmitted over the network to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded webhook URL, absence of input validation or sanitization, no error handling for network failures, and the webhook URL is embedded directly in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing a simple network request to notify about package installation. It does not contain malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or system modification. The primary security concern is the hardcoded webhook URL and lack of input validation, which could lead to privacy issues or misuse if the code is altered. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is moderate (~0.3), reflecting potential privacy and misuse concerns but not active malicious behavior. The confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.8).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in its current form but exhibits poor security practices due to hardcoded URLs and lack of validation. It does not perform malicious actions but could be exploited for spam or privacy violations if misused. The scores are appropriate: malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk approximately 0.3.",
