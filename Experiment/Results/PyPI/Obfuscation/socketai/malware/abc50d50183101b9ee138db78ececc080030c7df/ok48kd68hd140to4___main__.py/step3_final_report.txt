{
  "purpose": "The code is heavily obfuscated, involving multiple layers of decoding (hex, base64, binary), dynamic string manipulations, and multiple eval() calls. It ultimately decodes payloads and executes them dynamically, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Encoded strings, environment variables, and functions that decode and process data before executing via eval()",
  "sinks": "eval() calls with decoded strings, dynamic code execution points, environment variable reads",
  "flows": "Decoding layers → reconstructed code snippets → eval() execution",
  "anomalies": "Multiple decoding layers, use of eval() on decoded data, convoluted variable names, heavy obfuscation, environment variable access for payloads",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated with multiple decoding steps (hex, base64, binary), uses eval() on dynamically decoded strings, and reads from environment variables. The structure and techniques are consistent with malware designed to hide malicious payloads and execute arbitrary code. The heavy obfuscation, multiple decoding layers, and eval() usage are classic indicators of malicious intent. The analysis across reports confirms these behaviors, with high confidence scores. The scores assigned (malware: 0.9, obfuscated: 0.9, risk: 0.9) are appropriate given the evidence. The only adjustment is to raise the malware score in report 2 from 0.75 to 1, aligning with the others. Overall, the code should be considered malicious and highly dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a highly suspicious, heavily obfuscated malicious payload designed to decode and execute arbitrary code. The analysis and scores are consistent with this assessment, indicating a high probability of malicious behavior and significant security risk.",
