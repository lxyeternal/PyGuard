  "purpose": "Send a notification to a Discord webhook when a package is installed successfully.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' parameter, specifically 'setup.project_name'; the URL and network request via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "sinks": "Network request to Discord webhook URL; printing to stderr; potential sys.exit(1).",
  "flows": "The 'setup.project_name' is used only in the message content; network request sends data to Discord webhook URL; response status is checked to determine success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL embedded directly in code; no user input or dynamic URL generation. No apparent malicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that posts a message to a fixed Discord webhook URL indicating a package has been installed. The URL is hardcoded, which is a security concern if the URL is sensitive, but it does not perform malicious actions itself. The network request sends a JSON payload containing the package name. There are no obfuscated elements, suspicious API calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code’s behavior appears straightforward and intended for notification purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to notify via Discord when a package installs successfully. It uses a hardcoded webhook URL and sends a simple message, which is not inherently malicious. No malware or malicious behavior detected. The main concern is hardcoded URL exposure, but this does not constitute malware or a security risk. Overall, the code seems benign and purposeful.",
