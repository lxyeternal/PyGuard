  "purpose": "The code defines a function that sends a notification message to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, indicating a package has been installed successfully.",
  "sources": "The function reads 'setup.project_name' to include in the message payload.",
  "sinks": "The network request to the Discord webhook URL, transmitting JSON data containing 'setup.project_name'.",
  "flows": "Source: 'setup.project_name' used in JSON payload -> Sink: HTTP POST request to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL; no input validation or sanitization; bug in error message referencing undefined variable; lack of exception handling for network errors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward network request to a fixed URL, sending a JSON message with the project name. It checks for a 204 response to confirm success, otherwise prints an error and exits. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which could be exploited for misuse. No malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. The code is clear but contains a bug in error handling where 'response.status' is referenced but the variable 'VoZLHqUhdWgEGxcxDRGgsMcgcnpffdpx' should be used. The overall behavior is benign, with the main concern being the potential misuse of the hardcoded URL. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward. The security risk score is moderate (around 0.3-0.4), primarily due to the hardcoded URL that could be exploited if embedded maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in its current form but poses a moderate security concern because of the hardcoded webhook URL, which could be exploited for spam or covert monitoring if embedded in malicious packages. No malware or obfuscation is present. The scores should reflect no malware (0), no obfuscation (0), and a moderate security risk (~0.3-0.4).",
