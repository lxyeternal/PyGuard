  "conclusion": "The code is benign in its current form but poses a moderate security concern because of the hardcoded webhook URL, which could be exploited for spam or covert monitoring if embedded in malicious packages. No malware or obfuscation is present. The scores should reflect no malware (0), no obfuscation (0), and a moderate security risk (~0.3-0.4)."
