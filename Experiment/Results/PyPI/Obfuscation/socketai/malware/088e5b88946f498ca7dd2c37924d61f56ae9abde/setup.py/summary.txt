  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to its obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell command during package setup. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and error suppression are typical of malware tactics. While definitive payload analysis is needed for confirmation, the current evidence warrants a high risk and malware score. Caution is advised, and further decoding of the payload is recommended."
