{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, reading a README file and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; static data within setuptools.setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or data flows; no dynamic code execution or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a non-standard key 'CwfDrroQzlkEbnkAZeMLPmDFOQTqHAmT' with a dictionary value, which is not a recognized parameter for setuptools.setup().",
  "analysis": "The code is largely standard for a Python package setup. The suspicious key is not a recognized setup parameter and does not execute code or perform malicious actions. Multiple reports identify this key as anomalous; some assign low malware scores (0 to 0.2), considering it potentially obfuscation or misconfiguration. No evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The key's presence alone does not indicate malicious intent but warrants caution. The scores across reports are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with an anomalous, non-standard key that could be a placeholder or obfuscation but does not exhibit active malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscated at around 0.2, and overall risk at approximately 0.2, reflecting the anomaly without evidence of malicious activity.",
