      "conclusion": "The code is benign with an anomalous, non-standard key that could be a placeholder or obfuscation but does not exhibit active malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscated at around 0.2, and overall risk at approximately 0.2, reflecting the anomaly without evidence of malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to covert exfiltration of sensitive Kubernetes tokens and environment data to an external server under suspicious headers. It should be flagged for further review and considered high risk, with scores reflecting the potential for data theft and reconnaissance."
