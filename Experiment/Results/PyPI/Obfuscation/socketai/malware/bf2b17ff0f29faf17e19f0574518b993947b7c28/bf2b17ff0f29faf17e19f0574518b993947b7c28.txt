      "conclusion": "The setup script contains obfuscated parameters that are suspicious but do not demonstrate active malicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate; malware is unlikely, but obfuscation warrants further review. Overall, the package appears benign but should be examined further to confirm the purpose of the obfuscated key."

      "conclusion": "The code is a malicious backdoor acting as a command-and-control client, enabling remote command execution, data exfiltration, and persistent control. It employs insecure SSL, minimal obfuscation, and unvalidated command execution, making it highly dangerous and consistent with malware behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, acting as a remote command-and-control client with capabilities for executing arbitrary commands, exfiltrating data, and evading detection through obfuscation and SSL bypass. The observed behaviors justify maximum malware and security risk scores. It should be flagged as malware and removed from any environment where it is present."
