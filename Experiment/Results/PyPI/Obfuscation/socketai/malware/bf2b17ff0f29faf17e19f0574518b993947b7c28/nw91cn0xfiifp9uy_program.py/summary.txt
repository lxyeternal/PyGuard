  "conclusion": "The code is a malicious backdoor acting as a command-and-control client, enabling remote command execution, data exfiltration, and persistent control. It employs insecure SSL, minimal obfuscation, and unvalidated command execution, making it highly dangerous and consistent with malware behavior."
