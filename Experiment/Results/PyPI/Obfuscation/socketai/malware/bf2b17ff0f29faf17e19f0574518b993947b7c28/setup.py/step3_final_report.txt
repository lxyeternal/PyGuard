  "purpose": "Standard package setup script with an unusual, obfuscated parameter key.",
  "sources": "The setup() call parameters, especially the key 'spIMvgbJuffuYWbsdSfozDpwVQxUypLp=' and 'long_description' string.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic or external data sources; potential concern is the obfuscated parameter possibly hiding malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "The obfuscated key and encoded string are static; no data flow from untrusted sources is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a nonsensical or obfuscated parameter key 'spIMvgbJuffuYWbsdSfozDpwVQxUypLp=' and an encoded string in 'long_description'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with static metadata. The suspicious parameter key does not match standard 'setuptools' parameters, indicating obfuscation or placeholder usage. No active malicious code, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present. The obfuscated key and encoded string warrant further investigation but do not confirm malicious intent. Malware scores are appropriately low (0-0.2), reflecting no active malicious behavior. Obfuscation scores are high (around 0.6-0.8), consistent with the suspicious parameter. Risk scores are low (0.2-0.3), aligning with the absence of active threats but noting the obfuscation concern.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains obfuscated parameters that are suspicious but do not demonstrate active malicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate; malware is unlikely, but obfuscation warrants further review. Overall, the package appears benign but should be examined further to confirm the purpose of the obfuscated key.",
