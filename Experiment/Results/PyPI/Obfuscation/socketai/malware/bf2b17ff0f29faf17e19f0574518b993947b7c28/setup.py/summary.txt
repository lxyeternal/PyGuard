  "conclusion": "The setup script contains obfuscated parameters that are suspicious but do not demonstrate active malicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate; malware is unlikely, but obfuscation warrants further review. Overall, the package appears benign but should be examined further to confirm the purpose of the obfuscated key."
