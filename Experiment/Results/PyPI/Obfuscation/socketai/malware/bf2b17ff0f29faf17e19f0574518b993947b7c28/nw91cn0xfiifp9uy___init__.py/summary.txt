  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, acting as a remote command-and-control client with capabilities for executing arbitrary commands, exfiltrating data, and evading detection through obfuscation and SSL bypass. The observed behaviors justify maximum malware and security risk scores. It should be flagged as malware and removed from any environment where it is present."
