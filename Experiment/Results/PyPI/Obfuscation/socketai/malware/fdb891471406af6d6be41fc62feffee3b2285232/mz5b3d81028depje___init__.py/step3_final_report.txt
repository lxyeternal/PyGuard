  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, dynamic execution points, network communication, hardcoded secrets, environment variables, data handling functions.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, environment variable access, data exfiltration points, system commands execution.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into code execution, network transmission, or data storage sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code (high suspicion), dynamic code execution, suspicious network communication, hardcoded credentials, unusual imports or functions.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 indicates obfuscation and signs of dynamic execution, with moderate suspicion of malicious intent; scores reflect suspicion but lack concrete evidence. Reports 2-5 show no suspicious activity, with scores appropriately low. The malware score for Report 1 is slightly high given the suspicion; adjusting it downward from 0.4 to 0.3 improves accuracy. Obfuscation score in Report 1 remains justified at 0.7 due to suspicion. Overall, scores are consistent with the evidence presented, with cautious interpretation where evidence is lacking.",
  "conclusion": "The code in Report 1 shows signs of obfuscation and potential malicious behavior but lacks definitive evidence; a malware score of 0.3 is more appropriate. Other reports are benign, with scores reflecting their lack of suspicious features. Overall, the assessments are reasonable and aligned with the available information.",
