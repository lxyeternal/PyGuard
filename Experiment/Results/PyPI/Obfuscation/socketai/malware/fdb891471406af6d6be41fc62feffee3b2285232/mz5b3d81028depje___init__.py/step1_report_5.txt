{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a Python package module, likely intended for general functionality within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, imports standard and third-party libraries, possibly reads files or network data if present in unseen parts of the code.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files, network sockets, or logs; may execute code dynamically or use subprocesses if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input sources through functions or methods, potentially leading to output or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs identified; no obfuscated code or unusual language features observed; code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common libraries and handles data in a typical manner. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system manipulation. The absence of dynamic code execution, obfuscated strings, or suspicious API calls indicates a low likelihood of malicious intent. Given the limited code context provided, it appears to be a benign package module. However, without seeing actual data flows, files, or network interactions, absolute certainty is limited.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems standard and clean, with no signs of malware or supply chain sabotage.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
