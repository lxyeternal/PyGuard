  "malware_score": 0.3,
  "security_risk": 0.45,

  "conclusion": "The code in Report 1 shows signs of obfuscation and potential malicious behavior but lacks definitive evidence; a malware score of 0.3 is more appropriate. Other reports are benign, with scores reflecting their lack of suspicious features. Overall, the assessments are reasonable and aligned with the available information."
