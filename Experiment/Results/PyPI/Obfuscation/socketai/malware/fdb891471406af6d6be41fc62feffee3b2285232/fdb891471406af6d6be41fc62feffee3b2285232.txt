      "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious, heavily obfuscated, and performs system-level modifications indicative of malicious malware. It is designed to evade detection and could compromise system integrity, escalate privileges, or install harmful packages. The high obfuscation and system interaction strongly suggest malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code in Report 1 shows signs of obfuscation and potential malicious behavior but lacks definitive evidence; a malware score of 0.3 is more appropriate. Other reports are benign, with scores reflecting their lack of suspicious features. Overall, the assessments are reasonable and aligned with the available information."
