{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that prints 'installed' and immediately calls it.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code reads no input or data beyond the function call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Function definition (source) directly leads to its invocation (sink) with no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; minimal code with no meaningful logic; only a print statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is trivial, performing a benign print operation within an obfuscated function. No external data, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation of the function name is suspicious but not malicious. The malware score should be 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7) due to the obfuscated name, which is justified. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal threat in this isolated snippet. The confidence in these conclusions is high (around 0.9), given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscation as the only suspicious aspect. There is no malicious activity detected, and the scores should reflect a safe but obfuscated code snippet.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
