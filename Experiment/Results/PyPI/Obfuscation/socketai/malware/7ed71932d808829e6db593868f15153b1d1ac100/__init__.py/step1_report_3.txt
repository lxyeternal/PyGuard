{
  "purpose": "Defines a function that prints 'installed' and then calls it.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are used in the code.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to the console via print(). No sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Function call leads to printing; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The function and variable names are obfuscated, which may be suspicious. No malicious behavior or hidden code is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a seemingly random name and calls it immediately, which could be an attempt at obfuscation. The function only prints a static message. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious data handling. The obfuscated naming could be suspicious, but it does not directly indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple obfuscated print statement with no malicious behavior. The obfuscated naming might be intended to hide purpose, but functionality is benign.",
