{
  "purpose": "To analyze the provided malicious Python code that performs external network requests, downloads, and executes a payload during package installation, indicating malicious intent and supply chain attack behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; requests to suspicious URLs; downloads executable; executes external payload via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded executable; network requests to exfiltrate data; silent exception handling concealing errors.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variable and network requests -> Sink: execution of external payload and data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and class names; broad silent exception handling; external URLs from suspicious domains; executing downloaded binary during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment data, contacts suspicious URLs, downloads an executable, and runs it silently during installation, indicating malicious activity. Obfuscation and error suppression conceal intent. The behavior aligns with malware delivery and data exfiltration tactics. The code's actions pose a high security risk, warranting maximum concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing remote payload download and execution, with obfuscation and data exfiltration. It represents a severe supply chain security threat and should be flagged as malware.",
