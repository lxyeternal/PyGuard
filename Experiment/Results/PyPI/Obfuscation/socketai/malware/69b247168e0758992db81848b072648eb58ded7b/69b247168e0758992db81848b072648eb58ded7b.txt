      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high suspicion of malicious behavior due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, with concealment tactics and silent error handling. The scores are appropriate, and the overall security risk is high. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm payload intent."
