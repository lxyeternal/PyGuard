  "flows": "if 'tahg' does not exist -> execute encoded PowerShell command via subprocess",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command in subprocess without clear purpose, executing potentially hidden code",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing 'setup' from distutils and attempts to import 'subprocess' and 'os'. It then checks for the existence of a file/directory named 'tahg'. If not found, it executes a subprocess with a PowerShell command encoded in base64. This command appears to be encoded maliciously, likely to perform background or stealthy actions. The setup function defines package metadata but is standard. The presence of an encoded command that runs PowerShell suggests potential malicious activity. The code catches exceptions silently, which can mask issues but also prevents immediate detection of errors. Overall, the embedded PowerShell command is suspicious and likely malicious, especially since it is encoded and runs hidden.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a suspicious encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess when a specific file is absent. This behavior indicates malicious intent, likely to perform hidden or unauthorized actions on the system. The setup code itself appears standard but is overshadowed by the embedded malicious command.",
