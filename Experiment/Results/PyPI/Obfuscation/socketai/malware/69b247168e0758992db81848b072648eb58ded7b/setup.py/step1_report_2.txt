{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package, but it includes hidden malicious activity that executes a PowerShell command if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem to check for 'tahg' directory; it attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen acts as a sink, potentially running malicious encoded commands with hidden window flags.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code triggers the PowerShell encoded command to run in the background, which could lead to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated PowerShell command, conditional execution based on filesystem check, silent subprocess execution with hidden window, absence of explanation for the encoded command.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a filesystem check for a directory named 'tahg'. If missing, it executes a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, hidden from user view. The setup function call appears normal but is enclosed within a try-except block that silently ignores errors, possibly to hide failures. The PowerShell command itself is encoded, making analysis difficult, but its presence indicates potential malicious intent, such as downloading or executing further payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The code's structure, with the obfuscated command and silent execution, suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activity while masquerading as a legitimate setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by executing an obfuscated PowerShell command when a specific directory is absent, which could be used for malicious purposes such as downloading payloads or establishing backdoors. The overall setup appears legitimate at first glance but is compromised by hidden malicious activity.",
