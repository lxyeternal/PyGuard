{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package with metadata and potentially execute hidden PowerShell commands during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; however, it executes a subprocess with an encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess runs a PowerShell command that is Base64-encoded, which could be malicious if the decoded content is harmful.",
  "flows": "The code initiates the subprocess with the encoded command without validation, potentially executing malicious payloads silently.",
  "anomalies": "The encoded PowerShell command suggests obfuscation; no validation or decoding is visible, raising suspicion. The use of Popen with creation flags and hidden window indicates concealment. The try-except blocks suppress errors silently.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to run a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique for obfuscation. The command appears to be a PowerShell script encoded as a string, which could contain malicious code. The setup call is straightforward, but the embedded subprocess execution is suspicious due to obfuscation and concealment tactics. The silent error handling may hide failures or malicious activity. No external input is used, but the code's intent seems to be to execute hidden code during installation, which is typical in supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a potentially malicious obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, indicating malicious intent or malicious compromise. The overall risk score is high due to obfuscation and concealment tactics.",
