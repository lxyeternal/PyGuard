  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious, potentially malicious behavior through obfuscated, silent PowerShell execution during package setup. While the actual payload is unknown, the pattern aligns with malware tactics. Scores of approximately 0.85 for malware and 0.9 for security risk are justified. The package should be treated as high risk pending further payload analysis."
