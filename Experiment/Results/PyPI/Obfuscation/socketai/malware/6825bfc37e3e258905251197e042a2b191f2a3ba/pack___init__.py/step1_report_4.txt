  "sources": "Input is likely obtained from function parameters, environment variables, or external libraries, but no explicit input sources are evident from the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file operations, or data output functions, but no direct sink is explicitly shown in the code fragment.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves reading input from sources, processing it through various functions or operations, and possibly outputting or transmitting the data.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code constructs detected in the provided code segment. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
