{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a basic utility or script that performs specific functions, potentially related to data processing or system interaction.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, user inputs via input() functions, and possibly reads files or network responses if present.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could reach file system operations, network requests, or system commands, if such functions are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or user inputs through various functions, potentially reaching sinks like system calls or network communication points.",
  "anomalies": "There are no immediately obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions. No unusual dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors are detected. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and procedural, utilizing standard Python libraries and functions. No evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. All inputs and outputs follow normal patterns. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are identified. The overall complexity and clarity suggest benign behavior, but without full context or hidden code, absolute certainty isn't guaranteed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and standard. Confidence is high that this code does not contain malware or obfuscation, and it poses minimal security risk.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
