  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "eval/exec statements, hardcoded strings, complex control flow, environment variable access, input/output functions",
  "sinks": "Potential code execution points, data exfiltration via network or environment variables, file modifications",
  "flows": "Source: eval/exec or input functions; Sink: system calls, network connections, environment variable access",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (variable names, code complexity), dynamic code execution, suspicious hardcoded strings",
  "analysis": "The code contains eval/exec and obfuscated variable names, indicating high obfuscation and malicious potential. The presence of suspicious strings and complex control flow supports high malware and security risk scores. Other reports describe straightforward, benign code with no suspicious features, aligning with low scores. The overall assessment emphasizes that only Report 1 shows significant malicious indicators, justified by the high malware (0.75), obfuscated (0.9), and security risk (0.8) scores. The remaining reports are consistent with benign code, warranting low scores.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 1 exhibits high obfuscation and malicious behavior, justifying its high scores. Other reports are benign with appropriate low scores. No adjustments are necessary; the scores are consistent with the evidence.",
