{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to execute a PowerShell command that creates a reverse TCP connection to an external IP address.",
  "sources": "The PowerShell command string assigned to 'jhtcSpPiUbnmmZejmlOSNmbcuEgPJhwW' and executed via os.system() during the install process.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing the PowerShell command, establishing an outbound TCP connection to 81.68.184.99 on port 6784.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code runs the PowerShell command which initiates a reverse shell connection to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated class name, and executing network connection code directly during install; the PowerShell command is maliciously designed as a reverse shell.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class inheriting from setuptools' install. Inside the custom method, it constructs a PowerShell reverse shell command connecting to a remote IP and port. The command reads data from the network stream, executes it with PowerShell, and sends back output, enabling remote control. The setup call incorrectly uses 'py_module' instead of 'py_modules', but that does not affect the malicious behavior. The reverse shell behavior is clearly malicious, intended for remote control or data exfiltration during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a malicious reverse shell that connects to an external IP during package installation. This is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent, typical of malware designed for remote access or command and control.",
