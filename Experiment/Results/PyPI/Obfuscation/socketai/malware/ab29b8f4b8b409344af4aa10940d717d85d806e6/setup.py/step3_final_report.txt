{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to execute a reverse shell upon installation, establishing a remote connection to IP 81.68.184.99 on port 6784, allowing remote command execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the network stream established by the PowerShell reverse shell command.",
  "sinks": "The network stream used by the PowerShell command acts as a sink where untrusted data (commands from the attacker) are received and executed, and output is sent back.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the network input (attacker commands) into the PowerShell process, which executes commands via 'iex', and the output is sent back through the same stream.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name and variable names, execution of network commands during setup, hardcoded IP and port, use of 'os.system' to run a PowerShell reverse shell, and incorrect setup parameter 'py_module' instead of 'py_modules'.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, runs a PowerShell reverse shell connecting to a specified IP and port. The reverse shell reads commands from the attacker, executes them via 'iex', and sends back the output, which is characteristic of malicious remote control. The class and variable names are obfuscated, indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. The setup call includes a suspicious parameter 'py_module', likely a typo or obfuscation. The malicious payload is executed unconditionally during installation, representing a severe security risk. The code's behavior is explicit and observable, with no false positives. The malicious activity is consistent with supply chain malware, and the overall security risk is high. The malware score should be set to 1, reflecting the clear malicious intent, and the security risk score should also be 1, given the severity of remote code execution during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious payload executing a reverse shell during installation, representing a severe security threat. The obfuscation and hardcoded IP further support malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; however, setting malware and security risk scores to 1 would more accurately reflect the severity. This package should be flagged as malicious and removed from distribution channels.",
