{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon installation, executes a PowerShell script that connects back to a remote server and establishes a reverse shell.",
  "sources": "The PowerShell command executed via os.system, which initiates a network connection to a specific IP and port, and executes arbitrary commands received over that connection.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing the PowerShell command; network socket connection and command execution via PowerShell, allowing remote control.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom install method runs, which then executes a PowerShell reverse shell that connects to 81.68.184.99:6784 and executes received commands.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name; the install class method is named with a non-descriptive name; execution of remote code during installation; direct use of os.system to run a complex PowerShell command; hardcoded IP and port in the reverse shell.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the standard installation process by defining a custom install class. Within this class, during the install process, it constructs and executes a PowerShell command that creates a reverse TCP connection to an external server. This connection allows the remote server to send commands and receive output, effectively granting remote control over the machine. The use of obfuscated class names and executing network code during install are suspicious. Hardcoded IP addresses and ports indicate potential malicious intent, such as establishing a backdoor. The code does not contain any benign or descriptive comments, nor does it appear to serve a legitimate purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes malicious behavior by establishing a reverse shell backdoor during installation, connecting to an external IP address and allowing remote command execution. This is indicative of malware or malicious activity intended to compromise the system.",
