{
  "purpose": "The code aims to set up a Python package, but it includes a malicious payload that executes a reverse shell connection via PowerShell.",
  "sources": "The code reads no user input directly; the malicious behavior is embedded within the custom install command which executes a PowerShell command via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The PowerShell command acts as a sink, creating an outbound TCP connection to an external IP address and executing commands received over the network.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom install class runs a PowerShell reverse shell command, establishing a connection to 81.68.184.99:6784 and allowing remote command execution.",
  "anomalies": "The class name is obfuscated, and the setup script contains a payload that opens a network socket and executes arbitrary commands received from the attacker, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a custom install class with an obfuscated name. Inside the install method, it calls the base install method and then executes a PowerShell reverse shell command using os.system. This command connects to a remote server, allowing remote code execution, which is a common malicious technique. The package setup includes a dummy package name and version, with an irrelevant 'py_module' parameter that might be a typo or obfuscation. Overall, the code includes a clear malicious backdoor embedded in the install routine.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious reverse shell payload that activates during package installation, enabling remote control of the compromised machine. The obfuscated class name and embedded PowerShell command strongly suggest malicious intent, indicating this package should be considered malicious.",
