{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package and execute a PowerShell command during installation.",
  "sources": "The PowerShell command string stored in the variable 'jhtcSpPiUbnmmZejmlOSNmbcuEgPJhwW' and executed via os.system().",
  "sinks": "Execution of a remote PowerShell script which connects to an external IP address (81.68.184.99) on port 6784 and provides a reverse shell functionality.",
  "flows": "The setup process triggers the custom install class, which then runs the embedded PowerShell reverse shell command, establishing a connection to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class name and variable names, executing a reverse shell during package installation, and hardcoded external IP address and port. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or installation tasks beyond these actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, when invoked during package installation, runs a PowerShell command designed to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server. The reverse shell allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target machine. The code includes obfuscated class and variable names, which suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. The PowerShell command opens a TCP connection to 81.68.184.99:6784, reads data from the attacker, executes it, and sends back the output, which is a classic reverse shell pattern. This behavior is typical of malicious payloads inserted into package install scripts to compromise systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, specifically the inclusion of a reverse shell backdoor executed during package installation. The obfuscation and hardcoded IP address further indicate malicious intent. Such code should be flagged and removed from any package distribution.",
