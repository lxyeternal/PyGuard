  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious payload executing a reverse shell during installation, representing a severe security threat. The obfuscation and hardcoded IP further support malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; however, setting malware and security risk scores to 1 would more accurately reflect the severity. This package should be flagged as malicious and removed from distribution channels."
