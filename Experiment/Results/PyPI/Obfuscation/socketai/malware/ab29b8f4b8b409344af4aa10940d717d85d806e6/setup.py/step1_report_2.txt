  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that, during installation, executes a PowerShell command to establish a reverse TCP connection to an external IP address.",
  "sources": "The PowerShell command string assigned to 'jhtcSpPiUbnmmZejmlOSNmbcuEgPJhwW' and executed via os.system() during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executing the PowerShell command, which opens a network connection to an external IP address and executes arbitrary code received over the network.",
  "flows": "The install method calls os.system() with a PowerShell command, creating a network socket, receiving commands, executing them, and sending back output.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming conventions for classes and variables; use of obfuscated class name; execution of remote code during installation; hardcoded IP address and port; reverse shell behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package. Within the custom install class, it overrides the installation method to execute a PowerShell reverse shell connecting to 81.68.184.99:6784. This establishes a persistent connection, allowing remote command execution, which is typical of malicious backdoors. The class and variable names are deliberately obfuscated, and the PowerShell command uses the -nop flag to avoid profile loading, making detection harder. The network activity during installation is suspicious and indicates malicious intent. The package's metadata does not reveal this behavior explicitly, but the code's actions are clearly malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, implementing a reverse shell during package installation. It communicates with an external server to allow remote command execution, representing a significant security risk. The obfuscation and network activity strongly suggest malicious intent.",
