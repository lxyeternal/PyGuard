  "malware_score": 0.9,
  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion for malicious behavior due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during setup. The silent error handling and concealment tactics align with common malicious techniques. Scores of approximately 0.9 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified, indicating a high probability of malicious intent."
