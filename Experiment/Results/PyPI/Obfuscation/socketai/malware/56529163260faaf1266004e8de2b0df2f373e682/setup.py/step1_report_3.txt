  "anomalies": [
    "The code connects to an external server (packageman.comlu.com) on port 80 and transmits system information without user consent.",
    "The use of obfuscated variable names and indirect encoding of data suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent.",
    "The code combines hostname, environment variables, and socket info into a payload and sends it over the network."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script imports 'distutils.core' but does not utilize it for any purpose beyond package metadata. The main malicious activity is in the try block, where it collects the hostname, environment variables, and socket info, encodes this data into a URL-encoded string, and sends it via an HTTP POST request to 'packageman.comlu.com'. The data collection includes fetching the local IP address through a socket connection, which indicates possible tracking or data exfiltration. The obfuscated variable names and the use of string concatenation for payload encoding are typical of malicious scripts attempting to conceal their behavior. The code suppresses all exceptions, preventing detection or logging of failures, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts to avoid detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and exfiltrating it to an external server without user consent. Its obfuscated variable names and network activity strongly suggest an intent to covertly gather and transmit data, fitting typical data theft or surveillance motives. The presence of these actions within a seemingly harmless setup script indicates potential supply chain abuse or malicious package behavior.",
