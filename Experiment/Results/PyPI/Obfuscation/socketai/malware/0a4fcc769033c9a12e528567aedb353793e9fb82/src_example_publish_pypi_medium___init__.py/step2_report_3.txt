  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a single static print statement: `print(\"Installing Ceedee\")`.\n   - There are no external inputs, data flows, or interactions with files, network, or environment variables.\n   - No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or complex logic is present.\n   - The code is straightforward and minimal, serving only to output a message.\n\n2. **Assessment of Maliciousness & Risks:**\n   - All reports agree that there are no signs of malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation or hidden code.\n   - The security risk score is 0, as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - The scores assigned in all reports seem reasonable and consistent with the code's simplicity.\n   - Since the code is purely informational and does not perform any malicious or suspicious actions, higher scores would be unjustified.\n   - The confidence score of 1 in all reports reflects certainty about benignity, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions are made about malicious intent; the code is straightforward.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are claimed or observed.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall, the analysis aligns well with the code's nature. No changes are necessary.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a simple, benign print statement with no security concerns.",
