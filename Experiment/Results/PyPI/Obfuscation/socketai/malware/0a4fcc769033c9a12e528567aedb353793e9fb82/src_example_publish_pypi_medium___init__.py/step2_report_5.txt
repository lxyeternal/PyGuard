  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a single print statement outputting \"Installing Ceedee\".\n   - There are no external inputs, no data flows, no file/network interactions, and no dynamic or obfuscated code.\n   - The code is extremely minimal and straightforward.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious Indicators**:\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, code injection, or obfuscation.\n   - No suspicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or access to sensitive resources.\n   - The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n4. **Any Logical Flaws or Mistakes?**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No overestimations of risk or malware potential.\n   - The reasoning that the code is harmless is sound.\n\n5. **Score Justification & Recommendations**:\n   - Since the code is just a static print statement with no external interactions, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0; no malicious activity is evident.\n   - The obfuscated score is also correctly 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign with no security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate and should not be changed.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
