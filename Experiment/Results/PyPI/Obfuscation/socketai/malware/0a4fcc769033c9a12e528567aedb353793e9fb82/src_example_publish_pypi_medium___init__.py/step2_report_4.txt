  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a single `print(\"Installing Ceedee\")` statement.\n   - There are no external inputs, data flows, or interactions with files, network, or environment variables.\n   - The code is static, minimal, and straightforward.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - No issues, anomalies, or suspicious behaviors are identified in any report.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscation.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Claims**:\n   - No report suggests any vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - The code is a simple message, typical for informational or setup scripts.\n\n5. **Assessment of Scores**:\n   - Given the code's simplicity and benign behavior, the scores seem appropriate.\n   - No adjustment needed.\n\n6. **My Overall Estimation**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n   - **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary**: The code is harmless, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final recommendation**: No changes to the scores are necessary. The code is benign.",
