{
  "purpose": "The function returns the version of the scikit-learn library installed in the environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads the sklearn library's __version__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used in a harmful way are present.",
  "flows": "The code accesses sklearn.__version__ as a source, which is then returned by the function.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, but the code itself is straightforward and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sklearn library and defines a function that returns the version string of sklearn. There are no data inputs from untrusted sources, no data leaks, no code injections, and no suspicious external communications. The function simply exposes a library attribute. The obfuscated function name may indicate an attempt to hide its purpose, but the code's behavior remains benign and typical for version retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and only retrieves and returns the sklearn library version. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
