  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the sklearn library.",
  "sources": "The import of the sklearn module and the attribute access to sklearn.__version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "Input (imported library) -> Function returning sklearn.__version__.",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no other suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sklearn library and defines a function with an obfuscated name that returns the library's version. There are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The function's purpose is benign, likely for compatibility or version checking. No user input is processed, and no external communication occurs. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation beyond the function name.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply retrieves the sklearn library version, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The obfuscated function name might be for simple code obfuscation but does not impact security. Overall, it appears safe.",
