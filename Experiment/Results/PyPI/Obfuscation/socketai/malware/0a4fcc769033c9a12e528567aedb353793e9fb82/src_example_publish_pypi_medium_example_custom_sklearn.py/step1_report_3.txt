  "flows": "Importing sklearn -> Accessing sklearn.__version__ -> Returning version string.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward with no unusual behavior or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sklearn library, which is a common machine learning package. It defines a function that simply returns the version of sklearn. There are no signs of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior. No external input, no network activity, no suspicious code flow. The function's purpose is benign and standard for version checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves only to return the sklearn library version. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are present.",
