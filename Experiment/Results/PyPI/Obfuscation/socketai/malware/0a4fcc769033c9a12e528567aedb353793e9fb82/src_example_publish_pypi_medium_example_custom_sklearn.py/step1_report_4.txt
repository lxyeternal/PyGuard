  "purpose": "Retrieve and return the version number of the sklearn library",
  "sources": "Import statement for sklearn; use of sklearn.__version__",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing the version string",
  "flows": "Import sklearn -> Access sklearn.__version__ -> Return version string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; function name is unconventional but not suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sklearn library and defines a function with a non-descriptive name. The function simply returns the version number of sklearn. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leakage, or malicious code. The function does not perform any external communication, data manipulation, or security-sensitive operations. The unconventional function name may be a result of obfuscation or automatic code generation but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility function for retrieving sklearn's version. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
