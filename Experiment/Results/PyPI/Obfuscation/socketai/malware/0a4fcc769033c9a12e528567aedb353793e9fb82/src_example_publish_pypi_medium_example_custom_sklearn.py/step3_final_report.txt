  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the sklearn library.",
  "sources": "The function reads the attribute sklearn.__version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the function simply returns a library attribute.",
  "flows": "The function accesses sklearn.__version__ and returns it directly.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is obfuscated and non-descriptive, which could be considered obfuscation but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sklearn and defines a function that returns sklearn.__version__. It contains no external inputs, network activity, or data manipulation. The obfuscated function name is the only minor anomaly, but it does not perform any malicious actions. The code is straightforward and benign, serving solely to retrieve library version information. The scores assigned in the reports—malware score of 0, low security risk, and moderate obfuscation—are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple version check with an obfuscated function name. There is no malicious activity or security risk present. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
