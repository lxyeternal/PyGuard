{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information via OS commands and sends it to an external server during package setup, likely for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls retrieving hostname, username, /etc/passwd content, OS info, current directory, directory listing, and OS detection.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to external URL with encoded system data during setup.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info commands) feed into data encoding, which then flows into the HTTP request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Collection of /etc/passwd, execution during package setup, obfuscated variable names, silent data exfiltration without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code executes multiple system commands to gather sensitive data, including /etc/passwd on Linux, and transmits this data to an external endpoint during package installation. Variable names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation. The data collection and exfiltration happen automatically, with no user notification or consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The behavior aligns with known supply chain attacks involving data theft and covert surveillance. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.85, security risk ~0.9, obfuscation ~0.8) are justified given the severity of data exfiltration and obfuscation techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior through covert collection and transmission of sensitive system data during package setup, indicating high likelihood of malware. The obfuscation and data exfiltration justify high risk and malware scores. It should be flagged as malicious and further investigated or removed.",
