  "purpose": "Assigning hardcoded strings and tuples, possibly representing version info or metadata.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flows to untrusted sources or sensitive data outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; assignments are static",
  "anomalies": "Presence of seemingly random variable names; no clear functionality; no input handling or dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with hardcoded data: an email string, a tuple with mixed data types, and a version string. There are no functions, no input handling, no external data reads, and no dynamic or obfuscated code. The variables do not interact with each other in a meaningful way, nor do they perform any operations that could indicate malicious intent. The code appears to serve as static metadata or placeholders. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only static variable assignments with no malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no indicators of security risks or malware. It appears benign and does not pose a threat.",
