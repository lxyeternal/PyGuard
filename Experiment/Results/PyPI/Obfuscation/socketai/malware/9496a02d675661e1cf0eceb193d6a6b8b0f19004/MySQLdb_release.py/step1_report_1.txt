{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define variables containing strings and tuples, likely for use in some configuration or metadata context.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments at the beginning of the code, where data is assigned to variable names.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or eval/exec functions; the code does not interact with untrusted input or perform any output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input sources to sinks; variables are assigned static values only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. Variable names are nonspecific but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with static string and tuple literals. There are no functions, no user input processing, no network activity, and no dynamic execution. The variable names are arbitrary and do not reveal any malicious pattern. The structure is straightforward and does not suggest obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign. It appears to define static data without any malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. There are no security risks or malware indications based on this snippet.",
