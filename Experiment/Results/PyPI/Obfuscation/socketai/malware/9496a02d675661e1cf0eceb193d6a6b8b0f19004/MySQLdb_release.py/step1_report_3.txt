  "purpose": "Assigning string and tuple data to variables, potentially for package metadata or configuration.",
  "sources": "Direct string and tuple assignments; no external input or data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; variables are assigned static values only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three variable assignments: a string with an email, a tuple with mixed data types, and a version string. All are static, hardcoded values without any input/output operations or external data processing. The obfuscated variable names may suggest an attempt to hide purpose, but no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be simple data initialization, possibly for package metadata or configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static data assignment with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
