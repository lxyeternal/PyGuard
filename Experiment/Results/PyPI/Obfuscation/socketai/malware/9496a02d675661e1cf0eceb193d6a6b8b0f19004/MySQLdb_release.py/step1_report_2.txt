  "purpose": "Assignment of string and tuple variables, possibly for package metadata or configuration",
  "sources": "Assignment statements assigning string and tuple literals",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sink, no output or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; variables are assigned static literals",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious patterns; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external calls",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three variable assignments: a string containing an email address, a tuple with various data types, and a version string. All are static literals, with no dynamic or external input. There are no functions, network calls, or file operations. The variables appear to represent metadata, such as author info, configuration parameters, and versioning, common in package setup scripts. No malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving likely as metadata or configuration data with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
