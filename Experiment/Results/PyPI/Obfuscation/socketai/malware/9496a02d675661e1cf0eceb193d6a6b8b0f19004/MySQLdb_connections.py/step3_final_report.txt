  "purpose": "A heavily obfuscated custom MySQL connection class extending _mysql.connection, managing connection parameters, charset, sql_mode, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for connection setup, server info, charset, and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "Execution of SQL commands like 'SET NAMES', 'SET SESSION sql_mode', 'BEGIN', and error raising.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence connection settings; data flows into configuration commands and error handling routines.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with complex variable names, dynamic method and attribute creation, redundant imports, indirect function calls, and complex inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code is a heavily obfuscated, complex extension of a MySQL connection class, likely designed to conceal proprietary logic or evade static analysis. No signs of malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration are evident within this fragment. The obfuscation and dynamic code generation are suspicious but do not confirm malicious intent. The code primarily manipulates connection settings and error handling with no external malicious interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears as a heavily obfuscated, customized MySQL connection handler with no explicit malicious activity detected. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not provide concrete evidence of malware or malicious behavior within this snippet. The low malware score (0.1) and moderate risk score (0.3) are justified based on the analysis. Further dynamic or runtime analysis is recommended if used in a security-critical environment.",
