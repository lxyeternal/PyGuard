  "purpose": "Utility functions for date, time, and timedelta parsing and conversions, as well as datetime object creation.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external data via function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions that format or parse date/time data, and functions that create datetime, date, and time objects from strings or parameters.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through parsing and formatting functions to generate date/time objects, with no evident untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no network connections or file manipulations; no cryptic or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for parsing timestamps, formatting dates, converting date/time representations, and constructing datetime objects from strings. All functions appear to process data in a straightforward manner without suspicious operations. There are no external network calls, no data exfiltration, and no use of environment variables for sensitive data. The obfuscation appears to be solely for naming complexity, not for malicious purposes. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious data handling observed. The functions operate on standard date/time data and conversions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of utility functions for date/time parsing and formatting. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attack vectors are evident. The obfuscation seems to be solely in variable and function naming, not in malicious intent. No suspicious external activity or data leaks are present.",
