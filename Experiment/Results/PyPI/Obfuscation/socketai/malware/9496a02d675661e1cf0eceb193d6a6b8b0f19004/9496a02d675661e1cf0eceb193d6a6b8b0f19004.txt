      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "This script is malicious, designed to stealthily collect and transmit system information to an external server. The obfuscation, suspicious URL, and data exfiltration confirm its malicious nature, warranting a high malware score and security alert."

      "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated database interface module with potential for misuse due to its dynamic import and obfuscation patterns. However, in the absence of evidence for malicious payloads or activity, it appears more likely to be an obfuscated utility rather than malware. Monitoring and further analysis are recommended if deployed in sensitive environments."

      "security_risk": 0.3,
      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears as a heavily obfuscated, customized MySQL connection handler with no explicit malicious activity detected. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not provide concrete evidence of malware or malicious behavior within this snippet. The low malware score (0.1) and moderate risk score (0.3) are justified based on the analysis. Further dynamic or runtime analysis is recommended if used in a security-critical environment."

      "security_risk": 0.5,
      "obfuscated": 0.9,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated database access layer with unsafe SQL query construction practices. While no malware or malicious activity is detected, the unsafe query handling poses a significant security risk, especially if inputs are untrusted. The obfuscation complicates static analysis and could conceal malicious intent if integrated into larger malicious frameworks. Overall, the code should be reviewed and refactored to use parameterized queries and de-obfuscated for clarity."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is most likely a legitimate, complex, obfuscated utility library for MySQL data handling. While the obfuscation raises some suspicion, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity or malware. The overall security risk is low, but the obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring if used in sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be utility functions with obfuscated identifiers, primarily for date/time processing and database interactions. There is no concrete evidence of malware or malicious activity. The high obfuscation and unvalidated data passing warrant caution but do not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign but should be reviewed with validation added in a broader context."
