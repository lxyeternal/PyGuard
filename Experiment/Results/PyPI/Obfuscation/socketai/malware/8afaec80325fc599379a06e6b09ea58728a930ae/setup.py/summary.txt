  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell commands during package setup, which are highly indicative of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation and stealth techniques justify elevated malware and risk scores. This pattern warrants caution, further decoding of the payload, and potential removal or detailed inspection to confirm malicious intent."
