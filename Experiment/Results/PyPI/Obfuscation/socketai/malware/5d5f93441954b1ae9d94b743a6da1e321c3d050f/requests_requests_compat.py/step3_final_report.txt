{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility support for Python 2 and 3 by performing version detection and conditional imports, ensuring code runs seamlessly across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for sys.version_info; imports modules based on Python version; accesses standard library modules for URL handling, JSON parsing, and cookies.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Version detection leads to conditional imports; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks as the code only sets up environment compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward version checks and imports; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard compatibility layer that detects Python version and imports appropriate modules accordingly. It uses well-known patterns for cross-version support without processing untrusted data or performing network operations. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior is evident. The code relies solely on standard libraries and conditional logic, which is typical for such compatibility modules. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1 are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility layer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
