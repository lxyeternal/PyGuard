{
  "purpose": "The code aims to provide compatibility across Python 2 and Python 3 by importing appropriate modules and defining type aliases accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads the Python version information from sys.version_info to determine the Python version in use.",
  "sinks": "Uses conditional imports based on Python version; no direct data sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Version info source leads to conditional import logic, setting up environment-specific modules and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors; the code is straightforward and designed for compatibility. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious modules, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python version and imports modules accordingly to ensure compatibility between Python 2 and 3. It handles potential import errors for json and defines type aliases. All operations are standard for cross-version support. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The only notable aspect is the careful handling of different Python environments, which is common in open-source compatibility libraries.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or suspicious activities.",
