{
  "purpose": "Define compatibility and import modules based on Python version",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, module imports (simplejson/json, urllib, urlparse, cookielib, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No direct sink points for untrusted data or actions; the code mainly imports modules",
  "flows": "Data flows from version checks to conditional imports, no untrusted data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code establishes Python 2/3 compatibility by importing appropriate modules and defining type aliases. It uses standard library imports and handles missing modules gracefully. No suspicious or malicious actions are evident. The code does not perform any network activity, data manipulation, or security-sensitive operations beyond module imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility layer for different Python versions with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
