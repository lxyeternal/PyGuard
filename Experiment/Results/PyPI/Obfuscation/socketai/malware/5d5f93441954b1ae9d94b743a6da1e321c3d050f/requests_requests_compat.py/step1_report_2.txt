{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility support for different Python versions, handling imports, type definitions, and version-specific modules.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as sys, json, urllib, urlparse, cookielib, StringIO, and collections; reads Python version info.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows involving untrusted input are present; code primarily sets up environment and compatibility variables.",
  "flows": "No significant source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; mainly conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hard-coded secrets, or obfuscation. The code adapts imports based on Python version, which is standard practice. No suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python runtime version to conditionally import modules and define types accordingly, supporting compatibility between Python 2 and 3. It uses try-except for safe import of 'simplejson', and version-based imports for URL handling, cookie management, and string types. All imported modules are standard, and no suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. No data leakage, code injection, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a compatibility layer that ensures the correct modules and types are used depending on the Python version. It employs standard, benign practices without malicious intent or security risks.",
