{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility functions and imports for Python 2 and 3, facilitating cross-version support for JSON handling, URL parsing, and cookie management.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info (to determine Python version), imports of standard libraries and packages such as json, urllib, urlparse, cookielib, StringIO, and collections.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The code assigns imported modules and functions based on Python version, without processing or handling untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code mainly performs conditional imports and type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The script detects Python version and conditionally imports modules for compatibility. It assigns type variables and imports functions accordingly. All operations involve standard library imports and version checks, with no execution of untrusted input or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility shim for different Python versions with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It does not process untrusted data or include suspicious behavior.",
