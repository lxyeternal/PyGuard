{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility functions for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, importing necessary modules and defining type aliases accordingly.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current Python version from sys.version_info to determine environment, and imports various modules based on the environment (e.g., sys, json, urllib, http, collections).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data are present; the code mainly performs imports and environment setup.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking Python version, then conditionally importing modules and defining variables based on the version; no data processing or flow from source to sink is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard conditional imports for compatibility; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation observed. It primarily sets up environment-specific aliases and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward compatibility code, importing standard libraries based on Python version. No data is read from untrusted sources or written to untrusted sinks. There are no malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. All imports are from Python's standard library or known third-party packages for compatibility. The structure and format are typical for version compatibility modules. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility layer for supporting multiple Python versions. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security risks. It simply manages module imports and type definitions based on the Python version environment.",
