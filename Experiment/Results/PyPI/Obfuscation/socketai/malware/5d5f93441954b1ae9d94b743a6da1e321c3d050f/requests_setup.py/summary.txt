  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with minimal security concern. No malicious activity is detected. The only potential risk stems from executing system commands via 'os.system', which is standard in such scripts but should be used cautiously. The scores of zero for malware and obfuscation and a low risk score are appropriate and justified."
