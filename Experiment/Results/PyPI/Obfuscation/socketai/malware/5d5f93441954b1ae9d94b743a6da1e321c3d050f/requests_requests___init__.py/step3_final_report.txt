  "purpose": "This code initializes the 'requests' library, setting metadata, attempting to enable SSL support via pyopenssl, and configuring logging with NullHandler.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules, optional import of pyopenssl for SSL support, and logging setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks, no network requests or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only sets up environment and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is standard setup code with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup for the 'requests' library, involving metadata definitions, optional SSL support via pyopenssl, and logging configuration. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present. The optional import of pyopenssl is a common practice for SSL support, not malicious. The logging setup suppresses warnings without security implications. There are no data flows, external inputs, or network activity in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.",
