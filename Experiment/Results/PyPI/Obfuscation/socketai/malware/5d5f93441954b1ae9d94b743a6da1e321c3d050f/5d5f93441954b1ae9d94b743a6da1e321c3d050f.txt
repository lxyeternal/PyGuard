      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through silent data exfiltration during installation, targeting a suspicious domain. The behavior is privacy-invasive and potentially part of malicious tracking or data theft. The malware score should be set at 0.9, the obfuscation score at 0, and the security risk at 0.9, indicating high severity and malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with minimal security concern. No malicious activity is detected. The only potential risk stems from executing system commands via 'os.system', which is standard in such scripts but should be used cautiously. The scores of zero for malware and obfuscation and a low risk score are appropriate and justified."

The use of hooks and data encoding features are standard and intended for flexibility. The overall security assessment is very low risk, with a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The risk score can be set at 0.2 to account for the potential misuse of hooks, but this is an expected feature, not a vulnerability."
