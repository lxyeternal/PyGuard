  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for cookie management, including extraction, header creation, and compatibility wrappers for cookie handling in HTTP requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Reading request headers, URL parsing, cookie attributes, response headers, and response message objects.",
  "sinks": "Generation of cookie headers, extraction of cookies into a jar, removal of cookies by name, and merging of cookie jars.",
  "flows": "Input data from request headers and response headers flow into cookie extraction, header generation, and cookie management functions, with no network or system modification activities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of threading for thread safety is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard cookie management utilities, wrapping request and response objects to facilitate cookie extraction, header creation, and cookie jar operations. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and rely on known libraries. The low risk scores assigned in the reports (0 or 0.1) are appropriate, reflecting minimal inherent security concern but acknowledging potential misuse if misconfigured. Confidence levels are high, and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for cookie handling with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are justified and accurate. The overall security assessment is that the code is safe for use.",
