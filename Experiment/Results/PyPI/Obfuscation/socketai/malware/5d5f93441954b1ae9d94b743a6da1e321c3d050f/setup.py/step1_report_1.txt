{
  "purpose": "This code customizes the installation process for a Python package, and during installation, it collects system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via requests.get() to an external domain, which could lead to data leakage.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (hostname, cwd, username) flows into the requests.get() call, transmitting to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded, suspicious domain ('jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com') and automatic data exfiltration during package installation; no user consent or transparency.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the standard installation process to include a request that transmits system information to a third-party server. It uses common modules (setuptools, requests, socket, getpass, os). The data sent includes hostname, current directory, and username, which could be used for tracking or profiling without user consent. The domain appears suspicious and is likely controlled by an attacker or malicious actor. No obfuscated code or malware-like payloads are present besides data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an unauthorized data transmission during package installation, which is malicious behavior indicative of a privacy violation or potential command-and-control setup. This is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious.",
