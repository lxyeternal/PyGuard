  "purpose": "Custom installation script that extends setuptools' install process to perform additional actions during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), requests.get()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() sending data to external domain",
  "flows": "During installation, gather hostname, current working directory, username, then send this data via HTTP GET request to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code execution during package installation; data exfiltration to external server; use of obscure domain; no user consent or notification.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon execution, retrieves system information (hostname, current directory, username) and sends this data to a suspicious external domain via an HTTP GET request. The domain 'jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com' appears malicious and likely used for tracking or data exfiltration. The package setup uses a non-descriptive name and includes the custom install class, which means this behavior will occur during installation, potentially without user awareness. There are no signs of obfuscation or code complexity, but the behavior itself is suspicious and indicates intentional data harvesting during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a hidden data exfiltration mechanism during package installation, sending system info to an external suspicious domain. This behavior suggests malicious intent or privacy violation, warranting concern and further scrutiny before use.",
