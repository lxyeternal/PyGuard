{
  "purpose": "The code performs a malicious data exfiltration during package installation by sending system information to a suspicious external domain.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to a suspicious domain with collected data as parameters",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, cwd, username) → requests.get() call to external domain",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration during installation without user consent, sending data to a suspicious domain",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during package installation, collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain. The setup uses this class, so the behavior executes automatically during installation. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but performs unauthorized data exfiltration, indicating malicious intent. The signals include the suspicious domain, the data collection, and the timing during install. The behavior aligns with malicious activity, and the scores should reflect high severity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through silent data exfiltration during installation, targeting a suspicious domain. The behavior is privacy-invasive and potentially part of malicious tracking or data theft. The malware score should be set at 0.9, the obfuscation score at 0, and the security risk at 0.9, indicating high severity and malicious intent.",
