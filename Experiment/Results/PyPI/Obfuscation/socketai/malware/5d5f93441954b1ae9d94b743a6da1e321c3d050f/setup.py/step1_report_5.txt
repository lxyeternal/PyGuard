  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process of a Python package to send system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with external URL and parameters",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, cwd, username) flow into the request URL as parameters to be sent externally",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded domain (jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com) for data exfiltration; no input validation; sending system info without user consent",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, after executing the normal installation process, collects hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external server. The URL appears obfuscated or generated, suggesting an attempt at data exfiltration or tracking. No other malicious actions or suspicious code patterns are detected. The use of requests to transmit system info without encryption or user consent indicates malicious intent or at least privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to exfiltrate system information during package installation by sending data to an external server. This behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, indicating malicious intent for tracking or data theft.",
