  "purpose": "To customize the installation process of a Python package and send system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to send data to external domain",
  "flows": "Data collected from hostname, current working directory, and username flows from sources to requests.get() call which transmits data to an external server",
  "anomalies": "The code exfiltrates system information to an external domain during installation without user consent; the domain appears suspicious or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during installation, collects hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL. This behavior is not typical for package installation and indicates potential malicious intent such as data exfiltration. The code does not perform any validation, encryption, or user notification about this action. The external URL appears suspicious, which could indicate malicious tracking or malicious command and control behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation to an external server. The behavior is malicious, likely intended for tracking or unauthorized data collection, and should be considered dangerous.",
