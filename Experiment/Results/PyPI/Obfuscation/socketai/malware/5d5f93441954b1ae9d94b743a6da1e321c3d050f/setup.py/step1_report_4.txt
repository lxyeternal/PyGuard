{
  "purpose": "Define a custom installation process that, upon package installation, collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data via an HTTP GET request to a remote server (requests.get).",
  "flows": "System info sources are gathered in the run method of CustomInstall and immediately sent to the remote server through an HTTP request.",
  "anomalies": "The remote URL (oastify.com domain) is suspiciously embedded; data is sent during installation without user consent; no error handling or data validation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration with a custom install class. During installation, it retrieves hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data to an external server via an HTTP GET request. This behavior resembles data exfiltration. The remote server's domain appears suspicious. There are no safeguards, user prompts, or obfuscation; the code executes automatically during package installation. These activities indicate malicious intent or at least privacy invasion. No other potentially malicious behaviors or backdoors are present, but the data exfiltration is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly collects system information and transmits it to a suspicious external server during package installation, indicating malicious behavior and privacy violation. It is highly concerning and should be flagged for review or removal.",
