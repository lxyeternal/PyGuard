{
  "purpose": "Provide a function to locate the default CA certificate bundle, primarily used for SSL/TLS verification in HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import 'certifi' to determine the certificate bundle location. It also reads the file path for 'cacert.pem' if 'certifi' is not available.",
  "sinks": "The function 'where()' outputs a file path, used as a trusted CA bundle location; no untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "The code tries to import 'where' from 'certifi'. If successful, 'where()' is used to get the bundle path. If not, it defaults to a local 'cacert.pem' file. The main block prints the result of 'where()'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code performs a simple fallback for CA bundle location without any suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script aims to determine the location of a trusted CA bundle. It first attempts to import 'where' from 'certifi', a common SSL certificate package. If unavailable, it defines a fallback function that returns a local 'cacert.pem' path within the same directory. The main block prints this location. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for SSL certificate handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a legitimate purpose related to SSL certificate management. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
