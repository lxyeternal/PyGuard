{
  "purpose": "Provides a method to retrieve the default CA certificate bundle path, either via certifi or a vendored bundle.",
  "sources": "Imports certifi (if available) or defaults to local 'cacert.pem' in the same directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only returns a file path based on static or imported data.",
  "flows": "Calls 'where()' which returns a file path; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple utility code with conditional fallback.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import 'where' from certifi; if not available, defines a local 'where' that returns a path to 'cacert.pem' in the same directory. When run directly, it prints this path. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns. It solely handles file path retrieval for CA certificates, with no network or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a legitimate purpose of providing CA bundle locations. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
