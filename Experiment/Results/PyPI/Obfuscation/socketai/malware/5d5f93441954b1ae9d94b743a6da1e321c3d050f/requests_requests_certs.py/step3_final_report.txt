  "purpose": "Provides the location of the default CA certificate bundle, either via certifi or a local fallback.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from certifi; fallback function returning local 'cacert.pem' path.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Import certifi -> use 'where' -> print result; fallback function constructs path -> print.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'where' from certifi; if unavailable, defines a fallback returning a local 'cacert.pem' path. When run directly, it prints the CA bundle location. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The fallback relies on a local file, which could be replaced maliciously outside static analysis, but this is a common pattern and outside the scope of static review. The code is simple, clear, and standard for SSL certificate handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for locating CA certificates with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The fallback mechanism poses a minimal security risk if the local file is tampered with, but this is outside static analysis scope. Overall, the code is safe and standard.",
