{
  "purpose": "Provides a function to return the default CA certificate bundle location, either from certifi or a local fallback.",
  "sources": "Importing certifi's where() function or defining a fallback within the module; reading __file__ to locate 'cacert.pem'.",
  "sinks": "Returning a file path for a CA bundle; no untrusted data handling or external inputs beyond standard imports.",
  "flows": "Code imports or defines 'where', then returns the path to 'cacert.pem' when executed directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard methods to locate a certificate bundle; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'where' from certifi, falling back to a local 'cacert.pem' file if import fails. The fallback function constructs a path relative to the script's directory. When run as a script, it prints the CA bundle path. There are no external data inputs, no suspicious logic, and no obfuscated code. It is a simple utility to locate CA certificates.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for locating CA bundle files. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and follows standard practices.",
