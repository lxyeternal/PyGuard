{
  "purpose": "Provide the path to the default CA certificate bundle used for SSL verification.",
  "sources": "Import of 'certifi.where' and the fallback function that returns a local 'cacert.pem' file path.",
  "targets": "The function 'where()' returns a file path; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Code attempts to import 'certifi.where' and if unavailable, returns a local file path. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The fallback function uses a local file path, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script's primary function is to locate the CA bundle for SSL verification. It tries to import 'certifi' to get the standard bundle location; if not installed, it defaults to a local 'cacert.pem' file in the same directory. The code includes a main block that prints this path. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, malicious code execution, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for retrieving a CA bundle location with no malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to standard practices for fallback mechanisms without introducing vulnerabilities.",
