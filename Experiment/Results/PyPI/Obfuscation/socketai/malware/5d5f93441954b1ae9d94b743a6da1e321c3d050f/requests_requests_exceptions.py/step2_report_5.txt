  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - The code solely defines custom exception classes for handling various HTTP and request-related errors.\n   - It imports `HTTPError` from `urllib3.exceptions`.\n   - No data processing, network activity, or input/output operations are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The purpose is purely to categorize and handle errors systematically within a request library.\n\n2. **Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n   - No obfuscation or code that could be used maliciously.\n   - The code is standard for a request handling library, typical in open source projects.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as no malicious behavior is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable class definitions.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - The purpose, analysis, and conclusions are aligned with the code content.\n   - No overestimations of risk or malware are evident.\n   - The code is a typical, safe component of a request library.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is non-malicious, non-obfuscated, and carries no security risk.\n   - The scores assigned in all reports seem appropriate and justified.\n   - The detailed analysis correctly identifies the code as standard exception definitions.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are accurate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The code is safe, and the reports' conclusions are justified.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the actual code content.",
