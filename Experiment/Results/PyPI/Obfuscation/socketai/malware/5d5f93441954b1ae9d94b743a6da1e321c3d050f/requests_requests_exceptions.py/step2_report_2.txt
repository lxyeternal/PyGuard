  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a set of exception class definitions for a requests-like library.\n- It imports an exception from urllib3.exceptions and defines various custom exceptions inheriting from standard Python exceptions.\n- No data input/output, external data handling, or network activity occurs.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose appears to be standard error categorization and handling.\n\n**Review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose and analysis are accurate.  \n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.  \n- Confidence: 1, Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, consistent and accurate.  \n- No suspicious elements.  \n- Confidence: 1.0, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Properly notes the import and class hierarchy.  \n- No external data, no malicious behavior.  \n- Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Reiterates the standard nature of the code.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious activity.  \n- Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same as above, consistent assessment.  \n- No issues found.  \n- Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk score:** 0; no security risk or vulnerabilities present.\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; the code is purely definitional.\n- No need to adjust scores; they reflect the actual content well.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is standard and benign.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a typical, safe set of exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
