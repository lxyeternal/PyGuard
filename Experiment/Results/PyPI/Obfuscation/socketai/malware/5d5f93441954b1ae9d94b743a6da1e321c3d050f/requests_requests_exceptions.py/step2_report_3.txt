  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines a set of custom exception classes for handling various HTTP and request-related errors.\n- It imports `HTTPError` from `urllib3.exceptions`.\n- All classes inherit from standard Python exceptions or other custom exceptions.\n- The code is purely class definitions, with no data processing, network activity, or external input/output.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports agree that the code is standard, benign, and purely definitional. There are no malicious behaviors, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and correctly identify that this is a straightforward exception class module.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  None of the reports justify higher scores, and given the code's content, none are warranted.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The code does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All assessments are based on direct code analysis, with no unwarranted assumptions.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe, and non-malicious set of exception class definitions for a request handling library.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- No further action needed. The code is benign.\n- The high confidence scores (1.0) are justified.\n- No anomalies or suspicious elements detected.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe overall security risk is negligible, and the code is safe. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.",
