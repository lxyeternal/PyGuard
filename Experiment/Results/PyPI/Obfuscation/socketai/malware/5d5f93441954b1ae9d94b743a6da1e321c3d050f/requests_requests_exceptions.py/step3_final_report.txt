{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of custom exception classes for handling various HTTP and request-related errors within a request library. It provides structured error categorization for network operations, enabling consistent exception handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statement (`from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as BaseHTTPError`) and class definitions that do not involve external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code solely consists of class definitions for exception handling.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; the code only establishes class hierarchies for error categorization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, with clear class definitions and standard imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for a request handling library. It imports an exception from urllib3.exceptions and defines multiple custom exceptions inheriting from built-in Python exceptions or other custom exceptions. No data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The purpose is purely to categorize and handle errors systematically. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard component of an error handling module for a request library. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores and assessments are justified and should remain as is.",
