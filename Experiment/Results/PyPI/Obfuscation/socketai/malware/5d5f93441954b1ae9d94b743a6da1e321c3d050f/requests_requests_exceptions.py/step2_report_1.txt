  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward, defining custom exception classes for the requests library.\n- The code only involves class definitions, imports, and docstrings.\n- No data input/output, network operations, or external data processing occurs.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The purpose is purely to categorize and handle errors in a standard, expected manner.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: it's a typical exception hierarchy for a request handling library.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk = 0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature and the code's purpose, there's no indication of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- The import from `urllib3.exceptions` is standard for such libraries and does not raise suspicion.\n- The exception classes are well-structured and typical for error handling modules.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- Malware score: 0 is appropriate, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is appropriate, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Risk score: 0 is appropriate, as there's no security risk or vulnerability.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, safe component of a request library.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and conclusions in the reports are justified and accurate.",
