  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling errors in the requests library.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or sensitive information are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes for the requests library, inheriting from standard Python exception classes. It imports a specific exception from urllib3.exceptions. All classes are standard and serve to categorize request errors. No external data is read, and there are no dangerous operations, no code injection, nor obfuscated or malicious constructs. The module appears to be purely definitional, with no malicious intent or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for request handling. No malicious activity, suspicious patterns, or security risks are evident.",
