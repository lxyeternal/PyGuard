  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various HTTP and request-related errors in the requests library.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and imports.",
  "sinks": "None; no data handling or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code consists solely of class definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code are present. The code is standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific exception and defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions and other request-related exceptions. The purpose is to categorize and handle various request errors systematically. No input/output, no data processing, no network connections, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured set of exception definitions typical for a requests-like library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for exception handling and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. It is standard, non-malicious, and safe.",
