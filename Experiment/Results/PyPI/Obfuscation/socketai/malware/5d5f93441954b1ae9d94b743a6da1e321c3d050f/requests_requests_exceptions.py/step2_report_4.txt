  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code defines a set of custom exception classes for a request handling library.\n   - It imports `HTTPError` from `urllib3.exceptions`.\n   - The classes inherit from standard Python exceptions (`IOError`, `ValueError`, `TypeError`) and from each other.\n   - No data processing, external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - The code is purely for exception categorization and handling.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or code that could be exploited.\n   - The code is standard for an exception module in a request library.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and human-readable.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0, since the code is benign and does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as standard, non-malicious exception definitions.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The purpose and logic are consistent across reports.\n\n5. **Summary and Final Assessment:**\n   - The code is a typical, safe set of exception class definitions.\n   - No changes needed to scores or conclusions.\n   - The detailed analysis confirms that the code is benign and does not pose security risks.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with all reports and the code content.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The existing scores and assessments are appropriate.",
