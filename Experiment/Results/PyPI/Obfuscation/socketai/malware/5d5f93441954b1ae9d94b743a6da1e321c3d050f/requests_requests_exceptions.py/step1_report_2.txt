  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various request errors in the requests library.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and imports exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected. The code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an exception from a third-party library and defines multiple custom exception classes, inheriting from standard Python exceptions and other custom classes. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The class initializers and docstrings are typical for exception handling and do not exhibit malicious intent. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for a request handling library. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
