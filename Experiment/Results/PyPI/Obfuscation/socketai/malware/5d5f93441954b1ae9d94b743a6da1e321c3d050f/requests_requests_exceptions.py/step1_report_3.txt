  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various error scenarios in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Import of urllib3.exceptions for HTTPError; custom exception class initializations and attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "None directly involved; exceptions are used for control flow and error handling, not data leakage or external effects.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised during request processing; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Code appears standard for exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions related to HTTP request handling. It imports a specific exception class, extends standard Python exception classes, and initializes exception objects with relevant request and response data. There are no input sources, external data flows, or output sinks. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The purpose is purely to facilitate error handling in the Requests library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for request handling errors. No malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks are detected. It is a typical, benign component of a network request library.",
