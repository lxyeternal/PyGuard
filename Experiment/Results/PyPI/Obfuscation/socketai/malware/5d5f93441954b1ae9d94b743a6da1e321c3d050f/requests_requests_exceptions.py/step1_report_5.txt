  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various errors in the requests library.",
  "sources": "None (defines exception classes, no data input sources).",
  "sinks": "None (no data sinks or external data processing).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from sources to sinks, as this is a module defining exceptions).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling in the requests library. It imports a specific exception and defines subclasses for various error types, with descriptive docstrings. There are no data inputs, external communications, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The structure and purpose are consistent with standard error handling patterns, and there are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward definition of exception classes used for error handling in the requests library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and does not pose security risks.",
