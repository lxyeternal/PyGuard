  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used in request handling.",
  "sources": "Input data during initialization (__init__ methods), data access via __getitem__ and get methods.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks, as data is stored in dictionaries and returned without processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from initialization inputs to internal storage; retrieval from internal storage to output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. Both are standard data structures for internal data management. No external network activity, no sensitive data leaks, no code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code does not interact with external systems, write to files, or perform any potentially malicious operations. The usage of collections.MutableMapping is proper; no unsafe functions or behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard, safe utility classes for managing dictionaries with specific behaviors. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The code contains no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
