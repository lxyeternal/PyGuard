{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data during the instantiation of the classes (e.g., data and kwargs in __init__ methods). No external data sources or user inputs are explicitly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to security issues such as data leakage or system modification are present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily processes in-memory data structures without external data flows or network communications.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. It implements standard, well-understood data structures with clear purposes.",
  "analysis": "The classes 'CaseInsensitiveDict' and 'LookupDict' are straightforward implementations of case-insensitive and generic dictionaries. They do not perform any system modifications, network communication, or data leakage. No external input or output sources are involved beyond standard data structure methods. The code uses common Python features and standard library modules without any obfuscation or suspicious constructs. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malicious backdoors, or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign implementation of data structures used within the Requests library. It does not contain malware, malicious code, or security risks. The purpose is solely to facilitate case-insensitive key handling in dictionaries.",
