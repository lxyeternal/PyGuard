  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used in HTTP request handling.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily defines classes and data structures without external input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no external data sinks or network interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code uses standard Python features and idioms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. CaseInsensitiveDict provides a case-insensitive dictionary-like object primarily used for HTTP headers, ensuring key lookups ignore case differences. It stores original key casing for representation and uses lowercase keys internally. LookupDict is a simple dictionary wrapper that allows for optional name annotation and provides a custom __getitem__ method that retrieves values from __dict__, defaulting to None if not present. Both classes rely on standard Python data structures and methods without executing untrusted code or external inputs. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious code injections. The code appears to serve legitimate purposes related to request data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation of case-insensitive and lookup dictionaries for request processing. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It functions as intended for handling HTTP headers and request data without external data sources or sinks. Overall, it is safe and non-malicious.",
