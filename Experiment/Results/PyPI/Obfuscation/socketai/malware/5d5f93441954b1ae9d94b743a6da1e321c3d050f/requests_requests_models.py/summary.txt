  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured HTTP client implementation with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The use of hooks and data encoding features are standard and intended for flexibility. The overall security assessment is very low risk, with a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The risk score can be set at 0.2 to account for the potential misuse of hooks, but this is an expected feature, not a vulnerability."
