{
  "purpose": "The code performs data processing, potentially involving environment variables, user input, or external files, with no explicit malicious intent observed.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external files",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, system commands",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks such as network or file systems",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code appears standard with no signs of malicious behavior. The absence of obfuscation, suspicious external connections, or hardcoded secrets supports a benign assessment. The use of dynamic execution functions like eval/exec is not present or not exploited maliciously in the provided context. The confidence level is moderate, given the limited code details, but no indicators suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign based on current analysis, with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The risk remains low, and the scores are appropriate.",
