      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion for malicious behavior due to stealthy, obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup. The use of encoded commands, silent execution, and broad exception handling are red flags. Scores of malware (0.8), obfuscated (0.9), and high security risk (0.8) are justified. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent, but current evidence warrants high alert and potential removal or further investigation."
