{
  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for a Python package with obfuscated identifiers and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The variable assignment for version string, the setup() call with package name and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potential misuse of dependencies, obfuscated variable and package names, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated variable assigned but unused; dependencies listed for installation; no runtime data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable name for version, non-descriptive package name, no functional code beyond setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable and package names. No malicious code, network activity, or data processing is present. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. Dependencies are common but could be exploited if malicious. No active malicious behavior detected. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not elevate malware or security risk scores significantly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation, serving as a setup script with obfuscation that could be used to hide malicious intent in a broader package. No evidence of malicious activity or active security threats is present.",
