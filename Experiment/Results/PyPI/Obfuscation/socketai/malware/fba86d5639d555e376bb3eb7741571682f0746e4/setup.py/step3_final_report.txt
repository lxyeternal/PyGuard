    "Dynamic imports and system API calls are invoked based on decoded conditions.",
    "File and shortcut creation, system modifications, and potential privilege escalation occur depending on control flow."

  "anomalies": [
    "Heavy obfuscation with layered bitwise, shift, and complex calculations.",
    "Dynamic string construction using complex expressions and character manipulations.",
    "Variable names in non-Latin characters and nonsensical sequences.",
    "Multiple nested conditions and loops designed to conceal malicious intent.",
    "Use of system API calls and privilege checks in obfuscated manner."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated, employing complex calculations, dynamic string assembly, and indirect control flow to mask its true purpose. It performs actions such as installing packages via pip, creating shortcuts, manipulating files, and checking for admin privileges, all of which are typical behaviors in malware or malicious supply chain attacks. The obfuscation and system interactions suggest intent to evade detection and execute malicious payloads. The presence of conditional system modifications, environment checks, and dynamic imports further reinforce suspicion of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious and likely malicious, designed to perform system modifications, package installations, and file manipulations under obfuscated conditions. It exhibits signs of malware, including stealthy behavior, potential privilege escalation, and payload delivery mechanisms. It should be considered unsafe and flagged for high security risk.",
