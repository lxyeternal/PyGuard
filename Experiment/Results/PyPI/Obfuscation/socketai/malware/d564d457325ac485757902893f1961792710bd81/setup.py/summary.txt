  "conclusion": "The code exhibits typical malicious behavior through obfuscated, silent PowerShell execution triggered during setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The scores across reports are consistent with this assessment, with minor adjustments to malware scores (up to 0.85) for consistency. Overall, the package should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious pending further decoding of the payload."
