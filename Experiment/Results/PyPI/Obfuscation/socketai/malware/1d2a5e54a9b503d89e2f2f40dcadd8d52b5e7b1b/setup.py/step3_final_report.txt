  "purpose": "Detects and executes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess call executing encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of obfuscated PowerShell command with hidden window flags; potential for malicious payloads or remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers subprocess call; subprocess runs encoded PowerShell command silently; no further data flow visible.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Base64-encoded, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup; conditional execution based on directory existence.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a directory existence check, and if absent, executes a subprocess running a Base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window flags. The obfuscation and covert execution are suspicious indicators of malicious intent. The setup() function appears benign, but the conditional, hidden payload execution is a red flag. The encoded command's purpose cannot be determined without decoding, but the pattern suggests potential malicious activity. The high obfuscation and stealthy execution justify elevated malware and security risk scores. The behavior aligns with common tactics in supply chain attacks or malware delivery during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious indicators through obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during setup. While the exact payload remains unknown without decoding, the suspicious pattern warrants high security concern. The scores assigned by the reports are consistent and justified given the evidence.",
