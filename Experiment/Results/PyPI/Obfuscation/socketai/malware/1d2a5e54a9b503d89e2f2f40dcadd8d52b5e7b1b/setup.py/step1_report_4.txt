{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it includes additional code that attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command, which suggests malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads the file system with os.path.exists, and executes a subprocess with subprocess.Popen, running a PowerShell command encoded in Base64.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executes a PowerShell command, which can lead to remote code execution or system compromise if the command is malicious.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code triggers subprocess.Popen to run a hidden PowerShell command; the flow is from the filesystem check to execution of remote-encoded PowerShell command.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated Base64-encoded PowerShell command, execution of hidden processes, use of try-except blocks to silently ignore errors, and setup code unrelated to package configuration are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a standard setup import but then checks for a directory named 'tahg'. If absent, it executes a subprocess that runs a PowerShell command encoded in Base64. The command is hidden with -WindowStyle Hidden and is run without creating a window, which is typical of malicious or covert activities. The setup() call appears legitimate, but it is wrapped in a try-except to silently ignore errors. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands and silent execution indicates potential malicious intent, possibly downloading or executing malicious payloads without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior, notably the silent execution of an encoded PowerShell command when a certain directory does not exist. This is indicative of an attempt to perform covert actions, such as downloading or executing malicious code. While the setup() function is standard, the embedded PowerShell execution elevates the risk significantly.",
