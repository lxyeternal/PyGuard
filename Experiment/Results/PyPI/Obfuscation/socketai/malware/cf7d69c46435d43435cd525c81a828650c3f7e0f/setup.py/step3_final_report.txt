  "purpose": "Execute a PowerShell command encoded in base64 during setup if 'tahg' directory does not exist, potentially for malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Check for 'tahg' directory; os.path.exists('tahg')",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command with hidden window",
  "flows": "os.path.exists('tahg') -> subprocess.Popen with encoded command",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command executed silently; error handling suppressed; obfuscation via base64",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the existence of 'tahg' directory; if absent, it runs a subprocess executing a base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window flags. The command is not decoded, raising suspicion of obfuscation. The setup() call is standard, but the prior behavior suggests potential malicious intent. Silent error handling may hide failures. The pattern of executing obfuscated commands during setup is characteristic of malware or backdoors. Scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.75, obfuscated ~0.9, risk ~0.75-0.8) are justified given the behavior. Without decoding the command, certainty is limited, but the pattern indicates high suspicion of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion for malicious activity due to execution of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell commands during setup. The pattern aligns with malware tactics. Scores are consistent with this assessment, though decoding the command would provide definitive evidence.",
