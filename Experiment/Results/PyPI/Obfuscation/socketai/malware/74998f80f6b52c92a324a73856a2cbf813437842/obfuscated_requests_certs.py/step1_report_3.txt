{
  "purpose": "The code prints the file path to the CA bundle provided by the certifi library.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function from the certifi library, which retrieves the path to the CA bundle.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leaks or security effects; the code only outputs a file path.",
  "flows": "No external input sources; the data flow is limited to calling 'where()' and printing its output.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code performs a simple, standard library function call and print.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from the certifi package and prints its return value. It involves no user input, environment variables, or external network connections. The use of certifi is standard for verifying SSL certificates and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign operation, simply printing the path to the trusted CA bundle. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks.",
