  "purpose": "Retrieve and print the path to the trusted CA bundle provided by the certifi library.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from certifi, calling 'where()' function.",
  "sinks": "Outputting the CA bundle path to stdout.",
  "flows": "Import 'where' -> call 'where()' -> print the path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of certifi library. No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' library and prints the path to the CA bundle. The code is minimal, simple, and performs a legitimate operation related to SSL certificate verification. No untrusted input, no data leakage, no suspicious network activity, or obfuscation. The usage is standard and consistent with normal library functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply prints the path to the trusted CA bundle provided by the certifi package. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script.",
