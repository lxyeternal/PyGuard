{
  "purpose": "The code outputs the file path to the trusted CA certificates bundle used by certifi.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function from the 'certifi' library, which reads the CA bundle path from the environment or internal configuration.",
  "sinks": "The code only prints the CA bundle path; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Input source is the 'where' function, which retrieves a static file path; no untrusted data flows to other parts of the system.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' and prints the CA bundle path. It runs as a main program but does not accept external input or perform network or file operations beyond retrieving a known certificate bundle path. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple utility script that outputs the path to the CA certificates bundle used by 'certifi'. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and standard.",
