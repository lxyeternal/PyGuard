{
  "purpose": "To output the file path of the trusted CA bundle provided by the 'certifi' library.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' library",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statement outputs the CA bundle path; no untrusted data processing or leaks observed",
  "flows": "Source: 'where()' -> Sink: 'print()' output to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from 'certifi', then prints the result when executed as a script. The purpose appears to be to display the path to the trusted CA bundle. No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are involved. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. It simply outputs a known static resource location provided by a well-maintained library.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign script intended to display the location of the trusted CA bundle. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
