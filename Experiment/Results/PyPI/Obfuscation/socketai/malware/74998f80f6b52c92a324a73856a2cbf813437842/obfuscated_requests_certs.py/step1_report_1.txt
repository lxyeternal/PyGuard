  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; simple package function call",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function from a reputable library (certifi) that provides the location of CA certificates. It then prints this location when run directly. The code performs a benign, intended action with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious code paths. No user input, no external data sources, and no dynamic code execution are involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, safe, and serves a legitimate purpose of displaying the certifi CA bundle path. There are no indicators of malicious activity or security risks.",
