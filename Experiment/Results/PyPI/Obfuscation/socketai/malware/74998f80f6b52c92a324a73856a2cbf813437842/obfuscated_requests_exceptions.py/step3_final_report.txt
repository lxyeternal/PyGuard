{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for HTTP errors with obfuscated attribute names and string constants.",
  "sources": "Class initializations, attribute assignments, import statements.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network calls, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Class definitions and attribute assignments; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated attribute names and string constants with no clear functional purpose; superficial obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various HTTP-related exceptions, with obfuscated attribute names and string constants that appear superficial. No malicious code, external communication, or data leaks are evident. The obfuscation likely serves internal or placeholder purposes rather than malicious intent. The code's structure is standard for error handling modules, and the lack of dynamic or network activity indicates a benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of exception class definitions with superficial obfuscation, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the code is safe for use.",
