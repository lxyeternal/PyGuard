  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions and warnings related to HTTP request handling.\n- Many classes contain class attributes with obfuscated or random string names and values.\n- No data input, external network calls, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The inheritance structures are standard for custom exceptions.\n- No hardcoded credentials, malicious network activity, or backdoors are evident.\n- The obfuscated attribute names and values could be superficial or placeholders, not necessarily malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Focuses on class definitions for HTTP errors, with obfuscated attribute names.\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- Confidence: 0.9; Malware: 0; Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The reasoning aligns with the code: no malicious logic, just class definitions.\n- Obfuscation seems superficial.\n- The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Score suggestion:**\n\n- The scores seem reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1: class definitions with obfuscated attributes.\n- No data processing or external communication.\n- Confidence: 0.9; Malware: 0; Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Same as above, the analysis is consistent.\n- Obfuscated attribute names are likely placeholders or obfuscation, not malicious.\n\n**Score suggestion:**\n\n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Defines exception classes with random string attributes.\n- No suspicious activity or malicious code.\n- Confidence: 0.9; Malware: 0; Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior detected.\n- Obfuscation does not imply malicious intent here.\n\n**Score suggestion:**\n\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Similar pattern: custom exceptions with obfuscated attributes.\n- No malicious logic or external interactions.\n- Confidence: 0.9; Malware: 0; Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The analysis is consistent.\n- The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for internal reasons.\n\n**Score suggestion:**\n\n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Exception classes with obfuscated attribute names.\n- No malicious behavior or external communication.\n- Confidence: 0.8; Malware: 0; Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The slightly lower confidence and higher risk score reflect some uncertainty about obfuscation.\n- However, given the lack of evidence of malicious activity, these scores are still reasonable.\n\n**Score suggestion:**\n\n- The security risk could be lowered slightly to 0.1, aligning with other reports, unless further context suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily class definitions for error handling, with obfuscated attribute names.\n- No evidence of malware, malicious code, or security risks.\n- The obfuscation likely serves as superficial obfuscation or placeholder variables, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment and recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** High (around 0.7-0.8), which is consistent with the obfuscated attribute names.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0.1), as the code is purely structural with no active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.75 (reflecting the obfuscated attribute names)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (no active security threat, just obfuscated class definitions)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The superficial obfuscation does not constitute malicious intent. The code appears to be boilerplate exception class definitions for an HTTP client library, with obfuscated attribute names possibly for internal reasons or as placeholders.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Code is benign.**  \n- **Obfuscation is superficial.**  \n- **No malware or security risks detected.**  \n- **Scores should reflect high obfuscation but no malicious activity.**",
