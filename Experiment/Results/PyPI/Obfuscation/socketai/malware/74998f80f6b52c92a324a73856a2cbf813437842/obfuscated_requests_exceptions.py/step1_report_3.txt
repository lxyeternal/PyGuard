{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling HTTP and related errors in a requests-like library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for exceptions; class definitions with hardcoded string attributes.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data or system commands; no network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; mostly class inheritance and attribute assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of randomly named attributes with seemingly random strings; inheritance from various exception classes; no actual implementation logic or dynamic code execution; no suspicious API calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions, adding static attributes with random-looking string values. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. The attributes are unused within the class scope, serving no clear purpose, which may suggest obfuscation or placeholder code. There are no code injection, network activity, or malicious payloads observed. Overall, this appears to be standard exception class definitions with some seemingly obfuscated or placeholder attributes, lacking any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of exception class definitions with no active malicious behavior or security threats. The unusual attribute names and values do not indicate malicious intent but could be placeholders or obfuscation. There are no indicators of malware, data leaks, or malicious side effects. The code is safe.",
