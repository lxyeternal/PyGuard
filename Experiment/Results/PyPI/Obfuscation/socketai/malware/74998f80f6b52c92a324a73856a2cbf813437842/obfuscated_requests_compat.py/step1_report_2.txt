{
  "purpose": "This code sets up import handling and compatibility for various modules and data types, preparing environment compatibility and import fallback logic for dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as chardet/charset_normalizer, sys, simplejson/json, collections, http, io, and urllib, which are standard library or widely used third-party modules. No untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is evident; the code only imports modules and defines variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic imports and version checks but does not exhibit unusual or obfuscated code. It sets compatibility shims for Python 2 and 3, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code handles conditional imports for dependencies like chardet and simplejson, with fallbacks to standard libraries. It also manages Python version differences and defines basic data type aliases. There are no apparent data flows, external input handling, or suspicious constructs. The code is purely setup and compatibility boilerplate without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard setup code for environment compatibility and dependency management, with no malicious behavior or security risks observed. It appears benign and focused on establishing a compatible environment for further code execution.",
