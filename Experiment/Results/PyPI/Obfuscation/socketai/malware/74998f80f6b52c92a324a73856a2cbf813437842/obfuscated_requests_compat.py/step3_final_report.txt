{
  "purpose": "This code serves as environment setup for compatibility across Python versions, managing optional dependencies, and establishing type aliases for consistent behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'chardet'/'charset_normalizer', 'simplejson'/'json', standard library modules, and environment detection via 'sys.version_info'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "Imports and environment checks occur at the start; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code is purely setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard fallback mechanisms and version detection.",
  "analysis": "The code performs conditional imports for encoding detection libraries and JSON handling, checks Python version for compatibility, and defines type aliases. It contains no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The optional dependencies are benign and common in cross-version support. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is typical boilerplate for environment setup, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign setup boilerplate for environment compatibility and dependency management. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score should be 0, reflecting the code's safe nature.",
