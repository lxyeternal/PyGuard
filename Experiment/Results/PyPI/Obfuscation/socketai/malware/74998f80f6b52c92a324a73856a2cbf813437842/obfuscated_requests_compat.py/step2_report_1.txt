  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is standard setup for environment compatibility, dependency imports, and type aliasing.\n- No untrusted data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code employs common patterns like fallback imports and version checks.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n- The only potential concern is the import of character detection libraries (chardet/charset_normalizer), but these are standard libraries for encoding detection, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Standard imports, fallback mechanisms, environment detection, no suspicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup, dependency handling, no suspicious code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, compatibility, safe imports, no malicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar setup, no untrusted data processing, just imports and type aliases.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — Slightly higher, possibly due to the mention of character detection libraries, but these are standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — Very low, just noting potential minor concern.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly elevated but justified. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard compatibility code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — same reasoning as Report 4.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusions:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected. The code is purely environment setup.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Risk Scores:** Mostly 0, with minor elevations (0.1) justified by the presence of optional character detection libraries, which are benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justified Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** Given the code is purely setup with no data processing or external communication, a score of 0 or 0.1 is appropriate; I would set it at **0** for all reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is standard, benign setup code with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are reasonable, with minor justifications for the small security risk due to dependency choices, but overall, the security posture is very low risk.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code snippet.",
