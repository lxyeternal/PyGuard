  "sources": "Import statements and sys.version_info for environment detection.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks, primarily setting up environment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard imports with fallback mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports standard Python libraries and modules, with compatibility handling for different Python versions and optional simplejson import. No user input or untrusted data handling occurs here. No suspicious dynamic execution or hardcoded secrets are present. No network communication or data exfiltration logic is included. The code is structured to ensure compatibility across environments and Python versions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for a larger project, focusing on environment compatibility and standard library imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks within this snippet.",
