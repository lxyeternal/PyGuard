  "purpose": "Define metadata attributes for the 'requests' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static attribute assignments at the module level.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; static metadata only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward attribute assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns static string and numeric values to module-level variables that describe the package metadata, such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and some Unicode symbols. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external interactions, and no suspicious code structures. The attributes serve documentation and identification purposes. No malicious intent or malicious behavior is detectable from these assignments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely descriptive metadata for the package. There are no signs of malware, suspicious data flows, or security issues.",
