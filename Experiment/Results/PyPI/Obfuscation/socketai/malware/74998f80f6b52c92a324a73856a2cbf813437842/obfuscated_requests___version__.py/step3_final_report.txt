  "purpose": "Package metadata declaration including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, copyright, and decorative emojis.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignments with no dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Unicode emojis as decoration; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static metadata variables with no input handling, external data, or dynamic execution. Unicode emojis are harmless decorative elements. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these assessments. The JSON parse error in one report appears to be a formatting issue, not a code concern. Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and free of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static metadata declaration with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
