  "purpose": "Provides utilities for handling HTTP cookies, including cookie jar management, cookie creation, and request/response mock classes for cookie extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from request objects, response headers, cookie dictionaries, and morsel objects.",
  "sinks": "Modifies cookie jar states, creates cookies, and extracts headers. Potentially writes to cookie storage and manipulates cookies based on input.",
  "flows": "Input from request headers and morsels flows into cookie creation and extraction functions. Cookie data is stored and retrieved in cookie jar objects. Cookie creation functions process input data to generate cookie objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation detected. Use of mock classes is typical for testing. No evidence of data leakage or malicious network activity. The code appears standard for cookie handling and request mocking.",
  "analysis": "The code provides cookie handling utilities and mock classes for HTTP request/response simulation. Functions such as extract_cookies_to_jar, get_cookie_header, and cookiejar_from_dict are for managing cookies, which are common in HTTP client implementations. The classes MockRequest and MockResponse are for testing or internal use. The code does not perform network communication, data exfiltration, or system damage. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, well-structured cookie management library without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical cookie handling utility with mock classes for testing. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It functions as part of a larger HTTP client or testing framework. No evidence of malware or security threats was found.",
