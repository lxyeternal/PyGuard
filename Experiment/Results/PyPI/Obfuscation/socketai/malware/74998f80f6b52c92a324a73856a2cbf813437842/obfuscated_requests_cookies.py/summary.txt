  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard cookie management utility with mock classes for testing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor obfuscation indicated by a random attribute name does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this dependency is very low risk."
