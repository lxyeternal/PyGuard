{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for handling cookies and mock HTTP requests/responses, primarily for session management and cookie manipulation in HTTP client interactions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include HTTP request objects, response objects, and cookie dictionaries. These are read during cookie extraction, setting, deletion, and request header management.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include cookie setting (`set_cookie`), cookie header addition (`add_cookie_header`), and cookie removal (`remove_cookie_by_name`). These manipulate cookies and headers based on input data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as request headers, response headers, and cookie dictionaries into cookie creation, updating, and extraction functions. For example, cookie data from requests/responses flow into cookie jar objects, which can then be used to set headers or delete cookies.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain obvious malicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded credentials. It does include some redundant or unused variables, but nothing suspicious like network connections, data exfiltration, or covert channels.",
  "analysis": "The code implements cookie management and mock request/response objects with functions for extracting, setting, removing cookies, and converting between cookie representations. The functions perform standard operations for session and cookie handling without any network activity or system modifications. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is present. The overall structure aligns with typical cookie utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign cookie utility module with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It efficiently manages cookies and mock HTTP data for testing or application purposes. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
