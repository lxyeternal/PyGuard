{
  "purpose": "The code provides cookie management utilities, including mock request/response classes, cookie extraction, and storage functions, primarily for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading request headers, cookie attributes, and response headers",
  "sinks": "Cookie storage, header modifications, and cookie extraction functions",
  "flows": "Input request headers and cookie data flow into cookie storage and retrieval functions, with no network activity",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a suspiciously named attribute (`pjUizHvpmVUoMWwxeUJOKbQkeUcGcxKl`) in an exception class, which appears obfuscated but is likely benign",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of cookie utilities, including mock classes for testing, cookie creation, extraction, and management. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors are present. The suspicious attribute name is likely an obfuscation artifact or placeholder, not indicative of malicious intent. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The functions handle cookies securely within their scope, and no hardcoded credentials or unsafe practices are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard cookie management utility with mock classes for testing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor obfuscation indicated by a random attribute name does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this dependency is very low risk.",
