{
  "purpose": "Provides core functionality for preparing and handling HTTP requests and responses within the requests library, including request setup, response decoding, error handling, and link parsing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as method, url, headers, files, data, json, params, auth, cookies, hooks; response content, headers, status code, reason, raw data.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission of request data; response content decoding; error raising; connection release.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into request preparation; response data flows into decoding, error handling, and link parsing; errors may trigger exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected; standard implementation and usage.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard request and response handling functions typical of the requests library. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. Data flows are straightforward, with no suspicious sinks or source-to-sink pathways. The code uses well-established patterns for HTTP communication, error handling, and content decoding. No anomalies or unusual behaviors are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are consistent with the code's nature and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated content. It performs expected request/response operations without any security risks. The initial assessments are accurate; the overall supply chain security posture for this component is very low risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
