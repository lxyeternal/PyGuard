  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its functions, and the provided assessments.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes request preparation, including URL params, headers, files, JSON, data, auth, cookies, hooks, and response attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into network transmission, response decoding, error raising, and connection closing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code detected; standard library functions and mechanisms.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Confirms legitimate, standard code with high confidence; malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on request and response handling, including headers, content, and error management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flows; standard error handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard, benign code; malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no signs of malware or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes core classes/functions for HTTP request/response.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data from parameters flows into network and response processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behaviors or obfuscated code; standard implementation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, standard code; malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns; aligns with typical request handling code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar overview of request/response handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous data flows; straightforward processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard, benign code; malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes core request/response functions, including link parsing and error handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flows or dangerous actions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or code obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Normal, secure implementation; malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code Presence:** The code snippets are standard parts of the requests library, with no signs of malicious or suspicious code.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical flaws, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the benign nature, the risk scores are appropriately low (mostly 0.2 or 0), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, standard library code with no vulnerabilities)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe reports are consistent with the actual code behavior. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is a typical, legitimate part of the requests library, performing standard HTTP request/response handling.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the given assessments.**",
