  "purpose": "Implementation of a case-insensitive dictionary for HTTP headers, preserving last key case and enabling case-insensitive lookups.",
  "sources": "Code reading of class documentation and internal methods.",
  "sinks": "None; internal data management only.",
  "flows": "No external data flow; internal key-value handling.",
  "anomalies": "Mentions of undefined behavior when keys with identical lowercase forms are used during update or comparison.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility class implementing a case-insensitive dict for headers. It does not perform network operations, code injection, or data leaks. The mention of 'undefined behavior' is a typical caveat for such data structures, not an indicator of malicious activity. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature, acknowledging potential misuse in edge cases but not security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-understood implementation of a header management data structure with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The minor risk score reflects standard caveats rather than actual vulnerabilities.",
