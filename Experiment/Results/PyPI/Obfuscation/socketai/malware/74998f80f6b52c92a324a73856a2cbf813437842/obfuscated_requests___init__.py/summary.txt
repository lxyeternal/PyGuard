  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard dependency validation and environment setup routine. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The security risk is minimal, primarily associated with dependency version mismatches or outdated cryptography, which are routine concerns. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly zero; the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1)."
