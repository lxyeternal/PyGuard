      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command triggered conditionally during package setup. The tactics used are consistent with malware delivery or sabotage. The scores reflect a high threat level, and the package should be treated as malicious until further payload analysis confirms otherwise."
