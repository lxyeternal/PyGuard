{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package with metadata and potentially executes hidden PowerShell commands during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the filesystem to check for the existence of 'tahg'; executes a subprocess with a PowerShell command encoded in Base64.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes potentially malicious PowerShell code, which could lead to system compromise or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' existence -> If not found, runs encoded PowerShell command via subprocess, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess with 'Hidden' window style; no clear purpose for the command; silent exception handling masks failures; package setup metadata is obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing setup tools from distutils and attempts to import subprocess and os modules. It checks if a file/directory named 'tahg' exists. If not, it launches a subprocess running a PowerShell command encoded in Base64 with hidden window style, which could execute arbitrary code. The use of 'try-except' blocks suppresses errors, making detection harder. The setup function defines package metadata with a randomized name, possibly obfuscating intent. The encoded PowerShell command is suspicious, as it could contain malicious instructions. Overall, the script combines package setup with execution of hidden, potentially malicious PowerShell code, which indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by executing obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup, likely to perform unauthorized actions or compromise the system. The obfuscation and hidden execution strongly suggest malicious intent, despite the benign-looking package metadata.",
