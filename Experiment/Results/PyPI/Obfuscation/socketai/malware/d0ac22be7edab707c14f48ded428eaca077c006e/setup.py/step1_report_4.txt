{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be setting up a Python package and executing a PowerShell command, potentially as part of a supply chain process or installation script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem to check for the existence of 'tahg' and executes a subprocess running a PowerShell command encoded in base64.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executes the encoded PowerShell command, which is a potential sink if it performs malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg' existence -> If not found, runs a hidden PowerShell process with encoded commands.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded and executed without validation, and the purpose of the command is obscured. The use of subprocess with creation flags to hide the window suggests an attempt to conceal activity. The package setup information appears legitimate but is unrelated to the suspicious process.",
  "analysis": "The script first checks if a directory 'tahg' exists. If not, it runs a PowerShell command encoded in base64, hidden from the user. The encoded command likely performs some operation, possibly malicious, given its obfuscation and execution in a hidden window. The setup function specifies package metadata but is standard and unremarkable. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, which could hide malicious failures or misbehavior. The overall structure indicates an attempt to execute hidden, potentially malicious PowerShell code during installation or package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell execution that runs hidden, which is suspicious. It appears designed to perform an action covertly during package installation, which could be malicious depending on the content of the encoded command. The package setup code itself is benign but is likely a cover for malicious activity.",
