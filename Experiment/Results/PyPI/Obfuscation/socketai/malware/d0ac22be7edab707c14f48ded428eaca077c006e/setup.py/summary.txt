  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high likelihood of malicious activity due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and error suppression are typical of malicious scripts aiming to conceal payloads. Scores assigned across reports are consistent and justified. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious actions. Overall, the package should be treated as potentially malicious and flagged for further analysis."
