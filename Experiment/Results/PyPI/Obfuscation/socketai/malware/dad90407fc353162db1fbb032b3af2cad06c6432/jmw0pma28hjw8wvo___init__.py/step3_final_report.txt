  "analysis": "The code employs unsafe practices such as eval() and exec() with untrusted data, indicating high risk of malicious behavior. Obfuscation and hardcoded URLs further suggest malicious intent. The presence of dynamic code execution and suspicious network activity are typical indicators of supply chain sabotage or malware. No explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, but patterns strongly suggest potential malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to unsafe eval/exec usage, obfuscation, and network activity, indicating a significant security risk. While no direct payload is confirmed, patterns align with malicious or backdoored code, warranting caution.",
