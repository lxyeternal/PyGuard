  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to its stealthy, obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup, with indicators such as hidden process creation, broad error suppression, and obfuscation. The suspicious pattern warrants treating this as malicious until further payload analysis confirms benign intent."
