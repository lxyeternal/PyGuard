  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup, with error suppression masking potential failures. The behavior aligns with common malware tactics, and the high scores across malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified. Further decoding of the payload is recommended before deployment."
