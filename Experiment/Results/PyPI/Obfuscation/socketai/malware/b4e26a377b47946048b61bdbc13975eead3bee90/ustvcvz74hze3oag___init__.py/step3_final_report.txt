{
  "purpose": "The code performs data processing, possibly with network or file operations, but shows no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources, external network calls, environment variables (if any), file reads",
  "sinks": "Data transmission over network, file writes, environment variable access, system commands",
  "flows": "Input data → processing functions → network/file/system sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed; code appears straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing data processing with no network activity or obfuscation. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are detected. Confidence is high (0.8), malware score is 0, and risk score is 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero potential risk due to incomplete context. The flow from input sources through processing to sinks is typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating a low security risk and no malware presence.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
