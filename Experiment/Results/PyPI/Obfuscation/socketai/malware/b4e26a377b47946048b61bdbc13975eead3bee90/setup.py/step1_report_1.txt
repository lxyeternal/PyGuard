{
  "purpose": "To define and configure a minimal Python package setup with no dependencies.",
  "sources": "The 'setuptools' module import, the setup() function call with package name, version, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; setup configuration itself does not lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code imports a trusted library and calls a function with static arguments; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'ustvcvz74hze3oag' appears random and non-descriptive, which may indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools, with no user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution. The package name is unusual and non-descriptive, potentially hinting at malicious intent or obfuscation. However, the code itself only performs a standard package setup with no apparent malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple package setup script with an unusual package name. No malicious behavior is evident in the script itself, but the package name raises suspicion of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code does not include any malicious actions or suspicious logic beyond the unusual naming.",
