{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script ('setup.py') with embedded malicious activities, including network requests to suspicious IPs, downloading and executing remote payloads, privilege escalation checks, and file manipulations. It also contains obfuscated variable names and system modifications aimed at concealment and persistence.",
  "sources": "Reads version info, package data, environment variables; makes network requests to IP '52.14.229.35'; reads and writes files ('__version__.py', 'local_copy.txt', 'local_b.txt'); executes system commands via subprocess; checks for admin rights using 'net session'.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external IPs; writing files locally; executing downloaded files with shell=True; moving and deleting files; privilege escalation commands; dynamic installation of 'requests' module.",
  "flows": "Source: network requests and file reads; Sink: execution of remote files, privilege checks, file manipulations; Flow: download from IP -> write file -> execute via subprocess -> delete files -> privilege check -> potential remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP addresses ('52.14.229.35'), downloading and executing remote payloads, obfuscated variable names, dynamic dependency installation, use of shell=True in subprocess calls, privilege escalation attempts, and network activity from setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs suspicious network activity by connecting to external IPs, downloads files that are executed as batch scripts, and manipulates system files. It checks for administrative privileges, attempts privilege escalation, and cleans up traces. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, and the code uses subprocess with shell=True, increasing concealment. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious payloads embedded within legitimate setup routines. The code's structure and activities strongly suggest malicious intent, including remote code execution and system compromise vectors.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits embedded malicious behavior, including remote payload download and execution, privilege escalation, and system modifications. The obfuscation and network activity confirm high malicious intent. The overall security risk is severe, and the malware likelihood is very high.",
