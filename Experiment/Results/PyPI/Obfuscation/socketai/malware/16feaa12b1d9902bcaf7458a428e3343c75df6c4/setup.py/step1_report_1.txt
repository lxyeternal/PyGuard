{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with additional code that performs network requests and system modifications, potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "os, sys, requests, subprocess, files read such as '__version__.py' and 'README.md', environment variables, sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "Network requests to specific IP addresses, writing files ('local_copy.txt', 'local_b.txt'), executing system commands ('cmd /c ...'), moving and deleting files, potentially executing downloaded payloads",
  "flows": "Code reads version info and package data, then downloads external files from suspicious IPs, writes files locally, executes and deletes batch scripts, and attempts to escalate permissions via 'net session' command",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious network activity: connecting to IP '52.14.229.35' and downloading files; executing system commands to move, run, and delete files; attempting to check for administrative permissions; obfuscated and inconsistent variable naming; execution of external scripts without clear purpose",
  "analysis": "The script begins as a standard setup.py, but includes embedded malicious behavior: it downloads payloads from IP addresses, writes files with arbitrary names, executes potentially malicious batch scripts, and attempts privilege escalation using 'net session'. The network activity involves retrieving files that could be used to compromise or control the system. The use of subprocess calls to run commands and move files indicates possible code execution or persistence mechanisms. The code also detects if running with admin rights, which is typical for malicious activities that require higher privileges. The overall structure and embedded code strongly suggest malicious intent beyond normal package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains embedded malicious behavior including network communications with suspicious IPs, executing downloaded payloads, and privilege escalation attempts. This is not typical for a standard setup script and indicates probable malicious intent. The presence of hardcoded IP addresses, downloading and executing external files, and system modifications strongly suggest this is malicious code disguised as a setup script.",
