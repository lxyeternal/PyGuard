The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is very low. Further review of the full package is recommended if these anomalies are suspected to be obfuscation tactics."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscation primarily in naming. No evidence of malware, data leaks, or malicious behavior is present. The high obfuscation score (around 0.8) is justified, and the malware score remains at 0. The security risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting minimal threat. Overall, the code appears to be a set of internal exception and constant definitions with no security concerns."

      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated, with suspicious import aliasing and nonsensical identifiers, raising concerns about potential malicious intent or sabotage. While no explicit malicious activity is detected, the obfuscation warrants further deobfuscation and dynamic analysis before deployment. The overall assessment suggests a moderate to high risk primarily due to concealment tactics, and caution should be exercised."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, albeit heavily obfuscated, utility for cookie management in the requests library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the overall security risk remains low. The malware score could be slightly lowered to 0.1 to reflect the lack of direct malicious indicators, while the obfuscation score remains high (~0.75)."

However, no concrete evidence of malware or malicious activity is present within this snippet. The risk level is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and indirect data access patterns."

The overall security posture is moderate, primarily due to dynamic code execution and insecure deserialization functions. Scores are appropriate, with slight recommendations to lower malware scores where no active malicious activity is confirmed."
