  "security_risk": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits some risky practices that could be exploited but lacks evidence of active malicious payloads. The overall security posture is moderate, primarily due to dynamic code execution and insecure deserialization functions. Scores are appropriate, with slight recommendations to lower malware scores where no active malicious activity is confirmed."
