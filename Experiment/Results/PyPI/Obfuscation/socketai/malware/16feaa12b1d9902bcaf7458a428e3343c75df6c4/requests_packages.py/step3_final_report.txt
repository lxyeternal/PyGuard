  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables ('SECRET_KEY'), external files, network requests, system commands.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, network requests (requests.post), file operations, system commands, deserialization functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (network, files, system). Use of eval/exec and pickle.loads creates source-to-sink paths that can be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded 'SECRET_KEY', use of 'exec', insecure 'pickle.loads', dynamic eval/exec on untrusted data, obscure variable names, no validation or sanitization, no hardcoded secrets in some reports but risky practices present.",
  "analysis": "The code summaries indicate that reports 2 and 3 contain risky practices such as 'exec', 'pickle.loads', and eval/exec, which can be exploited maliciously. Report 2's use of hardcoded secrets and insecure deserialization are significant red flags. Reports 1 and 4 lack code, so no analysis is possible. Report 5 shows standard data processing with no malicious indicators. The scores assigned (malware, obfuscation, security risk) are generally consistent with the described behaviors, with minor adjustments suggested based on the presence of risky functions but no confirmed malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits some risky practices that could be exploited but lacks evidence of active malicious payloads. The overall security posture is moderate, primarily due to dynamic code execution and insecure deserialization functions. Scores are appropriate, with slight recommendations to lower malware scores where no active malicious activity is confirmed.",
