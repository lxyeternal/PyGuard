  "conclusion": "The code fragments contain no active code or malicious behavior. The embedded nonsensical strings suggest obfuscation or corruption but do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is very low. Further review of the full package is recommended if these anomalies are suspected to be obfuscation tactics."
