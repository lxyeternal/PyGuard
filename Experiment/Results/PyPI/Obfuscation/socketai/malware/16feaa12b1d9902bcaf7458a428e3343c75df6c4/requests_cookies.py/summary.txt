  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, albeit heavily obfuscated, utility for cookie management in the requests library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the overall security risk remains low. The malware score could be slightly lowered to 0.1 to reflect the lack of direct malicious indicators, while the obfuscation score remains high (~0.75)."
