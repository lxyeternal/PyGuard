{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with hardcoded string identifiers, possibly for error handling or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Class initializations and attribute assignments; hardcoded string values within class variables.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of obfuscated variable names and hardcoded string values; class inheritance from standard exceptions with no clear functional context; no apparent functional logic beyond class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions that inherit from standard Python exceptions and custom base classes. Many classes contain class variables with hardcoded string values. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, suggesting possible attempt at hiding intent or data. No functions process external data, and there are no network, file, or environment interactions. No cryptographic, injection, or data leakage patterns are present. The code does not perform any operations or logic beyond class and attribute declarations. Overall, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risk behavior in this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a set of obfuscated class definitions with hardcoded constants, likely for error handling or internal logic, but no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are detectable based on this snippet alone.",
