{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, some inheriting from standard Python exception classes and others from each other, with attributes that appear to be obfuscated strings.",
  "sources": "None of the classes or functions read input or data directly; no input sources or external data access points are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points; no untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks are observable, as the code mainly declares classes with static attributes and simple initializations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names and attribute names using seemingly random strings. The classes contain static string attributes with no apparent purpose related to security or functionality. The import statements import classes with obfuscated names, but no evidence of malicious code execution or data exfiltration. No dynamic code execution, eval, exec, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code predominantly consists of class definitions with obfuscated names and static string attributes. There are no evident input mechanisms, data processing, or output actions. Import statements bring in classes with obscure names, but they are from trusted modules, and no malicious behavior is apparent. The overall structure suggests obfuscation, but the content does not demonstrate malicious intent or malicious behavior. The presence of classes inheriting from standard exceptions and custom exceptions appears to be benign, likely for specialized error handling or internal use. No malicious code, backdoors, network activity, or data theft mechanisms are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be heavily obfuscated, possibly for concealment, but does not show any malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly defines classes with static attributes, without active code or data leaks. Overall, the likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
