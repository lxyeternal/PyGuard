  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, correlating the observations with the code and assessing the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines custom exception classes and constants, likely for error handling.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No external data reading or transmission.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated class and variable names; no malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** The code is mainly class definitions with static attributes. The only potentially sensitive part is the custom exception class handling response/request objects, but it doesn't process untrusted data or perform any malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or security risks detected. Obfuscation seems to be for internal naming rather than malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1, Obfuscated=0.7 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defines exception classes with obfuscated names and static string constants.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No data processing or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** Heavy obfuscation; static constants with no functional logic.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior. Obfuscation may be for concealment, but nothing suspicious is evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Likely benign, low security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.8 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Custom exception classes and constants, possibly for internal error handling.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated class and variable names; static constants.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; seems to serve as internal error definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** No security threat.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Obfuscated=0.8 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Exception classes with hardcoded string constants, obfuscated.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No external data or system interaction.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated naming; static string attributes.\n- **Analysis:** No active logic or data handling; appears to be for error handling or internal use.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1, Obfuscated=0.8 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Exception classes with obfuscated names and static strings, imported from known libraries but renamed.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No data processing or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** Heavy obfuscation; static attributes with nonsensical strings.\n- **Analysis:** Likely obfuscation for concealment, not malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1, Obfuscated=0.9 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign zero, and the code does not exhibit any malicious patterns such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** High, as expected, due to the intentionally obscure class and variable names.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, given the absence of active logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8 — obfuscation is prominent across all snippets.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — negligible security risk; mainly internal error handling with obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** The code appears to be obfuscated but benign. The obfuscation seems aimed at hiding internal details or making reverse engineering more difficult, rather than executing malicious activities.\n\nPlease let me know if further detailed static analysis or dynamic behavior testing is required.",
