  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines custom exception classes and constants with obfuscated names. No external data, no data flows, no network activity, no malicious behavior. Obfuscation appears limited to naming.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes the obfuscation and benign nature. The confidence scores (0.8 for security, 0.7 for obfuscated, malware 0) seem reasonable.\n\n- **Recommendation:** The malware score is correctly zero, and the overall risk is low. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with heavy obfuscation but no malicious activity. The classes are mostly static constants and exception subclasses.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The obfuscation is high (0.8), malware score is zero, and security risk is low.\n\n- **Recommendation:** The malware score remains appropriate at 0. The confidence levels are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Obfuscated class definitions, constants, no external data, no malicious behavior. The code appears to be part of internal error handling.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The obfuscation is high, but no malware or security risk.\n\n- **Recommendation:** The malware score should stay at 0. The overall assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Obfuscated exception classes with hardcoded string constants, no external data processing, no active logic.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The obfuscation is high, but no malicious activity.\n\n- **Recommendation:** Malware score remains 0. The security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Obfuscated class names, import statements from standard libraries with obfuscated names, no active logic, no data flows.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies the obfuscation and benign nature. No malware or security risk.\n\n- **Recommendation:** The malware score is appropriate at 0. The obfuscation is high but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are correctly set to 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** High (around 0.8-0.9), justified by the naming conventions.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (around 0.1-0.2), consistent with the lack of active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Estimation\n\nGiven the detailed analysis:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8-0.9, as per the reports, justified by the naming.\n- **Risk:** 0.1-0.2, reflecting the benign nature but acknowledging obfuscation.\n\n**In conclusion,** the reports are consistent with the code's content. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores are appropriate.\n\n**No adjustments necessary.**",
