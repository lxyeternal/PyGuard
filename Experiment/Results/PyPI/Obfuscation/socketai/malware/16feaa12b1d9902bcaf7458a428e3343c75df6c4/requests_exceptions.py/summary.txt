  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscation primarily in naming. No evidence of malware, data leaks, or malicious behavior is present. The high obfuscation score (around 0.8) is justified, and the malware score remains at 0. The security risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting minimal threat. Overall, the code appears to be a set of internal exception and constant definitions with no security concerns."
