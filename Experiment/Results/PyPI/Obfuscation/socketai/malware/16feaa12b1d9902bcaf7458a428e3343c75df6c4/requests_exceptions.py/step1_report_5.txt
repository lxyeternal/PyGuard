{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with obfuscated class names, inheriting from standard exceptions and possibly other imported classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and a local compat module; class attribute assignments; class definitions with hardcoded string attributes.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks; no data processing, I/O, network, or external data usage observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are only defined with static attributes and inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of obfuscated class names and variable names; attributes assigned with long, nonsensical strings; no meaningful logic or data handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes with obfuscated names, inheriting from standard Python exceptions and imported exception classes. Some classes set static string attributes that appear arbitrary. The initial imports are from well-known libraries but are given obfuscated names. No dynamic execution, input handling, or external communication is evident. The purpose seems to be obfuscation rather than functional logic, and no malicious activities such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system modification are visible. The code may serve to confuse or hide malicious intent but on its own does not contain active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily consists of obfuscated class definitions and static string attributes with no active logic, data handling, or external interactions. No evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks detected. The obfuscation appears to be intended to hide true purpose but without additional context, it appears benign.",
