  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines custom exceptions and constants, with no external input or untrusted data, no data leaks, flows, or suspicious activity. Obfuscation appears limited to naming conventions.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is mainly class definitions with static attributes and obscure names. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. The obfuscation seems superficial.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.7, Confidence = 0.8 — reasonable. The low risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with obfuscated class names and static constants, no evidence of malicious activity, data leaks, or active code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The heavy obfuscation is noted, but the code appears benign. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.8 — consistent with the reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Obfuscated class definitions with constants, no data processing, no external data, no malicious behavior. The code seems to serve internal error handling.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent. Obfuscation likely for concealment, but benign.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.8 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Obfuscated class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions, static string constants, no data handling or external interaction.\n\n- **Assessment:** No active malicious behavior. Obfuscation may be for hiding intent, but no evidence of malware.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.8 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern: obfuscated class names, static constants, no active logic or external data processing. Possibly for error handling or internal use.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity. Obfuscation seems superficial.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.9 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe code that is heavily obfuscated, primarily through nonsensical class and variable names, with static string constants. No dynamic code, network activity, data exfiltration, or active logic.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** None of the reports find evidence of malicious behavior. The malware scores are all at 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** High across all reports, justified by the nonsensical naming conventions.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Low, reflecting the absence of active malicious behavior but acknowledging obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.8 — consistent with heavy obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal security risk, mainly due to obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThe code appears to be a set of obfuscated exception and constant class definitions, likely intended to hinder readability or conceal purpose. There is no evidence of malware, data leaks, or malicious activity. The obfuscation is superficial, not involving dynamic or malicious techniques.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No security threat detected; the obfuscation seems intentional but benign.",
