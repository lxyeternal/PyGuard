{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes and static constants, likely for internal error handling or obfuscation purposes, with no external input or active logic.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and static string attributes; no external data input or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, external transmissions, or external system interactions detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network/system operations.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation through nonsensical class and variable names; static constants with no functional logic; import statements with obfuscated names.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of class definitions with static string constants and inheritance from standard exceptions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. Obfuscation appears superficial, primarily in naming conventions, likely for concealment rather than malicious intent. The absence of data processing, external communication, or malicious payloads indicates benign behavior. The obfuscation could be used to hinder readability but does not inherently imply malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscation primarily in naming. No evidence of malware, data leaks, or malicious behavior is present. The high obfuscation score (around 0.8) is justified, and the malware score remains at 0. The security risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting minimal threat. Overall, the code appears to be a set of internal exception and constant definitions with no security concerns.",
