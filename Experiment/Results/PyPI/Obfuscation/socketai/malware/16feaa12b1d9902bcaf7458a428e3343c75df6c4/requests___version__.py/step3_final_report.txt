  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network/file operations, potential data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code in report 5; no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports describe benign, straightforward code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the benign assessments. Security risk scores are low (0.2) for reports with code, reflecting minimal threat; report 5's lack of code justifies a risk of 0. Confidence levels are high (0.7-0.9) for code-present reports, indicating strong certainty, and low (0.3) for the empty code, reflecting uncertainty. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified across the reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating low security risk. No evidence suggests malicious activity or significant vulnerabilities. The assessments are appropriate and require no adjustments.",
