  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the absence of code content; it appears to be an empty or placeholder script.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are evident in the provided code fragment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are observable due to lack of code activity.",
  "anomalies": "The code is completely absent or empty, which is unusual for a functional script. There are no visible operations, imports, or logic that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains no executable statements, data processing, or external interactions. This could indicate an incomplete snippet, an intentionally empty script, or a placeholder. Without actual code, there are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors detectable.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The empty or missing code might be an issue of completeness rather than malicious intent.",
