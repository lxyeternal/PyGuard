  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended to perform data processing or similar operations.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, configuration files, or user input functions (e.g., input(), sys.stdin).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or security issues could occur at network communication functions (e.g., socket, requests), file write operations, or subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (environment variables, user input) flows into processing functions, then possibly into network or file output functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious domain names, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads input from standard sources but does not show evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or backdoors. It uses common libraries without suspicious patterns. There are no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated segments. The overall structure is straightforward and typical for legitimate scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no indications of malware or supply chain attacks.",
