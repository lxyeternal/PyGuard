{
  "purpose": "This code performs environment detection, conditional imports, and variable assignments with obfuscation, serving as setup or compatibility code without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.version_info, environment flags, and module import fallbacks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Source: environment detection and import statements → No malicious or data-exfiltration paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and redundant assignments suggest superficial obfuscation, not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily environment setup with fallback imports and obfuscated variable names. No network, file, or data exfiltration code is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for code protection or analysis hindrance. No suspicious data flows or malicious patterns are evident. The code's benign nature is consistent with the lack of malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as environment compatibility/setup code with superficial obfuscation. No signs of malware or security risks are present. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated≈0.75, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
