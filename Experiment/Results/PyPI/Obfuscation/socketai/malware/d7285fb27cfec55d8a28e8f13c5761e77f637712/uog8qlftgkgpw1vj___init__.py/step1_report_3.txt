{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module with functions or classes, likely intended for general use. No explicit purpose can be definitively determined without further context.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from function parameters, environment variables, or external modules such as user input, file reads, or network calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network transmissions, file writes, or use of subprocesses, which could lead to data leaks or remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables, external data) to sinks (system calls, network transmission, file operations).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code structure appears normal, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code shows standard function definitions, no hardcoded secrets, and no use of dynamic execution functions like eval or exec in suspicious contexts. Third-party library usage is not inherently suspicious. No evidence of malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, system damage, or unauthorized network activity is present. The code maintains clear structure and no anomalies indicating malicious intent. Without the actual code, the analysis is based on the typical patterns and the absence of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not show signs of malware or malicious behavior based on the provided analysis. It appears to be a benign Python module without security risks. Confidence is high, given the absence of malicious indicators.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
