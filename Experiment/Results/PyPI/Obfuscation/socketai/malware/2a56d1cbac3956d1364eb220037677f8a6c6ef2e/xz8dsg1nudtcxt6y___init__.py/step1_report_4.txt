{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a collection of utility classes and functions for console manipulation, terminal display, and simple UI elements such as banners, loading indicators, and text formatting, likely intended for developing command-line interfaces or visual effects.",
  "sources": "Input reading from input() functions, terminal size queries (_terminal_size), environment detection (os.name), and external system commands via _system().",
  "sinks": "System commands (_system), console cursor control (GetConsoleCursorInfo, SetConsoleCursorInfo), and console output (_stdout.write, _stdout.flush).",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input and environment info into system commands or display functions; user input may influence flow control; terminal manipulation commands affect system display but do not transfer data externally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class and function names, dynamic generation of display elements with no clear purpose, excessive complexity in rendering functions, and no evident malicious intent such as network activity, data theft, or system damage. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network calls are present. The code heavily relies on console manipulation but not in a malicious way.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility classes for terminal control, text formatting, animated display, and layout rendering, with functions for hiding/showing cursor, creating banners, animated text effects, and alignment. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system damage. It appears to be designed for UI/UX enhancement in CLI applications. Obfuscation is mostly in naming conventions, which may be a developer choice or attempt to hide intent, but the core functions do not perform malicious actions. No embedded or runtime code execution of external code or suspicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated utility suite for CLI UI effects and terminal manipulation. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation appears superficial and intended to hinder readability rather than conceal malicious activity.",
