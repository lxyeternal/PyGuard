  "conclusion": "The script contains suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell execution during setup, with high potential for malicious activity. The high obfuscation and stealth tactics justify elevated malware and risk scores. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious payloads, but current indicators suggest a significant security threat."
