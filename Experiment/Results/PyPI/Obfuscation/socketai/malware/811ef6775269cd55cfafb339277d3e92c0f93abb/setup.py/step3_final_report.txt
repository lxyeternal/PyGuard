{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain, likely for malicious tracking or data theft.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with external URL 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' and parameters containing system info",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) → parameters in requests.get() → external request to exye.io",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, network request during setup, data sent to a known Ceye.io domain, no user notification or consent",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during execution, gathers hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data covertly to an external server. Obfuscation and network activity during installation are suspicious. The data exfiltration indicates malicious intent, such as privacy invasion or tracking. The use of a Ceye.io domain, often associated with testing or command-and-control channels, further supports malicious suspicion. The behavior aligns with covert data theft rather than benign functionality. The obfuscation and external communication during setup are red flags. The scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate; however, given the covert data exfiltration, malware and risk scores should be adjusted upward to reflect high malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to covert data exfiltration during installation, obfuscation, and communication with suspicious domains. The behavior warrants a high malware score (around 0.8-0.9) and a high security risk score (around 0.8-0.9). Some reports underestimate the maliciousness, particularly in malware scoring, which should be increased to better reflect the severity. Overall, this package poses a significant security threat and should be flagged for further review or removal.",
