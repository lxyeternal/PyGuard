  "purpose": "Define a custom setup command that collects system information and sends it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), requests.get() with system info as parameters",

  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, unusual use of requests during setup, no user consent, potential privacy violation, sending data to a suspicious domain",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, when invoked during package setup, collects system information such as hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded domain ('http://5r13v9.ceye.io'), which appears suspicious. The use of obfuscated class and variable names suggests an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The information collection occurs automatically during package installation without user knowledge or consent, indicating potential privacy invasion. The remote server could be used for tracking or malicious purposes. No other malicious payloads or backdoors are present beyond data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code attempts to silently collect system information during package installation and send it to a suspicious external server. This behavior indicates malicious intent related to privacy invasion and potential data exfiltration. The obfuscation and unsolicited data transmission are warning signs. Overall, the code poses a security risk due to its covert data collection activity.",
