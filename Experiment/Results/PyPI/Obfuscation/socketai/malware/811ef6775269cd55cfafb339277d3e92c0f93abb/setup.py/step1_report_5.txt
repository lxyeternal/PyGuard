{
  "purpose": "Define a custom installation command that gathers system information and sends it to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with system info as URL parameters",
  "flows": "During package setup, the custom install class executes, collects system info, and sends it via HTTP GET request to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; unconventional code structure; information is transmitted without user consent or obvious necessity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools' install command with intentionally obfuscated names. In the overridden method, it collects hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data to an external server via a GET request. The code executes during package installation, potentially without user awareness. The external request could be used for tracking or exfiltration. No malicious payload such as code execution, data theft, or backdoors is present, but the data exfiltration behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious depending on user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious-like behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to an external server during installation without user consent. It appears to be designed for tracking or data collection, which poses security and privacy concerns.",
