  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to covert data exfiltration during installation, obfuscation, and communication with suspicious domains. The behavior warrants a high malware score (around 0.8-0.9) and a high security risk score (around 0.8-0.9). Some reports underestimate the maliciousness, particularly in malware scoring, which should be increased to better reflect the severity. Overall, this package poses a significant security threat and should be flagged for further review or removal."
