{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to set up a Python package and extend the installation process to perform additional actions during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser())",
  "sinks": "The code sends an HTTP GET request to 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' with collected system information as URL parameters",
  "flows": "The data collected from system info sources flows into the requests.get call as URL parameters, potentially transmitting system details to an external server during package installation",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code structure: variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical; the class and method names are random and meaningless; the code performs an external network request during package installation, which is suspicious behavior. The URL used is a known Ceye.io domain often used for DNS or HTTP callback tracking, indicating possible data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that inherits from setuptools.command.install. During the install process, it collects system information (hostname, current directory, username) and sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a remote server. The code's obfuscated variable and class names hinder readability, suggesting an attempt to hide malicious intent. Sending system info during installation without user consent could be used for tracking or malicious surveillance. The external request to an obscure domain raises suspicion of potential data exfiltration or backdoor activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by transmitting system information to an external server during package installation. The obfuscated variable names and the timing of the network request further support the likelihood of malicious intent. This behavior can be used for tracking, surveillance, or data theft without user knowledge.",
