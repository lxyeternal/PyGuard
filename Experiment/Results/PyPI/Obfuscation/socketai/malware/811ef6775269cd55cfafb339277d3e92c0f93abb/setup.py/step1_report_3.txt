{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup command that, during installation, collects system information and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, current working directory, and username from system calls and environment.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected system data to external server ('http://5r13v9.ceye.io') using requests.get.",
  "flows": "Data collected from system info sources flows into the HTTP request parameters, resulting in data exfiltration to an external domain during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; unconventional code structure; performs network activity during installation. No explicit credentials or malicious code like backdoors are present, but the data exfiltration behavior is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines a custom installation class. During installation, it gathers hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this info to an external server. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide intent. The network request occurs during setup, which is unusual and potentially malicious, indicating possible data collection or spying behavior. No malicious payload like malware or backdoors is evident, but the action itself is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This package performs system information exfiltration during installation by sending data to an external server. The obfuscation and behavior raise security concerns, suggesting possible malicious intent or privacy invasion. It warrants caution before use.",
