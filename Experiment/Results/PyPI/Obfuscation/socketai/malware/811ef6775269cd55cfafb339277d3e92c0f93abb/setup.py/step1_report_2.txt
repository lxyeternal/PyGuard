{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools, with a custom installation step that collects system information and sends it via an HTTP GET request.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() - these functions read system hostname, current working directory, and username respectively.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() - sends collected system data to an external server at 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io'.",
  "flows": "Data collected from sources (hostname, cwd, username) flows directly into the request parameters, which are then sent to an external server through requests.get().",
  "anomalies": "The code secretly collects system information during package installation and transmits it without user consent or notification. The domain 'ceye.io' is known for use in security testing and C2 channels, raising suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the setup process by subclassing the install command, adding behavior that gathers hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data to an external server. This behavior occurs silently during installation, which is suspicious. The external domain used is associated with testing or command-and-control activities. No explicit user consent is given, and the code appears to be covertly exfiltrating system information, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by covertly collecting and exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent. It uses obscure class and method names, likely to evade detection. The external server domain is suspicious. Overall, this code poses a security risk.",
