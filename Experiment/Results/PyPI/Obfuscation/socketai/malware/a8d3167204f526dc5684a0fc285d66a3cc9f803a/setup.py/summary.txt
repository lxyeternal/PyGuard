  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear, active backdoor that executes arbitrary commands, uploads files, and communicates with an external server during package installation. It is malicious, with high security risk, and no obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1, securityRisk: 1, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
