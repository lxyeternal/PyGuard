      "conclusion": "The code contains a clear, active backdoor that executes arbitrary commands, uploads files, and communicates with an external server during package installation. It is malicious, with high security risk, and no obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1, securityRisk: 1, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."

      "conclusion": "The existing reports are consistent with their observations and scoring. Minor adjustment of Report 3's malware score from 0.2 to 0.1 enhances accuracy. The overall assessment indicates low to moderate risk, with some reports showing obfuscation and suspicious activity. No major revisions are necessary; the evaluations are justified based on the described behaviors."
