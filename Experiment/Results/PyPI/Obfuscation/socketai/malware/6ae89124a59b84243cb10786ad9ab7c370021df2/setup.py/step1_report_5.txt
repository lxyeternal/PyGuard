{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package using setuptools, but it includes malicious behavior that downloads and executes external code during installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and external URLs (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php and https://python-release.com/python-install.scr)",
  "sinks": "Writing a file 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe' and executing it via os.system('start ...') during installation",
  "flows": "Retrieves 'COMPUTERNAME' -> Sends it to a remote server -> Downloads a payload from a suspicious URL -> Saves payload as an executable -> Runs the executable",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated function and variable names; external URL downloads during setup; execution of downloaded file without validation; use of broad exception handling suppressing errors; malicious network activity during package installation",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and other modules, then defines a function that attempts to read the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable. It sends this information to a remote server, then conditionally downloads and executes an external script if on Windows. The setup function registers a custom installation class that runs this function during package installation. This pattern indicates an attempt to infect or surveil the system during package setup, which is malicious behavior. The code hides intentions with obfuscated names and suppresses errors, which complicates detection. Overall, this code actively downloads and executes external malicious payloads during setup.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior—specifically, it contacts remote servers, downloads an executable, and runs it during installation—indicating high malicious intent. It appears designed to compromise or surveil systems where installed, and should be considered unsafe.",
