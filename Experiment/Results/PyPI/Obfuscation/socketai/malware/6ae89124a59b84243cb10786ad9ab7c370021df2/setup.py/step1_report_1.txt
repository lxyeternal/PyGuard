{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for a Python package, including a custom installation step that performs malicious network requests and potentially harmful file execution during package installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation ', URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', and the executable 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe'",
  "sinks": "Requests to external domains, writing and executing a downloaded file via 'os.system'",
  "flows": "The code reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> Sends data to linkedopports.com -> Downloads and executes remote script or executable -> Potential remote control or malicious activity",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated class and function names, downloads and executes an external file, and communicates with suspicious domains. The exception handling suppresses errors silently, hiding possible issues. The network activity during package installation is suspicious and non-standard.",
  "analysis": "The script includes a malicious function 'BEoTDxTxzaGOGVXdXixYPhYNKSYGQDrN' that retrieves an environment variable, contacts an external URL with that data, and conditionally downloads and executes a potentially malicious file when run on Windows. The setup class 'WpzuuerUeAXEGKDhWJWeZMtBvZfxlatW' extends the install command to invoke this malicious function during installation. The obfuscated naming and network activity within a package setup indicate malicious intent. The code attempts to perform remote code execution, which could compromise the system upon package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code designed to exfiltrate system information and download/execute potentially harmful files during installation. Its obfuscated names and network behavior strongly suggest malicious intent. It should not be used.",
