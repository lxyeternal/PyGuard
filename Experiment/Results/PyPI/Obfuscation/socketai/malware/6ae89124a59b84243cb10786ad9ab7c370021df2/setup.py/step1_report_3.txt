{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package with additional behavior triggered during installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', network requests to specific URLs, and downloading a file during installation.",
  "sinks": "Writing to a file, executing a downloaded file via os.system, and making network requests that could potentially leak data or execute malicious code.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is used to construct a URL which is fetched; if on Windows, another URL is fetched, saved to a file, and executed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, network requests to suspicious URLs, downloading and executing an external file during install, silent exception handling, and no documentation or comments.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to an external server. On Windows systems, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it silently. The custom install class overrides the install command to invoke this function during package installation, potentially installing malicious software without user consent or knowledge. The obfuscated naming and network activity during setup are suspicious, indicating possible malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear signs of malicious behavior: downloading and executing external files during installation, obfuscated code elements, and network communication with suspicious URLs. These activities strongly suggest the code is intended to perform malicious actions during package installation, constituting a high security risk.",
