{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform malicious activities during package installation, including exfiltrating system information, downloading, and executing external payloads, all while obfuscating its intent.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; makes network requests to suspicious URLs; downloads and executes a payload file.",
  "sinks": "Sending data to external servers; executing downloaded payloads via os.system.",
  "flows": "Source (environment variable and network requests) -> sink (payload download and execution).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names; silent exception handling; downloading and executing external files during setup; network activity to suspicious domains.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that exfiltrates system info and downloads a payload when run on Windows. It is invoked during package installation via a custom install class. The code uses obfuscated identifiers, suppresses errors silently, and performs actions that can compromise system security. All indicators point to malicious intent, including remote code execution, data exfiltration, and obfuscation. The network activity and payload execution during setup are highly suspicious and typical of supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior, including remote payload delivery and system compromise mechanisms. It is highly malicious with a high security risk, warranting a malware score of 1, an obfuscation score of 0.8, and a security risk score of 1.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
