{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, but also includes hidden malicious behavior that executes code from external sources during installation.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and external URLs used within the BEoTDxTxzaGOGVXdXixYPhYNKSYGQDrN() function.",
  "sinks": "Writing a downloaded file to disk and executing it via os.system, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent in a GET request; depending on platform, it downloads and executes a file from a suspicious URL during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated function and variable names, hidden network communication, downloading and executing remote code during package installation, no visible legitimate purpose for these actions.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup for a package with minimal legitimate setup parameters. It includes a function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and makes a GET request to a remote URL, then, if on Windows, downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it silently. This behavior is hidden inside an install class method that is invoked during package installation, indicating malicious intent to run remote code without user awareness. The URLs used are suspicious and do not align with legitimate package operations. The obfuscated variable and function names further suggest malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to execute arbitrary code from external servers during installation, constituting a malicious supply chain attack.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains hidden malicious behavior that downloads and executes external code during package installation, with obfuscated variable names and network activity indicating malicious intent. It poses a high security risk.",
