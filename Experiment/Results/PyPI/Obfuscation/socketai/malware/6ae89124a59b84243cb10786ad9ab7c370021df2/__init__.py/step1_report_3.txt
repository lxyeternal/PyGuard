{
  "purpose": "The code defines and calls a function that prints a message indicating installation.",
  "sources": "The function call at the end of the script reads no external input; the only data source is the code itself.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to standard output via print, which is not a security sink; no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "The script executes the function, which then prints a static message; no data flow from untrusted sources exists.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated and nonsensical; no meaningful purpose or logic beyond printing a message. No external data, secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a function with an obfuscated name that prints a static message 'installed'. The function is invoked immediately after definition. There are no inputs, no external calls, no data leaks, and no malicious actions. The obfuscated function name might suggest an attempt to hide intent, but the actual code performs a benign action.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign script that prints a message indicating installation status. There is no malicious behavior, no data exfiltration, and no security issues detected.",
