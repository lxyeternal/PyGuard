{
  "purpose": "A simple function that prints 'installed' to indicate installation or presence.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; the code does not read data from files, network, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only performs a print statement, which is benign.",
  "flows": "The function is called immediately after definition, with no data flow or external data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is obfuscated and nonsensical, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal function with an obfuscated name that outputs a static message. There are no external data inputs, network activity, or system modifications. The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide intent, but in this context, it appears to be benign. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with the main concern being the obfuscated name. The malware score is justified as 0, given the lack of malicious behavior. The obfuscated score is moderate (~0.75), reflecting the nonsensical name. The security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), mainly due to obfuscation but no actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder or indicator with obfuscated naming. No malicious activity or data leaks are present. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and the code's behavior is harmless.",
