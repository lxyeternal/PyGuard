  "purpose": "The code attempts to set up a Python package and executes a hidden PowerShell command if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('tahg') check; subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command with hidden window",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist -> execute PowerShell command in background",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command; running subprocess with no window; broad exception handling",
  "analysis": "The script begins with importing setup from distutils and then tries to check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg'. If it does not exist, it executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with hidden window style, using an encoded command string. This command could potentially be malicious as it is encoded and executed without validation. The setup function is called to define package metadata, which is benign. The broad except blocks suppress errors, preventing visibility into failures. The use of encoded PowerShell commands and background execution are suspicious behaviors indicative of potential malicious activity, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell execution with encoded content, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. It may be designed to run malicious commands silently in the background, indicating a high security risk. The setup portion appears benign, but the hidden command execution is concerning.",
