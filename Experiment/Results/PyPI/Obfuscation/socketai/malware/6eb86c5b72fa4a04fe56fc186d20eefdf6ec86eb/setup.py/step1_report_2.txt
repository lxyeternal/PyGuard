  "anomalies": "Cloning a remote repository into startup folder, renaming a file in startup directory, hiding this behavior within a setup script, using obfuscated class and method names",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that sets an environment variable, clones a remote Git repository into the Windows startup folder, and moves a file named 'test.py' into that folder, potentially to execute on startup. The repository URL is hardcoded and suspicious, and the directory paths are obfuscated. The code's purpose appears to be to persist malicious code on the victim system via startup execution. Use of non-standard class and method names suggests obfuscation. The setup dependencies include popular libraries, which do not raise suspicion, but the main behavior indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to clandestinely clone a potentially malicious repository into the system's startup folder and move a script there, likely to execute malicious code automatically. This behavior indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, as it attempts persistence and potentially executing malicious payloads at startup.",
