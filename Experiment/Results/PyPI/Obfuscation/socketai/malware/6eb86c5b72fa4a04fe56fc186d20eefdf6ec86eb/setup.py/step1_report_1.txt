{
  "purpose": "Customize installation process to clone a GitHub repository and move files into the startup folder, potentially to execute malicious code on startup.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.getlogin()), lists directories, and reads files within the startup directory.",
  "sinks": "Cloning a repository into startup, renaming and moving test.py into startup directory, which could execute malicious scripts on startup.",
  "flows": "During installation, retrieves login info -> clones malicious repo -> moves script into startup folder, potentially executing code on user login.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of environment variables and filesystem manipulation to position a script in startup folder; obfuscated class name and method; cloning from a suspicious GitHub URL; moving a script into startup without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that sets an environment variable related to 'git', then clones a remote repository from 'https://github.com/dcsage/test2lmaos.git' into a startup directory. It then renames 'test.py' from the cloned directory into the Windows startup folder, likely to execute malicious code at user login. The obfuscation of class and method names suggests intent to conceal behavior. The code leverages standard libraries but performs actions indicative of persistence and potential malware delivery.",
  "conclusion": "This package includes malicious behavior: it clones a remote repository, manipulates startup files, and potentially executes malicious scripts without user consent. The obfuscated class and method names further suggest malicious intent. Overall, the package poses a high security risk.",
