  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by cloning a remote repository into the startup folder and moving scripts there for persistence, combined with obfuscation to conceal intent. The behavior is consistent with malware tactics, posing a severe security threat. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified and should be maintained. The package should be considered malicious and avoided."
