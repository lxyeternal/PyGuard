  "purpose": "The code is designed to execute custom installation procedures during package setup, including cloning a Git repository and moving files into startup folder locations on Windows.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.listdir(), git.Git().clone()",
  "sinks": "os.makedirs(), os.rename(), file system modifications, cloning remote Git repository",
  "flows": "Get login info -> Create directories -> Clone remote repo -> List directory -> Move/rename files",
  "anomalies": "Cloning a Git repository into startup directory; renaming files within startup folder; hardcoded Git URL; creating potentially persistent auto-start entries",
  "analysis": "The code leverages setuptools to define a custom install class that, upon execution, sets an environment variable, then clones a remote Git repository into a startup directory. It then renames a file within that directory, potentially to ensure persistence or execute malicious payloads. The use of hardcoded paths involving user directories and a remote Git URL indicates an attempt to persist or execute malicious code on startup. These behaviors strongly resemble malware tactics like persistence and remote code execution setup. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution techniques are present outside standard library usage. The remote URL is suspicious and may host malicious content. The code acts as a backdoor or persistence mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior by establishing persistence through startup folder modification, cloning a remote repository, and renaming files in a way that suggests intent to execute malicious code at system startup. It is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
