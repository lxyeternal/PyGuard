  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to clone a GitHub repository and move a script into the Windows startup folder, likely for persistence.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.environ, os.listdir(), git.Git().clone()",
  "sinks": "os.makedirs(), os.rename(), cloning a repository, creating files in startup folder",
  "flows": "os.getlogin() -> constructing paths -> cloning repo -> moving test.py to startup directory",
  "anomalies": "Cloning external repository during installation, moving scripts into startup folder, executing persistent setup, obfuscated class and method names, presence of malicious directory paths, no visible user interaction",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon execution, sets an environment variable, clones a potentially malicious GitHub repository, and moves a script 'test.py' into the Windows startup folder to establish persistence. The use of obfuscated class and method names suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. Cloning from an external source and placing files in startup directories are common persistence techniques. The code does not perform any user prompts, logging, or encryption but actively manipulates system startup configurations and downloads external code, which are suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to intentionally establish persistence by downloading and moving scripts into startup directories, indicating malicious intent. The obfuscation and behavior strongly suggest malicious activity designed to persist or execute malicious code on the host system.",
