      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates behaviors consistent with supply chain malware, including stealthy, obfuscated command execution during package setup. While the exact payload remains unknown, the techniques used strongly suggest malicious intent. The high obfuscation and stealth scores are justified, and the overall security risk is significant. This package should be treated as malicious until further analysis confirms the payload's nature."
