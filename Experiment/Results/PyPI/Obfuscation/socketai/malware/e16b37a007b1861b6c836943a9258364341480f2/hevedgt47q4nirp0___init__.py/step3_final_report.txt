  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code analysis, data flows, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input data reading points, environment variables, external dependencies, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Data leaks, network transmissions, system modifications, sensitive information access.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks, such as untrusted input flowing into network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious data handling, obfuscated code, unusual control flow, incomplete documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. No external dependencies or suspicious data flows are detected. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is low. Slight caution in ambiguous cases (e.g., incomplete info) results in marginally higher risk scores, but overall, the code is benign. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. Security risks are minimal, and the likelihood of malicious intent is negligible. Scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
