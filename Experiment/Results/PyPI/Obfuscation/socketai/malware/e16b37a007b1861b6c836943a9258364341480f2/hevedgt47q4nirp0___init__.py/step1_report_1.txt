  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be the implementation of a Python package, potentially providing utility functions or features for users.",
  "sources": "Data is read from standard input, environment variables, and possibly external modules or network connections (if present in the code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writing, subprocess execution, or data transmission that could leak data or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like input or environment variables into functions or modules that may process or transmit data, potentially reaching sinks such as network or file systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features observed. No hidden code or dynamic execution identified.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed comprehensively, including its structure and content. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or code injection techniques were observed. Usage of third-party libraries is typical and not suspicious. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code were found. The code's flow appears typical for a utility package, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security threats. It appears to be a benign utility package with no malicious code or security risks detected.",
