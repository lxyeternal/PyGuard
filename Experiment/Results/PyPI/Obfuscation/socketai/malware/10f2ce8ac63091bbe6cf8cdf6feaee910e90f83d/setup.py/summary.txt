  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup. The pattern suggests malicious intent, possibly a backdoor or payload downloader. While the payload content is unknown, the obfuscation and silent execution justify high malware and risk scores. Further decoding of the base64 payload is recommended for confirmation."
