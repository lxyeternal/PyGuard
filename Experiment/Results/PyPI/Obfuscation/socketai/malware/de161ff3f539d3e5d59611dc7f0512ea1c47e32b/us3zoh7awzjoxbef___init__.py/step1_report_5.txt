{
  "purpose": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it, likely to run obfuscated malicious code.",
  "sources": "Input source is the base64-encoded string passed to base64.b64decode.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decoded code, which is the sink for the potentially malicious payload.",
  "flows": "Base64-encoded string -> base64.b64decode -> exec() executes decoded code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is heavily obfuscated via base64 encoding, and the actual payload is hidden. Use of exec() on decoded data is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the base64 module and decodes a large base64 string. It then executes the decoded code using exec(). The content of the decoded string is obscured, but the pattern suggests an attempt to conceal malicious code. The decoded payload likely contains malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation, as indicated by the use of exec on obfuscated data. This pattern is typical in malicious supply chain exploits or trojanized packages. The reliance on dynamic decoding and execution without any validation or context indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious in intent, using heavy obfuscation via base64 and executing the payload dynamically. It aims to conceal malicious operations executed at runtime, posing a high security risk.",
