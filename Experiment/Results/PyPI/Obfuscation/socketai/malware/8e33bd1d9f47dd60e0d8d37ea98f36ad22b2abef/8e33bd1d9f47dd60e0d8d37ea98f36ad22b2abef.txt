      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The scores assigned are appropriate, reflecting high malware likelihood, obfuscation, and security risk. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent, but current evidence warrants caution."
