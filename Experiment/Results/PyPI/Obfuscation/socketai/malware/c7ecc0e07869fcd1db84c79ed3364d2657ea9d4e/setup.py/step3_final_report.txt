  "purpose": "A minimal setup script defining a package with an obfuscated name and a fixed dependency.",
  "sources": "Static code defining package name and dependencies; no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file operations; only static configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual, nonsensical package name 'jhjc02g1cw1x4w2m', which may indicate obfuscation or suspicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setuptools setup script with a nonsensical package name. No malicious code, backdoors, or dynamic behaviors are present. The only anomaly is the package name, which could be obfuscated. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with the suspicion limited to the package name. Malware scores are appropriately zero; obfuscation scores reflect suspicion about the name; security risks are minimal. The code's static nature and lack of external data flow confirm low threat levels. The obfuscated name warrants further review in context but does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with an obfuscated package name. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is present. The scores are appropriate, with a slight suspicion due to the package name. No changes are necessary; the overall security risk remains very low.",
