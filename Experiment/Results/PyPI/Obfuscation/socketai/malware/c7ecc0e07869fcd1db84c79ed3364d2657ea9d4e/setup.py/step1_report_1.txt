  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'jhjc02g1cw1x4w2m', specifying package version and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statements and the setup() function parameters, including the package name, version, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data during the installation process; dependencies like 'requests' could potentially be used insecurely if misused elsewhere, but this code does not show such usage.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration specifies the package metadata and dependencies, which are used during package installation; no untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The package name appears randomly generated or obfuscated, which can be suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious logic. The package name appears non-meaningful, which could be an obfuscation tactic or an indicator of malicious intent, but on its own, this is not malicious. There are no sources or sinks indicating data leaks or malicious actions. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual code are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup file with an unusual package name, which could warrant further review in context but does not show malicious behavior or security risks by itself.",
