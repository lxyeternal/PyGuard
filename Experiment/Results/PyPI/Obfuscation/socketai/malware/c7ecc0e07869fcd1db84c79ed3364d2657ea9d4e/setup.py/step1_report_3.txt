  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of a Python project, specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; no sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "The package name appears non-descriptive and randomly generated, which can be suspicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines package metadata, and specifies a fixed dependency version. It lacks any dynamic code, user input, or network activity. The package name 'jhjc02g1cw1x4w2m' is unusual and may indicate obfuscation or non-legitimate intent, but this alone isn't definitive. The code appears standard for Python packaging and contains no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, with a potentially suspicious package name but no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. No security risks are apparent based on this snippet.",
