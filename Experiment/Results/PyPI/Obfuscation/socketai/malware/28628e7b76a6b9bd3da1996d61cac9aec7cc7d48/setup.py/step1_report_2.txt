  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom installation command.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports modules and runs a system command during install.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing a bash command that initiates a reverse shell connection to an external IP and port.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method executes a bash reverse shell command, connecting to IP 114.116.119.253 on port 7777.",
  "anomalies": "The use of os.system to execute a reverse shell command during install is highly unusual and suspicious; it indicates potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setuptools modules and defines a custom install class. The run method, after completing the standard install, executes a bash command that opens a reverse shell to an external IP address. This behavior is not typical for a legitimate package and suggests malicious activity aimed at creating backdoor access. There are no other external data sources or inputs; the malicious action is embedded directly in the install process.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code that, upon installation, establishes a reverse shell connection to an external server. The reverse shell behavior is indicative of malware designed for remote access or control. The overall security risk is high due to this backdoor, and the package should not be used.",
