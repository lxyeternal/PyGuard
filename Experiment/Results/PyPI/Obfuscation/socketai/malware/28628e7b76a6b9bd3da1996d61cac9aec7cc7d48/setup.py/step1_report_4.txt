{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up and install a Python package with a custom installation command.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data during execution, but it does execute a system command during installation.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing a bash command that initiates a reverse shell connection to an external IP address and port.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method executes a reverse shell by calling os.system with a bash command that connects to 114.116.119.253 on port 7777.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a reverse shell command in a setup script is highly unusual and suspicious. The code does not log or verify the command, and the IP address and port are hardcoded, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a custom install class that overrides the run method. The overridden run method calls the standard install process and then executes a reverse shell via os.system. The reverse shell command attempts to connect back to an external IP address, suggesting remote access or control. This behavior is malicious and designed to compromise the system during package installation. The rest of the code appears normal, but the inclusion of this reverse shell constitutes a clear security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior—specifically, a reverse shell payload embedded in the setup process. It is likely intended for remote access or control of the system where the package is installed. The code should be considered malicious and should not be used or distributed.",
