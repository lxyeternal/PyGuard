{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom install process.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data, but it imports system modules and executes a command during installation.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a command that could be used to establish a network connection, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run method executes a bash command that opens a reverse shell connection to an external IP address.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install command includes a reverse shell payload that connects to an external IP, which is unusual and suspicious for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class inheriting from setuptools. During the run method, after completing the standard install, it executes a bash command that creates a reverse TCP connection to IP 114.116.119.253 on port 7777. This behavior indicates an attempt to establish remote access without user consent. The rest of the setup code appears standard, but the embedded reverse shell payload is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior in the form of a reverse shell payload embedded in the installation process. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicates the package is intended to compromise or control the system it is installed on.",
