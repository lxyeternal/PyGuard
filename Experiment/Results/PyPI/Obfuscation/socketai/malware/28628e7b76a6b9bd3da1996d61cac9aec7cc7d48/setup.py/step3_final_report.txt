{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to execute a reverse shell connection to an external IP during package installation, effectively creating a backdoor for remote access.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the setup process, specifically executing a system command via os.system during installation.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a bash command that opens a network connection to an external IP, potentially allowing remote control or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input (installation trigger) leads to execution of os.system, which runs the bash reverse shell command connecting to 114.116.119.253:7777.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a hardcoded IP address and port in a reverse shell command, executed during setup, which is unusual and suspicious. The package name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, possibly to evade detection.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly executes a reverse shell payload during the installation process, establishing a network connection to an external IP. The use of os.system with a direct bash command indicates malicious intent. The package name's obfuscation does not affect the malicious nature of the embedded command. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1, securityRisk: 1, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the evidence. No logical errors or false positives are present; the malicious activity is clear and straightforward. The high security risk and malware scores are justified given the active backdoor. The code is not obfuscated but directly malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code contains a clear and active malicious backdoor that executes a reverse shell during installation. The reports correctly identify this behavior, and the assigned scores are appropriate. The package should be flagged as malicious, and its distribution halted to prevent system compromise.",
