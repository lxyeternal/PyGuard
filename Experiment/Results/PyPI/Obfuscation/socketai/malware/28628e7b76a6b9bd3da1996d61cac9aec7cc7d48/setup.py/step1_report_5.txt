{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that customizes the installation process.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version) and executes a custom install command that runs a system command.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a bash command that opens a reverse shell connection to a specific IP and port.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method executes os.system with a reverse shell command, potentially exposing the system to remote control.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system to execute a hardcoded bash reverse shell command is highly unusual in standard setup scripts. The IP address and port are hardcoded, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines a custom install command class, and overrides the run method to execute a reverse shell upon installation. This is suspicious because setup scripts are generally for installing packages and should not execute network connections or reverse shells. The reverse shell command is embedded directly within os.system, which is a common technique for malicious persistence or remote access. The package name appears random and potentially obfuscated, likely to evade detection. There are no other code paths or inputs; the malicious command executes immediately after installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior: it installs a package that, upon installation, connects to an external IP via a reverse shell, likely for remote access or control. The code is intentionally obfuscated in its purpose, and the inclusion of a reverse shell is a clear security threat.",
