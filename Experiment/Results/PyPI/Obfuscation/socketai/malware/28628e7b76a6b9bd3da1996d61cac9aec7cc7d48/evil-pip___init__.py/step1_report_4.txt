  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks like network connections, system commands, or data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable data flows from input sources to any sinks, as no such elements are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is entirely absent; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are detectable.",
  "analysis": "Since no code has been provided for review, no analysis of source, sink, flow, or anomalies can be performed. The lack of code makes it impossible to identify any malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be empty or missing, thus no malicious activity or vulnerabilities can be determined.",
