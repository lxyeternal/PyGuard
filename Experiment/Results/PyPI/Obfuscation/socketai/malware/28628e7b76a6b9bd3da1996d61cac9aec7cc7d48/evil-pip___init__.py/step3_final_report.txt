  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs from environment variables, user input, network connections, dynamic code execution points like eval or exec.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, system commands, environment variables, file operations, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input may flow into dynamic execution functions or network calls, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, dynamic execution functions ('eval', 'exec'), minimal or suspicious code structure, hardcoded credentials, or hidden network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets show minimal or no explicit malicious activity. Reports identify potential obfuscation and dynamic code execution but lack concrete evidence of malicious payloads. The scores assigned reflect suspicion levels: malware scores are zero or very low, obfuscation scores are moderate where suspicion exists, and security risks are low. Confidence levels are moderate to high, given the static nature of the analysis and absence of confirmed malicious behavior. Slight adjustments to malware and security risk scores are recommended for consistency, especially lowering some scores where suspicion is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the code appears benign with some suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution indicators. The current scores are appropriate, with minor adjustments to reflect the absence of confirmed malicious activity. Continuous monitoring and dynamic analysis are advised for further assurance.",
