  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific computational task, likely related to data processing or utility functions, but no explicit purpose is clearly stated in the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly visible; the code does not clearly read external inputs or data sources such as files, network, environment variables, or user input within the provided segment.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network communication functions, file operations, or system commands, but none are explicitly invoked or shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows, as the code mainly consists of function definitions and variable assignments without external data handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no hard-coded credentials, obfuscated elements, or suspicious constructs. There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, unusual variable naming, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python constructs, including function definitions, variable initializations, and control structures. No malicious or suspicious patterns such as malicious imports, network calls, or data leakage points are present. It seems to perform normal operations without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign and straightforward. Confidence in this assessment is high, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
