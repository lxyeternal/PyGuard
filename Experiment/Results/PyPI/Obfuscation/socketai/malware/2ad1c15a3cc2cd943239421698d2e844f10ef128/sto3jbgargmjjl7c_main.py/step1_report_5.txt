  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the user via input() functions and possibly from environment variables or external files if used.",
  "sinks": "Data might be output to the console, files, or network connections if such code exists.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output or external connections, if present.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are detected. No hidden or malicious code patterns are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with clear function definitions and standard library usage. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection are observed. Usage of third-party libraries seems benign. The absence of hidden or obfuscated code suggests no malicious intent. The code's structure and comments indicate typical application logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be legitimate utility or processing code with no signs of supply chain sabotage or malware.",
