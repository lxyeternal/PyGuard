  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that suspicious techniques like eval()/exec() and obfuscation increase the malware and obfuscation scores appropriately. Benign code is correctly scored with minimal risk. The scores for the suspicious code are justified, but further runtime testing is recommended to confirm malicious activity. Overall, the scoring aligns with the observed code features."
