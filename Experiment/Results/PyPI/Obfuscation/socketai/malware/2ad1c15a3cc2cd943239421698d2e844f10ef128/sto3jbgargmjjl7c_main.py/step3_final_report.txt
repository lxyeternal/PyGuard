  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, and suspicious constructs.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., input(), environment variables), network or file system access points, dynamic code execution (eval()/exec()), obfuscated variables or code segments.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writing, system commands, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input/env variables flow into eval()/exec() or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec(), heavily obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, dynamic code generation, unusual variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution techniques, which are often used in malicious scripts. The presence of eval()/exec() significantly increases suspicion, especially when combined with obfuscated variables. Benign code shows standard patterns with no suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0.4, obfuscated=0.8, securityRisk=0.6) are justified given the techniques used, though not definitive of malicious intent. The overall risk is elevated mainly due to dynamic code execution and obfuscation, warranting further dynamic analysis. Benign reports show no suspicious features, with low scores and no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that suspicious techniques like eval()/exec() and obfuscation increase the malware and obfuscation scores appropriately. Benign code is correctly scored with minimal risk. The scores for the suspicious code are justified, but further runtime testing is recommended to confirm malicious activity. Overall, the scoring aligns with the observed code features.",
