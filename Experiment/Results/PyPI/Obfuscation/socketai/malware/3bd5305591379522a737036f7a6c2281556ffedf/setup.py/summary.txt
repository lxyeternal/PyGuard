  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates highly suspicious behavior indicative of malicious activity, primarily due to executing an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup. The use of stealth techniques and error suppression increases the risk profile. While the exact payload remains unknown without decoding, the pattern aligns with common malicious tactics in supply chain compromises."
