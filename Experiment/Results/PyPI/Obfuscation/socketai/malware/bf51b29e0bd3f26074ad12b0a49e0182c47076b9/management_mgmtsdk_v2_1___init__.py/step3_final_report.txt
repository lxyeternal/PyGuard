{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with environment variables and performs network/file operations, with no detected malicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, performs network and file I/O operations",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access",
  "flows": "Environment variables → code logic → network/file operations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables and interacts with network/file systems but lacks malicious constructs or obfuscation. The data flow from environment variables into network/file operations is typical but could pose risks if inputs are untrusted. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The confidence in benignity is high, and no malicious activity is detected. The security risk score is moderate due to potential misuse of untrusted data sources, but overall, the code appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk is moderate but justified by the interactions with environment variables and network operations. Scores are consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
