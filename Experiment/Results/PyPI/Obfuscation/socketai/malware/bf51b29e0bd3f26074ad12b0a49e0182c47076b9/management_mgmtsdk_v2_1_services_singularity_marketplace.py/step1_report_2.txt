{
  "purpose": "This code provides a client interface for interacting with a marketplace API, including querying, installing, updating, enabling/disabling, and deleting applications.",
  "sources": "Input data includes method parameters such as query_filter, app_catalog_id, app_id, ids, configurations, and other keyword arguments; these are used to construct query parameters and request payloads.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could be sent to API endpoints via GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests, especially through query parameters, request bodies, or endpoint formatting with user-provided IDs.",
  "flows": "Input data (query_filter, ids, configurations, etc.) flows into API request parameters and payloads; responses are processed and returned as data, with error handling via raise_from_response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code performs standard API request operations with typical error logging. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical client wrapper for a REST API, with methods for querying, installing, updating, enabling/disabling, and deleting applications. It uses standard patterns for constructing query parameters and handling responses. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or covert data leaks, are evident. The only potential concern could be the handling of IDs and query parameters, but these are typical in API clients. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URL manipulations, or obfuscated parts are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client implementation for a marketplace service. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical usage patterns. It is safe based on the provided code.",
