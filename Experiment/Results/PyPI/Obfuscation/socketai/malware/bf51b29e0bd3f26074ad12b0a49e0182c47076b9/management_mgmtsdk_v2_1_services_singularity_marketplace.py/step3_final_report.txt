  "purpose": "API client wrapper for marketplace operations, constructing query parameters, making network requests, and processing responses.",
  "sources": "Method parameters used to build query filters and request payloads; network responses from client.get/post/put/delete methods.",
  "sinks": "Network request functions where data is sent or received, primarily the client methods.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into query parameters and request data; responses are processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client implementation with standard request handling and error management. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The network interactions are typical for such clients, and input data is managed via query filters and method arguments, which is standard practice. No signs of security flaws or malicious intent are evident. The low malware score (0) and minimal security risk (around 0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the code's function and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client with no indications of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The existing reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
