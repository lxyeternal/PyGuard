  "purpose": "Initialization of authentication management attributes such as headers, cookies, and token.",
  "sources": "None; static attribute assignment within __init__ method.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "None; no external input or data transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward attribute initialization with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a simple constructor that sets static values for headers, cookies, and token. There are no external inputs, network communications, or data processing. The code is clear, minimal, and does not contain hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. Based on the provided snippet and reports, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a basic data container for authentication state. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and significant security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the minimal security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified as a conservative measure but does not indicate actual threat.",
