  "purpose": "Manage authentication headers, cookies, and token state for HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Initialization of headers, cookies, and token in the constructor.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling beyond initialization.",
  "flows": "No data flows beyond setting default attributes during object instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual behavior, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The class only initializes basic attributes related to authentication management. It sets a static content-type header, an empty cookies dictionary, and a None token. There are no data reads from external sources, no processing, no network communication, and no security-sensitive operations observed. The code appears to be a straightforward setup for managing auth state.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple, benign class constructor intended for managing authentication data.",
