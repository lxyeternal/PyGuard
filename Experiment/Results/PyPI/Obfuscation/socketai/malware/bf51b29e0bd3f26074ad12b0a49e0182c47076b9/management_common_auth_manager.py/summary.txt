  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a basic data container for authentication state. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and significant security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the minimal security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified as a conservative measure but does not indicate actual threat."
