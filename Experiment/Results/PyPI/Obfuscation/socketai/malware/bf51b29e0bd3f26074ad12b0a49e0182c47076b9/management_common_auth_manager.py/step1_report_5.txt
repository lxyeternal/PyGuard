{
  "purpose": "The class AuthManager appears to be designed for managing authentication tokens, headers, and cookies for HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Initialization of headers, cookies, and token variables; no input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data is being sent or processed beyond variable initialization.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only initializes variables.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious variable names, or unusual code constructs. The code snippet is minimal and appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an initializer that sets up headers for JSON content type, and initializes empty cookies and token variables. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network operations, or suspicious logic. The snippet is too small to indicate malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet alone, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is a simple setup for handling authentication headers and cookies, with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
