  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code only initializes static attributes with no external input, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior.\n- The confidence is high (1), and it correctly identifies no security risks or malware.\n- The score for malware is 0, which is appropriate.\n- No issues found; the report is accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the lack of external inputs or suspicious activity.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still reasonable.\n- Malware score is 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- No issues here.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the same points: straightforward initialization with no external data or malicious activity.\n- Confidence is high (1).\n- Malware score remains 0.\n- Accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk score (0.1). This might suggest a minimal concern, perhaps due to the general nature of the code.\n- No malware detected, and the analysis is consistent.\n- The security risk score could be justified as minimal, but not significant.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, with high confidence (0.9), no malicious activity, and no suspicious patterns.\n- Security risk score is 0.1, which seems reasonable given the minimal setup.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking the scores:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the reports indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the code being straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code snippet is very simple, only initializing class attributes.\n- No external inputs, no data flows, no network communication, no hardcoded secrets.\n- No obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n### My recommendations:\n\n- The malware score should remain **0** for all reports.\n- The obfuscated score should stay **0**.\n- The overall security risk should be **0** or **0.1**; the small non-zero value can be justified as a conservative measure, but it's not indicative of actual risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or 0.1 (0.1 acceptable for minor uncertainty).\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Based on the entire set, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (since the code is benign and minimal)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
