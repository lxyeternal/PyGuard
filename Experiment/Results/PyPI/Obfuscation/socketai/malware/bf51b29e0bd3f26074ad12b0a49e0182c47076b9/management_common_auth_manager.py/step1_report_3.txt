  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink in this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal; no hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The class defines an authentication manager with an HTTP content-type header, cookies dictionary, and a token placeholder. It does not perform any data input, network communication, or data processing in this fragment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. The code appears to be a standard setup for managing authentication state.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, serving as a simple container for authentication-related data. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
