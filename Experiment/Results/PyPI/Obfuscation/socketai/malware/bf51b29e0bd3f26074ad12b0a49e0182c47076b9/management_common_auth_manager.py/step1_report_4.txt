  "purpose": "Manage authentication headers, cookies, and token storage for HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Initialization method (__init__), which sets headers, cookies, and token.",
  "sinks": "None present in the provided code; no data outputs or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing beyond setting initial variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; only simple variable initialization.",
  "analysis": "The class defines an authentication manager with basic attributes for headers, cookies, and token. There are no active data flows, no external network connections, or code execution. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present in this fragment. It appears to be standard setup code for managing auth-related data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward and appears to be a benign part of an authentication handling system. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are detected in this fragment.",
