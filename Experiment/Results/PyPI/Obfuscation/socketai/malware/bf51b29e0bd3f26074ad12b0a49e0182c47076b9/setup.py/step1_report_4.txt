{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution via setuptools",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata such as package name, version, and license from the setup() function arguments",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present in the code",
  "flows": "N/A — static metadata assignment with no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'w0ppszsryvt5czrn' appears random and obfuscated, which can be suspicious. The license is simply 'SentinelOne', which is an unusual choice for open-source packages. No other anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools functions and defines a package version. The setup() call only includes static, hardcoded package information. There are no dynamic or user-input components, nor any network or file operations. The package name's obfuscated appearance may suggest an attempt to disguise or evade detection, but no malicious code or behavior is present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily defines package metadata with no evident malicious intent. The obfuscated package name is unusual but not inherently malicious. There are no security risks or malware indicators within this code snippet.",
