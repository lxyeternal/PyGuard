{
  "purpose": "Define and set up a Python package named 'w0ppszsryvt5czrn' with version 1.0.0 and license 'SentinelOne'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values for package metadata (name, version, license).",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks, network calls, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "No untrusted input flows present; data flows only involve static metadata assignments.",
  "anomalies": "The package name appears to be a randomized or obfuscated string, which is unusual for legitimate packages. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package setup parameters. The package name 'w0ppszsryvt5czrn' does not correspond to a recognizable or meaningful name, suggesting obfuscation or malicious intent to hide purpose. No input/output, network, or dynamic code execution is present. The license field is a standard string and does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with an unusually obfuscated package name. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
