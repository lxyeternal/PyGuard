  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers and levels based on environment variables for a management SDK.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'.",
  "sinks": "Log file specified by 'SDK_LOG_PATH'.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> log path and level -> log handlers -> logging output to file and stdout.",
  "anomalies": "None apparent; use of environment variables to configure logging is standard. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging handlers, including a file handler whose path can be set via environment variable. The log level can be configured via an environment variable. The default log path is determined based on the platform. All configuration is driven by environment variables, which is typical for customizable logging. There is no data transmission, secret management, or suspicious code execution. No external network connections or system modifications are present. Overall, this appears to be standard logging setup code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward logging configuration script that uses environment variables for customization. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe.",
