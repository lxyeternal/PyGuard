  "purpose": "Set up logging handlers with configurable log file path and level, controlled via environment variables, for the 'MgmtSdk' logger.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'; system platform info for default path.",
  "sinks": "None; code only configures logging handlers without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log path and level; handlers are added to the logger; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard logging setup; no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger with a name 'MgmtSdk', defines a function to set default handlers with a platform-aware temp directory for logs, and uses environment variables for configuration. It adds a file handler and a stream handler with a formatter, then sets the log level. The handlers are added only if a specific environment variable indicates so. The code is straightforward, uses standard practices, and does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging setup with configurable parameters via environment variables. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect this benign nature.",
