{
  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers for the 'MgmtSdk' module, setting log levels and output destinations based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS' used to determine log file path, log level, and whether to initialize handlers.",
  "sinks": "Log data written to specified log file or standard output; no untrusted input flows are evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to set log configuration; these influence log handler setup, which writes logs to file and stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code safely handles environment variables for logging configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a logging configuration function that reads environment variables to determine log file location and log level. It sets up file and stream handlers with appropriate formatters. The environment variable 'SDK_LOG_PATH' is used directly for the log file location, but this is standard practice and not inherently malicious. The code conditionally initializes handlers based on 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'. There are no obfuscation tactics, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors present. Overall, the code appears to be a standard logging setup with environment-based configurability, which is common in SDKs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logging setup script with configurable environment variables. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It securely configures logging handlers without any signs of sabotage or malware.",
