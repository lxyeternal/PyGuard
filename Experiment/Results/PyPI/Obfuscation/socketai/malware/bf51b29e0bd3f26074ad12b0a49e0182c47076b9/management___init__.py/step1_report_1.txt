  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers with customizable log file path and log level, and attach them to the 'MgmtSdk' logger.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'; system platform information for determining temp directory.",
  "sinks": "Log data written to the specified log file and standard output.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log file path and log level, which affect logging behavior and output destinations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to set log configuration is common; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution or unusual logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging handlers with configurable file path and log level based on environment variables. The log file path defaults to a temporary directory, with the possibility of external override via 'SDK_LOG_PATH'. The log level is configurable with default 'debug'. There is a check for whether to activate default handlers based on an environment variable. All operations are standard logging setup procedures with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard logging setup with configurable parameters via environment variables. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended for debugging or operational logging.",
