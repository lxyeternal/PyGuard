  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers for the 'MgmtSdk' logger, setting log file and output stream based on environment variables and defaults.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'.",
  "sinks": "Log messages written to file at 'SDK_LOG_PATH' and standard output.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log level and log file path, affecting how logs are handled and where they are stored.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code functions as a typical logging setup with environment-configurable parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger, defines a function to set default handlers, determines log file location and log level based on environment variables, and adds handlers accordingly. The log file path can be influenced by external environment variables, but no hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior are present. The code includes standard logging setup without suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging configuration script that dynamically sets log handlers based on environment variables. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
