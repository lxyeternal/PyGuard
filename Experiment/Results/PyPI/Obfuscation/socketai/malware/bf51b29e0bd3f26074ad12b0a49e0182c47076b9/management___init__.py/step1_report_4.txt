  "purpose": "Set up logging configuration for the management SDK, including file and console handlers with configurable log level and path.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'; system platform info; temporary directory for default log file.",
  "sinks": "Log messages written to the specified log file and stdout.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log level and file path; log handlers output formatted logs to file and stdout.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to determine log configuration is standard; no unusual or suspicious code or data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging handlers based on environment variables, allowing configurable log output and level. It uses standard Python logging practices without any obfuscation or malicious behavior. The log file path is determined by an environment variable or defaults to a temp directory, which is typical. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data leakage mechanisms are present. The code simply sets up logging infrastructure, and the use of environment variables does not pose a security risk in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical logging setup with configurable parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard implementation for logging configuration.",
