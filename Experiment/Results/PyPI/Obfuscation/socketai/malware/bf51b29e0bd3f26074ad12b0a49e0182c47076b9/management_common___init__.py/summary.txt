  "conclusion": "The code exhibits some suspicious patterns, particularly in report 2, but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Scores are appropriately assigned, with higher suspicion in report 2 and minimal risk in others. The overall security posture remains low to moderate, warranting monitoring but not immediate disqualification."
