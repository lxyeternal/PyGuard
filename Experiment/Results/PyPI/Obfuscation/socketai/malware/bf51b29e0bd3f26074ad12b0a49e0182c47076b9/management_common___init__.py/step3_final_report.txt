  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, system commands, network interactions, data input points, external modules",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, subprocess executions, environment variable usage",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into subprocess calls, network communication, or data processing functions",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic code execution, unvalidated environment variables, complex control flow, obfuscation hints, hardcoded commands",
  "analysis": "The code shows patterns of potential suspicion, especially in report 2, with dynamic execution and environment variable usage without validation. No explicit malicious actions are confirmed, but behaviors like subprocess calls and obfuscation suggest caution. Other reports lack code or show benign patterns. The suspicious behaviors justify moderate malware and security risk scores, while the absence of concrete malicious activity keeps overall risk low.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits some suspicious patterns, particularly in report 2, but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Scores are appropriately assigned, with higher suspicion in report 2 and minimal risk in others. The overall security posture remains low to moderate, warranting monitoring but not immediate disqualification.",
