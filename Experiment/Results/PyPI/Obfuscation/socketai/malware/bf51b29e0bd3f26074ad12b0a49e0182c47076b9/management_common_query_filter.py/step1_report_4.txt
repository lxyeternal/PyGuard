  "purpose": "Define classes and constants for constructing and validating query filters for API calls, supporting various scope filters and operators.",
  "sources": "Input data occurs in the form of filter arguments passed to get_query_params and apply methods; class initialization and attribute access serve as configuration points.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the self.filters dictionary where validated filter conditions are stored, which could potentially be used to craft malicious API queries if misused, but there are no direct security-sensitive sinks like network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from filter argument inputs through validation and transformation functions into the filters dictionary, with possible transformations via transform() and apply().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials; the code relies on standard exception handling; no signs of obfuscated or malicious code; the apply method and filter application seem straightforward. The transform method constructs filter strings; the overall logic is standard for filter building.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of classes to create, validate, and transform query filters, including scope-specific subclasses. It uses exception handling for validation errors, and the core logic involves mapping user inputs into filter dictionaries with allowed operators. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a secure, typical filter builder implementation with input validation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. Overall, the structure and flow are clear, with proper exception handling and no indicators of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a filter construction utility for API query parameters, with appropriate validation and transformation logic. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks evident. It appears to be a legitimate component for managing query filters with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
