{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and methods for constructing, transforming, and validating query filters for API calls, supporting various filter scopes and operators.",
  "sources": "The code reads filter arguments provided via method parameters and class attributes, notably from the 'filter_args' dictionary, and from the 'query_filter' object properties.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly handle untrusted external input in a way that leads to data leaks or code execution; however, the 'apply' method constructs filter dictionaries that are later used in API queries.",
  "flows": "Input filter arguments are split and validated by 'SplittedHelper', then passed to 'apply', which adds them to 'filters'. 'get_query_params' converts filter objects or args into query parameters, which are then used for API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs standard validation and transformation without obfuscated logic or hidden behaviors. No dynamic code execution, code injection, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a structured approach for building query filters with validation and transformation, supporting different filter scopes. It uses exception handling to enforce allowed filter fields and operators. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors is found. The logic is straightforward, focusing on filter validation and assembly. The code adheres to standard design patterns without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation for managing query filters in an API context. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It does not handle untrusted data in a way that poses a security threat outside of typical input validation, which is appropriately enforced.",
