{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for constructing, validating, and transforming query filters for API requests, including scope-specific subclasses.",
  "sources": "Input filter arguments in methods like apply() and get_query_params(), class attributes defining allowed filter fields.",
  "sinks": "The filters dictionary storing transformed filter keys and values, used in API query construction.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are validated and transformed via apply() and get_query_params(), stored in self.filters, then used in API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filter validation, transformation, and scope management. It uses exception handling appropriately, with no external data leaks or command executions. The logic is clear, maintainable, and typical for such utility classes. No malicious or obfuscated code identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of query filter management with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misuse if filters are misconfigured, but no active vulnerabilities are present.",
