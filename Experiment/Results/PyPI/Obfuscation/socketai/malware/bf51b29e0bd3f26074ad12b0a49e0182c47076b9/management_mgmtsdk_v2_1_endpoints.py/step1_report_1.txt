{
  "purpose": "This module defines URL endpoints used by the SentinelOne management API for various operations such as threats, agents, firewall control, RANGER, application management, and other security functions.",
  "sources": "String assignments defining URL endpoints for API interactions. No external input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable endpoints if used improperly, but no direct data handling or untrusted data processing observed within this code.",
  "flows": "No dynamic URL constructions or untrusted data flow evident. The code provides static endpoint strings only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic. All URLs appear to be standard API endpoints without unusual patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant string definitions for various API endpoints. There is no data processing, user input handling, or dynamic code execution. Endpoints seem legitimate for a security management system. No signs of malicious behavior such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels. The structure and content are typical for an API route definitions module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of URL endpoint definitions for SentinelOne management API. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The likelihood of malware or malicious behavior is extremely low.",
