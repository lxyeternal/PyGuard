{
  "purpose": "This module defines URL endpoints used for communication with SentinelOne management APIs, covering threats, agents, policies, and other security functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code sources endpoint string definitions, mostly as constants assigned to URL path strings.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks involve untrusted data handling, command execution, or network operations. The code only defines static strings for endpoints.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow pathways from untrusted sources to sinks within this code, as it only establishes endpoint URL constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely declarative, defining endpoint URLs; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant string definitions for API endpoints used throughout the SentinelOne management system. There are no input processing, no data manipulation, no dynamic code execution, and no embedded logic. All endpoints appear to be static URL paths intended for legitimate API interactions. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The structure is straightforward, with endpoints covering threats, agents, tags, firewall controls, and other management features, consistent with a standard API client setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely declarative, serving as a centralized set of API endpoint constants for SentinelOne management. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident from this code segment.",
