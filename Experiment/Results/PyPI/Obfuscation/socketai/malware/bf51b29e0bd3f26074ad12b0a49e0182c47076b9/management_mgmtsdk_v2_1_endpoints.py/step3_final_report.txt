  "purpose": "This module contains static URL endpoint definitions for SentinelOne management API functions, serving as configuration constants.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments with placeholders; no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; purely constant definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or dynamic URL construction; static references only.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants representing API endpoints. There is no executable logic, data processing, or dynamic code that could be malicious. The endpoint paths are standard for management APIs and do not contain embedded malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static configuration of API routes. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
