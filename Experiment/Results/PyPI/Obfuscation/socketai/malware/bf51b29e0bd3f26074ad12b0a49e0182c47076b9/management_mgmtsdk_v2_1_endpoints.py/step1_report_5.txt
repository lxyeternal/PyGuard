  "purpose": "Defines URL endpoints for SentinelOne management API interactions.",
  "sources": "String constants defining URL paths for API endpoints; no dynamic input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no execution or data manipulation within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data handling present; only static string definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected. All endpoints are standard API paths.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of string constants representing API endpoint URLs used for various management and control functions. No dynamic code execution, user input processing, or data handling is present. All variables are static strings intended for API calls. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and no external or hidden code is present. This code appears to be a configuration or constants module with no embedded logic or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely contains static endpoint URL definitions without any dynamic or executable components. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. It appears to be a straightforward configuration for API paths.",
