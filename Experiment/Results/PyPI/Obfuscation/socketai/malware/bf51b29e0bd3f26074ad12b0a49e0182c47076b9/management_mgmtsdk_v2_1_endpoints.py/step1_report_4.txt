{
  "purpose": "This code defines a collection of API endpoint URL paths used for communication between a management system and various modules/services in SentinelOne's platform.",
  "sources": "The code sources are static string assignments defining endpoint paths, often formatted with placeholders for dynamic segments.",
  "sinks": "The endpoints themselves serve as sinks where data can be sent to or received from external systems, but there are no evident direct untrusted data flows or input processing within this code.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic flows within this code segment; it primarily contains static definitions. If used elsewhere with user input, dynamic URL formation could occur but isn't shown here.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. All endpoint strings appear to be predefined and static. No unusual code constructs or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward collection of string constants representing API endpoints. It does not perform any data processing, input validation, or network communication itself. Since it is purely definitional, it lacks dynamic or executable logic that could be malicious. The endpoints cover a broad range of management, threat, agent, and support functions, consistent with legitimate platform features. There are no signs of backdoors, malicious data exfiltration, or suspicious code constructs. The structure is clear, and no anomalies or obfuscated parts are found.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment appears to be a safe, static configuration of API endpoints used for legitimate management purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are detectable from this code alone.",
