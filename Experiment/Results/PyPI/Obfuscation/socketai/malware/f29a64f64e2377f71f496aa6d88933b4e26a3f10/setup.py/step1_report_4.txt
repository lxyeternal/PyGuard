  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, with additional code that executes a hidden PowerShell command.",
  "sources": "The PowerShell encoded command executed via subprocess.Popen; environment checks with os.path.exists; package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executing PowerShell with encoded command; potential for malicious code execution via the encoded payload.",
  "flows": "Code checks if 'tahg' exists, then executes a PowerShell encoded command in a hidden window. The package setup is standard.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an encoded PowerShell command that runs in a hidden window; no documentation or comments explaining the purpose of this command; silent exception handling obscures errors.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in base64, which runs in the background, potentially executing arbitrary or malicious code. The command is hidden from the user. The setup function is standard but is preceded by code that could be malicious. Exception handling suppresses errors, making detection more difficult. The presence of obfuscated command execution without clear purpose indicates malicious or at least suspicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed silently, which is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious behavior. The setup code appears normal but is preceded by activity that could be used to perform malicious actions or establish backdoors. The overall risk is high due to obfuscated execution and lack of transparency.",
