{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for a Python package that collects system information and sends it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and current user (getpass.getuser()) when the install command is run.",
  "sinks": "The collected data is sent via an HTTP GET request to an external URL ('https://eol6mx6at717hhs.m.pipedream.net/generaldelta').",
  "flows": "Data from sources (hostname, cwd, username) flows directly into the request payload, which is then sent over the network to the specified URL during the installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration without user consent, during the package installation. It uses a non-obvious class name and obfuscates variable names, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent. The URL used for data exfiltration is suspicious and appears to be a custom or disposable endpoint.",
  "analysis": "The script hooks into the 'install' command of setuptools, executing code that collects environment information. Instead of simply installing the package, it silently sends sensitive system details to an external server. The obfuscation of class and variable names suggests an attempt to hide malicious behavior. There are no other malicious activities such as code execution, data theft from environment variables, or persistent backdoors, but the act of exfiltrating environment info without user consent is suspicious and could be used for tracking or reconnaissance. The URL used is non-standard and likely disposable, indicating malicious intent or at least privacy violation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent. It is designed to silently send data to an external server, which poses a privacy risk. The obfuscation and unconventional class naming further support suspicion of malicious intent.",
