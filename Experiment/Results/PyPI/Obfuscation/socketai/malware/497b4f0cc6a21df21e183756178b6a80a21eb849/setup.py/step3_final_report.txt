{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to an external URL, without user consent or notification.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to external URL",
  "flows": "source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> data assembled into dict -> requests.get() to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; data exfiltration during installation without user notification; unencrypted transmission of system info",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated custom install class that, during package installation, gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL. The obfuscation and network activity during install are suspicious. No malicious payloads like backdoors or credential theft are present, but the silent exfiltration of system info indicates malicious intent or privacy invasion. The behavior aligns with privacy-invasive or malicious tracking scripts. The obfuscation score is justified at around 0.75-0.8 due to nonsensical class and variable names. The malware score, reflecting malicious exfiltration, should be high (~0.8), as the code performs data collection and transmission without consent. The security risk score is also high (~0.85), given the privacy invasion during install. The scores in the reports are consistent with this behavior, though some undervalue the malware potential. Overall, the code exhibits suspicious, privacy-invasive behavior with obfuscation, warranting high concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized collection and exfiltration of system information during package installation, with obfuscation and external communication to a suspicious URL. This behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, primarily due to privacy invasion and covert data transmission. While it lacks destructive payloads, the exfiltration pattern and obfuscation justify high malware and risk scores. The behavior warrants caution and further review before use.",
