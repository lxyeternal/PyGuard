  "flows": "System information sources are collected in variables and sent via GET request to external URL",
  "anomalies": "The code collects hostname, current working directory, and username and sends this data to an external server without user consent or notification.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during installation, retrieves system hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this information to a remote endpoint via an HTTP GET request. This behavior could be used for tracking or data exfiltration without explicit user consent. No other malicious activities like system damage, backdoors, or credential theft are evident. The code is obfuscated through nonsensical class and variable names, which may hide malicious intent, but based solely on visible behavior, it appears to perform tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects basic system information and transmits it to a remote server during installation, which can be considered malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. The obfuscation and data exfiltration without consent are suspicious.",
