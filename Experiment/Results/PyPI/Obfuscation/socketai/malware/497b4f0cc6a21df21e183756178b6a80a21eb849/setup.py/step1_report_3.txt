  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to gather system information and send it to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname, current working directory, and username via socket, os, and getpass modules.",
  "sinks": "Requests.get() sending data to external URL.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, cwd, username) is collected and sent via HTTP GET request to a remote server during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Code executes network request during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The code collects system info without user consent and transmits it externally. The class name appears obfuscated or intentionally nonsensical, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command for setup.py, extending the standard install class. During installation, it gathers hostname, current directory, and username. Immediately afterward, it sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL. This behavior is unusual for legitimate packages, as it transmits potentially sensitive system information without user consent. The use of non-descriptive class name and external request indicates potential malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior. No other suspicious code or malicious payloads are present beyond this network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and exfiltration during package installation, which is a malicious or highly suspicious behavior. It is likely intended for tracking or unauthorized data collection. The package should be reviewed further before use.",
