{
  "purpose": "Custom setup script that collects system information and sends it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP GET request to an external server ('https://eol6mx6at717hhs.m.pipedream.net/generaldelta').",
  "flows": "System information is gathered (source), then transmitted over the network using requests.get (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The script performs data exfiltration during installation without user consent. The external URL is suspicious and possibly malicious; the code uses obfuscated class and variable names, indicating potential concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that extends setuptools. During installation, it collects hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data to a remote server via an HTTP GET request. The use of obscure class and variable names suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. No user input validation or security controls are present. The code's purpose appears to be clandestine data collection without user awareness, indicating malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly transmits sensitive system information to an external server during package installation, which constitutes malicious behavior. The obfuscation and data exfiltration point to a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
