      "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized collection and exfiltration of system information during package installation, with obfuscation and external communication to a suspicious URL. This behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, primarily due to privacy invasion and covert data transmission. While it lacks destructive payloads, the exfiltration pattern and obfuscation justify high malware and risk scores. The behavior warrants caution and further review before use."
