  "purpose": "Establish a reverse shell connection to an external server to allow remote command execution.",
  "sources": "socket connection to 8.tcp.ngrok.io:14060, reading socket file descriptor",
  "sinks": "os.dup2 to redirect stdin, stdout, stderr; subprocess.call to execute shell",
  "flows": "socket data received from network -> duplicated to stdin/out/err -> shell executed, allowing remote command control",
  "anomalies": "Function name is obfuscated, but code performs reverse shell behavior which is suspicious; no user input or data validation; hardcoded IP and port",
  "analysis": "The code creates a socket connection to an external server (ngrok.io), then redirects standard input/output/error to this socket, and finally executes an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i). This pattern is characteristic of reverse shells, often used for malicious remote access. No obfuscated code or unusual language features beyond obfuscation in the function name. No external libraries or data validation observed. The intent appears malicious as it enables remote control of the host system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is implementing a reverse shell, which is a common method for malicious remote access. It connects to an external server and redirects the shell input/output over this connection. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent.",
