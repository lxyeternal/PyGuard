{
  "purpose": "Establishes a reverse shell connection to a remote server, allowing remote control over the host system.",
  "sources": "socket.socket() creation, connect() to remote IP and port, os.dup2() redirecting stdin/stdout/stderr, subprocess.call() spawning /bin/sh -i",
  "sinks": "Redirection of socket to standard input/output/error, execution of interactive shell",
  "flows": "Socket connection → dup2() redirects streams → spawning /bin/sh -i",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name, hardcoded IP address and port, reverse shell pattern, no input validation",
  "analysis": "The code creates a socket to a specific external IP and port, redirects standard streams to this socket, and spawns an interactive shell, characteristic of a reverse shell. The function name is obfuscated, which is typical of malicious scripts aiming to hide intent. The pattern is straightforward and matches known malicious behavior. No benign features are present; the code's behavior is clearly malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a reverse shell backdoor, enabling remote control of the host. It exhibits obfuscation and hardcoded connection details, confirming malicious intent. The behavior aligns with typical malicious reverse shells, posing a high security risk.",
