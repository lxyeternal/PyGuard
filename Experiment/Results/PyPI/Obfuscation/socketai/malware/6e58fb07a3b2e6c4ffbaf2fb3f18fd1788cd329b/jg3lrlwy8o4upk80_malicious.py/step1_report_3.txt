{
  "purpose": "Establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "socket connection to 8.tcp.ngrok.io:14060, reading socket file descriptor, subprocess call to spawn shell",
  "sinks": "file descriptors duped to stdin, stdout, stderr, subprocess spawning shell",
  "flows": "socket connection -> os.dup2() redirects file descriptors -> subprocess call opens interactive shell",
  "anomalies": "Use of socket to connect to a remote server, redirecting system input/output, launching a shell remotely",
  "analysis": "The code creates a socket connection to an external IP (via ngrok), then redirects the system's standard input, output, and error streams to this socket. Finally, it spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh). This pattern is characteristic of reverse shells, commonly used by malware to maintain remote access and control over the compromised system. The code does not contain obfuscation or additional suspicious code, but its intent is malicious given the reverse shell behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to create a reverse shell, indicating malicious intent. It connects to a remote server and grants remote control over the system via an interactive shell.",
