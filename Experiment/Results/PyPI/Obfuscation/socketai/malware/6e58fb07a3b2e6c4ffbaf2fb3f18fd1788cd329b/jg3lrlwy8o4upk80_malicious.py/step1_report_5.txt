{
  "purpose": "Establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server and provide interactive shell access.",
  "sources": "The socket connection to 8.tcp.ngrok.io:14060, reading from socket and socket.file descriptor.",
  "sinks": "Standard input/output/error streams, executing /bin/sh shell.",
  "flows": "Data from socket flows into stdin, stdout, and stderr via os.dup2, then a shell is invoked, allowing remote command execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated function and variable names; establishes a reverse shell connection, which is suspicious and typical of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a socket connection to an external IP, redirects standard input/output/error to this socket, and launches an interactive shell. This pattern is commonly used for unauthorized remote access or backdoors. The use of obfuscated names suggests an attempt to conceal intent. There are no benign indications of intended functionality beyond reverse shell setup. The code's structure and behavior strongly indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a reverse shell backdoor, enabling remote control over the compromised system. It is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent.",
