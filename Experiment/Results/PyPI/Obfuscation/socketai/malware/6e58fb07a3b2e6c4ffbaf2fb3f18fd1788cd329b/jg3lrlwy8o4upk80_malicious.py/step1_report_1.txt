  "purpose": "Establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server for command execution.",
  "sources": "socket.socket() for network connection, socket.connect() for connecting to remote host, os.dup2() for redirecting standard input/output/error, subprocess.call() to spawn an interactive shell.",
  "sinks": "os.dup2() redirecting standard streams to network socket, subprocess.call() executing shell with redirected streams.",
  "flows": "socket connection -> os.dup2() redirects stdin/stdout/stderr -> subprocess.call() spawns shell over network.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function name, hardcoded IP and port, and a reverse shell pattern suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a network socket connecting to an external IP (8.tcp.ngrok.io) on port 14060, then redirects the process's standard input, output, and error to this socket. Subsequently, it spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh). This pattern is characteristic of a reverse shell, which allows remote control of the host system. The function name is obfuscated, which is often used to hide malicious code. All operations are consistent with malicious remote access behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a reverse shell, indicating malicious intent. It is designed to give an attacker remote control over the compromised system. The obfuscation and hardcoded IP reinforce suspicion.",
