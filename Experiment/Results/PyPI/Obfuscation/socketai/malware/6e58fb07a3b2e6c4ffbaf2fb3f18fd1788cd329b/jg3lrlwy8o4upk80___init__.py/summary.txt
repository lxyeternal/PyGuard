  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with appropriate scoring; however, the use of eval-like functions in report 4 warrants raising the malware score from 0 to around 0.6 to account for the security risk posed by dynamic code execution. Scores for obfuscation remain at 0, and risk scores are low except for report 4, which should be slightly increased to reflect potential vulnerabilities. Overall, the assessments are reasonable and align with the code behaviors, with the primary adjustment needed in report 4's malware score."
