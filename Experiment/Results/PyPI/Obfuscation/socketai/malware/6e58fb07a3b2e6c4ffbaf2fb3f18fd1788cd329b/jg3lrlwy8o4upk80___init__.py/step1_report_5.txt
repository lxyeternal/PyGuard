{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility script for data processing, possibly involving file handling and data transformation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input files or user input (e.g., open(), input()), environment variables, or network requests.",
  "sinks": "Writes data to files, displays output, or sends data over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like user input or files through processing functions to sinks such as output or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, obfuscated code segments, or unexpected dynamic code execution are not present. No unusual or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python constructs, with clear input/output operations and typical data processing. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity are evident. The structure and style do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No anomalous patterns or backdoors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward data processing script with no signs of malware or supply chain attacks.",
