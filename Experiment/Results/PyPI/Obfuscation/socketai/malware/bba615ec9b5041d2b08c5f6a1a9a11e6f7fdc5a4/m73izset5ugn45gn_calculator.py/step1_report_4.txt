{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform basic arithmetic operations and includes functions with obfuscated names. It collects environment and hostname information and exfiltrates it via an HTTP request, then establishes a reverse shell connection.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('USER', 'HOSTNAME'), socket connections, requests to external URL, socket connection to external host and port.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to external server with system info, socket connection to external host (4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:19931), spawning a shell via pty.spawn.",
  "flows": "Environment and hostname info are collected and sent via HTTP request. A socket connection is made to an external server, then the code redirects stdin, stdout, stderr to this socket, and spawns a shell, enabling remote control.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names, unusual sequence of socket connection and shell spawning, sending system info to an external URL, and establishing a reverse shell. The code does not perform legitimate calculations, indicating possible malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated class with functions for arithmetic operations, which are not used maliciously. The 'add' method, however, retrieves environment variables and hostname, then sends this info to an external URL, which could be for data exfiltration. It then creates a socket connection to an external host, redirects standard input/output/error to this socket, and spawns a shell, effectively creating a reverse shell. This behavior indicates malicious activity consistent with remote code execution or backdoor functionality. The other arithmetic functions appear benign but are likely obfuscation or decoys.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior, including data exfiltration and a reverse shell, indicative of backdoor activity. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious.",
