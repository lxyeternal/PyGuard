  "purpose": "A setup script configuring package metadata for a Python project.",
  "sources": "Static variables within the setup() call, including version string and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no dynamic data or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, high version number '1000.0.6', mention of 'Dependency Confusion POC', unused import 'codecs'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with obfuscated variable names and an unusual version string. It does not perform any dynamic actions, network calls, or data processing. The mention of 'Dependency Confusion POC' suggests testing or demonstration rather than malicious intent. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. Obfuscation is notable but not indicative of malicious behavior in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated setup script with no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation and high version number are suspicious but not malicious. The package appears low risk, primarily due to obfuscation, but further review of the full package is recommended if obfuscation is suspicious in context.",
