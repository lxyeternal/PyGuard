  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the evidence, reasoning, and scores assigned.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports focus on a single import statement of a module with an obfuscated or auto-generated name: `calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator`.\n- The code snippet is minimal, with no additional logic or data flows.\n- The main concern is the obfuscated module name and the use of wildcard imports (`import *`), which can hide malicious activity or obscure functionality.\n- No direct malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or network activity is evident solely from this import statement.\n- The scores for malware are low (mostly 0.1-0.2), reflecting suspicion but no concrete evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Presence of the code:** The import statement is present and syntactically correct.\n- **Malicious activity:** Not directly observable; no evidence of malicious code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** The module name appears obfuscated or auto-generated, which can be suspicious but is also common in some legitimate codebases or auto-generated code.\n- **Wildcard import (`import *`):** Can be used maliciously to hide imported functions or classes, but it is also a common pattern in some codebases.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning issues:\n\n- The reports reasonably identify obfuscation as a concern but do not overstate the risk without further evidence.\n- The conclusion that the code appears benign based solely on this import is appropriate.\n- The suggestion that further review of the module contents is necessary is prudent.\n\n---\n\n### Score analysis:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Ranges from 0.5 to 0.8, which seems appropriate given the obfuscated module name.\n- **Malware score:** Mostly 0.1-0.2, aligning with the lack of evidence.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher (0.2-0.3) due to potential obfuscation concerns.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores are generally reasonable. However, given the pattern of obfuscation and wildcard import, a slightly higher malware score (e.g., 0.2-0.3) could be justified if the context suggests a higher likelihood of concealment, but not necessarily malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on all reports and analysis:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain low (around 0.2), as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Justified at about 0.7, given the module name.\n- **Risk score:** Should stay around 0.3, reflecting moderate concern due to obfuscation and import style.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.2 (consistent with suspicion but no evidence)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (due to module naming pattern)\n- **Risk:** 0.3 (moderate, primarily due to obfuscation concerns)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are cautious but justified in their assessments. Further investigation into the actual contents of the `calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator` module is recommended before deployment, especially if the source is untrusted.",
