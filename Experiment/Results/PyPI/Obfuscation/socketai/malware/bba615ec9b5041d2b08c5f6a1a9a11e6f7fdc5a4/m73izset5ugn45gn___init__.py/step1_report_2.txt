{
  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the module calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator, likely to perform calculations or related operations.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the entire calculator module from a potentially obfuscated package or namespace.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are visible in this snippet; potential sinks depend on how imported components are used later in the code.",
  "flows": "Not enough information to determine data flows; the code only shows an import statement without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445' appears obfuscated or auto-generated, which can be suspicious. No other anomalies are evident from this single line.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module with a seemingly obfuscated name, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent. However, the import itself is standard Python syntax. Without additional context or usage, no malicious behavior can be confirmed. The absence of further code prevents analysis of data flows or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This single import statement alone does not indicate malicious intent; it may be part of a larger, legitimate program or a suspicious attempt to hide malicious code. Further code review is needed to determine intent.",
