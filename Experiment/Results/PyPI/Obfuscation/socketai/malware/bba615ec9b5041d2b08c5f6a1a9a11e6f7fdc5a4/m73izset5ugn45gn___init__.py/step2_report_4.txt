  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code snippet, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### **1. Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Import all functions/objects from the module.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious activity; straightforward import.\n- Confidence: 0.6\n- Obfuscated: 0.5\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report correctly notes the simplicity of the import and the lack of direct malicious indicators.\n- The module name includes a hash-like suffix, which could suggest obfuscation but isn't inherently malicious.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is evident.\n- The security risk is low, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring seems reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to report 1, with a higher obfuscation score (0.7).\n- Confidence: 0.3\n- Obfuscated: 0.7\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The concern about obfuscation is valid, given the module name.\n- The report correctly states that the import alone isn't malicious.\n- Malware score remains at 0, which is justified.\n- The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to previous reports, with a high obfuscation score (0.8).\n- Confidence: 0.6\n- Malware: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report suggests caution due to obfuscation but finds no direct malicious activity.\n- The malware score of 0.2 is slightly elevated, possibly reflecting suspicion but not confirmed maliciousness.\n- Given the evidence, a malware score of 0.2 might be slightly high unless there's additional context.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- I would lower the malware score to 0.1, considering only obfuscation without evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly reduce malware score to 0.1 for better consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Uses wildcard import (`from ... import *`), which can be suspicious.\n- Obfuscated module name (0.7).\n- Malware: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Wildcard imports are generally discouraged due to namespace pollution, which can be exploited for malicious purposes.\n- The malware score of 0.1 is acceptable but could be slightly higher if the context suggests potential concealment.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Increase malware score to 0.2 to reflect the potential risk associated with wildcard imports and obfuscation.\n- The obfuscation score remains appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly increase malware score to 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to others, with obfuscation (0.7).\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- The use of `import *` and obfuscated name is suspicious but not malicious.\n- Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code snippet is a simple import statement with an obfuscated module name.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- Obfuscation and wildcard import are red flags but not proof of malicious intent.\n- The malware scores should reflect the suspicion level based on obfuscation and import style.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.1 – Slight suspicion due to obfuscation but no concrete evidence.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.7 – Consistent across reports, justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 – Low, given the lack of malicious activity but some concern over obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- Slightly lower malware scores from 0.2 to 0.1 in reports 3 and 4.\n- Keep obfuscation scores high (around 0.7), as the module name pattern suggests obfuscation.\n- Maintain low security risk unless further code reveals malicious behavior.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0.5          | 0.2   |\n| 2       | 0       | 0.7          | 0.2   |\n| 3       | **0.1** | 0.8          | 0.2   |\n| 4       | **0.2** | 0.7          | 0.2   |\n| 5       | 0       | 0.7          | 0.2   |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the actual contents of the `calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator` module to confirm whether it contains malicious code, especially given the obfuscated naming pattern.",
