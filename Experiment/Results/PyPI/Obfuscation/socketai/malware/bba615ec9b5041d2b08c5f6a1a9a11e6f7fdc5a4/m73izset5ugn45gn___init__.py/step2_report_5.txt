  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports concern an import statement from a module named `calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator`.\n- The module name appears obfuscated or auto-generated, which can be suspicious but is not inherently malicious.\n- No code execution, data flows, or malicious activities are demonstrated in these snippets.\n- The use of `import *` in one report can be risky due to namespace pollution, but this alone doesn't imply malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are low (mostly 0.1–0.2), which aligns with the lack of evidence for malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated scores are moderate to high, reflecting suspicion about the module naming.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:**  \n  The code snippets are syntactically correct Python import statements. They do not show any errors or issues.\n\n- **Malicious activity:**  \n  There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code. The low malware scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  The high obfuscated scores are justified due to the module name's appearance, but obfuscation alone isn't malicious.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:**  \n  The use of `import *` can hide imported symbols, possibly masking malicious functions, but no such functions are visible here.\n\n---\n\n### Score assessments:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports correctly assign low malware scores (0.1–0.2). No evidence suggests malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  Scores are high (0.5–0.8), which is reasonable given the module naming pattern.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Overall, the risk scores are low (0.2–0.3). This is appropriate given the lack of evidence for malicious activity but warrants caution due to obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Specific comments:\n\n- **Report 1 & 3:**  \n  The confidence is moderate (0.6), which is justified. The obfuscated score (0.5–0.8) aligns with the suspicion about the module name. The risk score (0.2–0.3) is reasonable.\n\n- **Report 2:**  \n  Lower confidence (0.3) and higher obfuscated score (0.7). The overall assessment is cautious but justified.\n\n- **Report 4:**  \n  Slightly lower confidence (0.5) but high obfuscated score (0.7). The use of wildcard import is noted as a concern but not malicious.\n\n- **Report 5:**  \n  Similar to others, with a slightly higher confidence (0.6) and obfuscated score (0.7). The use of `import *` is flagged but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are generally consistent with the analysis.\n- Given the absence of actual malicious code, malware scores should remain low.\n- The obfuscation scores are appropriately high due to naming patterns.\n- The risk scores could be marginally increased if the context suggests untrusted sources or unknown origins, but based solely on this snippet, current scores are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on all reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.1** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.7** — module name suggests obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.3** — moderate due to obfuscation, but no active threats.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code snippets are benign in isolation. The primary concern is the obfuscated module name, which warrants further review of the actual module contents. No immediate security threat is evident from these import statements alone.",
