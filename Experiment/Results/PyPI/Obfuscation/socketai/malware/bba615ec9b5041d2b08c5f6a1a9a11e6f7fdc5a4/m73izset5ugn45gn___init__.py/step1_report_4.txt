  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the calculator module within the calculator_2c397c49ab20c445 package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing code from a potentially obfuscated or uniquely named package and module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, any imported functions or classes could be used in a malicious way later in the code; however, the import itself is a standard operation.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident from this single import statement alone. Future code execution could instantiate or invoke imported entities, which is not shown here.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445' appears to be obfuscated or auto-generated, which could be suspicious. The import uses a wildcard '*', which can hide which functions or classes are imported, potentially masking malicious or unintended behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single import statement importing all symbols from a module within a package with a possibly obfuscated name. The use of wildcard import combined with an obfuscated module name raises concerns about obscuring intent. Without further code, there is no direct malicious behavior or security risk, but the pattern can be used to hide malicious actions. The import itself is standard Python syntax, but the context suggests possible obfuscation or concealment of code, which warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet alone does not show malicious activity but uses obfuscation techniques such as a non-descriptive package/module name and wildcard import. Additional code review is necessary to determine if malicious behavior is present in the imported module or subsequent code.",
