  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the context provided.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import all functions/objects from a module with a hashed/obfuscated name.\n- **Analysis:** Standard import; no malicious behavior evident. The module name's obfuscation could be benign or suspicious but isn't conclusive.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.5 (moderate suspicion)  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (low risk)  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, with emphasis on obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscated module name raises suspicion but no evidence of malicious activity. The report notes the possibility of concealment but lacks proof.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.7 (high suspicion)  \n  - Risk: 0.2  \n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same import, highlighting obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to previous, with concern about obfuscated naming. No malicious activity is directly indicated.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.2 (slightly elevated)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.8 (very high suspicion)  \n  - Risk: 0.3  \n- **Justification for malware score:** Since the import alone doesn't show malicious activity, a malware score of 0.2 seems appropriate. Slightly elevated due to the obfuscation pattern.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Import all symbols from an obfuscated module.\n- **Analysis:** Use of wildcard import (`*`) and obfuscated name can be used to hide malicious code, but no direct evidence.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.1 (low)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.7  \n  - Risk: 0.2  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with best practices; wildcard imports are discouraged, and obfuscation raises suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same import, with mention of potential namespace pollution.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; the main concern is obfuscation and wildcard import.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.7  \n  - Risk: 0.3  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Observations & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are appropriately low or zero. The import statement alone doesn't demonstrate malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** Consistently high suspicion scores due to module naming conventions, which could be auto-generated or intentionally obfuscated.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low, reflecting the lack of concrete malicious evidence but acknowledging potential concealment.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** Given the limited context, I agree with the malware scores, mostly near zero, as no malicious activity is demonstrated.\n- **Obfuscated:** The high scores are justified; obfuscation is common in malicious code but also in legitimate auto-generated code.\n- **Risk:** Slightly higher than zero but still low, as the code snippet alone doesn't pose an immediate threat.\n\n---\n\n### **My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 to 0.1 (consistent with reports)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (due to naming patterns)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (minimal risk based on this snippet)\n\n**In conclusion**, the reports are consistent and reasonable. No significant changes are necessary. The main concern is obfuscation, which warrants further review of the actual module contents before deployment or execution.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the actual content of `calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator` to ensure it doesn't contain malicious code, especially if the module source is untrusted.",
