{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions and objects from the module calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator, likely to perform calculations or mathematical operations.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which loads code from a third-party or local module named calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator.",
  "sinks": "The imported functions or objects could potentially be used elsewhere in the code to process or execute data; however, there are no immediate sinks in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Since only an import statement is present, there are no explicit data flows, inputs, or outputs shown in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445' appears to include a hash-like suffix, which might suggest obfuscation or auto-generation, but this alone is not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of all contents from a module with a seemingly hashed or obfuscated name. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The import is standard Python syntax; however, the module's nature is unclear. Without additional context or code execution, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be a simple module import with no evident malicious intent or security risks based solely on this line. It is likely part of a larger, benign project.",
