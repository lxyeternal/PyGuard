{
  "purpose": "Import all functions and objects from an obfuscated or auto-generated module, potentially to utilize its functionality within the code.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which reads the module 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator'. No other data sources are evident in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; it does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows within this snippet; the import simply makes the module available for use elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The module name appears obfuscated or auto-generated, which can be suspicious. The use of 'import *' in some reports can hide imported symbols, but in this minimal snippet, it is not directly malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with an obfuscated module name. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. The obfuscation and wildcard import patterns are common in auto-generated or proprietary code but can also be used to conceal malicious intent. The low malware scores reflect the lack of concrete evidence. The high obfuscation scores are justified due to the module naming pattern. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants further review of the actual module contents to rule out hidden malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement itself is not malicious; it is a standard Python syntax. The primary concern is the obfuscated module name, which suggests caution but does not confirm malicious intent. No active threats or malicious behavior are detected from this snippet alone. Further inspection of the module's content is recommended before deployment, especially if sourced from untrusted origins.",
