{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions and classes from the 'calculator' module within the 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445' package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the entire 'calculator' module from the specified package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling are present in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or execution paths within this single line of code.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445' appears obfuscated or auto-generated, which could be suspicious. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged due to potential namespace pollution and difficulty in understanding dependencies. No explicit malicious behavior detected in this line alone.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement that brings in all components from a potentially obfuscated or auto-generated module. There are no direct signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection. However, the obfuscated module name warrants caution, as it may be part of a package designed to conceal malicious intent. Without further code, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with an obfuscated module name. While it does not exhibit direct malicious behavior, the obfuscation and use of 'import *' raise some suspicion about potential concealment. Additional context is needed to confirm security posture.",
