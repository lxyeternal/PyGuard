{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a malicious script designed to steal sensitive user data, including cookies, passwords, tokens, and files from various applications and browsers. It also exfiltrates information via Discord webhooks and uploads files to file-sharing services.",
  "sources": "Sources include environment variables, local file paths, browser storage directories, application directories, and network requests to external APIs (e.g., Discord, IP geolocation). It reads from cookies, local storage, login databases, and local files such as 'Local State' and 'Login Data'.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Discord webhook URLs, uploads to file-sharing sites, writing logs and files, and potential decryption of stored encrypted data using Windows crypt32 API, which could expose sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local system sources (browsers, applications) where credentials, cookies, and tokens are stored, decrypted or collected, then exfiltrated via network requests (Discord, file uploads). The code also kills processes, copies databases, and creates zip archives of collected data, indicating data exfiltration and system manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, unused or suspicious code snippets (e.g., 'ryb' variables, undefined functions like 'DecryptValue', variables like 'pathC' and 'path' undefined), code that kills processes, encrypts/decrypts data, and uploads files, which are typical behaviors of malware. Some code sections appear incomplete or inconsistent, such as malformed or partial functions and undefined variables. Use of hardcoded Discord webhook URL. Several functions handle sensitive operations without clear validation or security controls.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a stealer, collecting data from browsers and applications, decrypting stored credentials, and sending the data to external servers via network requests. It uses threading for concurrent operations, including data collection from multiple sources, process termination, and file uploads. The code manipulates encrypted data with Windows crypt32 APIs, indicating an attempt to decrypt stored credentials and cookies. It also creates zip archives of targeted directories, suggesting exfiltration. Obfuscated naming conventions and incomplete or inconsistent code segments raise suspicion of malicious intent. Several functions directly access and handle sensitive user data without validation, and the code exhibits typical malware behaviors such as process termination, data encryption/decryption, and network exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, designed to stealthily extract and exfiltrate user credentials, tokens, cookies, files, and other sensitive data from the infected system. It operates covertly, kills processes, encrypts/decrypts data, and uploads files, indicating a typical data-stealing malware. The presence of hardcoded webhooks and obfuscated variables further supports its malicious purpose.",
