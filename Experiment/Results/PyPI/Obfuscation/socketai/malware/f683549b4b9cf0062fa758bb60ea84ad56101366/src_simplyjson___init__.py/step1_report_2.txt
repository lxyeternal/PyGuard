{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a malicious payload designed to steal user data, including tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive information from various applications and browsers, then exfiltrate this data via Discord webhooks.",
  "sources": "User environment variables, local file system (browsers, applications, and system files), network requests to external APIs (Discord, geolocation, file upload), and input data from local files and system paths.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Discord webhooks, external URLs, file writing, and potentially executing or terminating processes (e.g., 'taskkill'), and file copying of sensitive databases (browsers, wallets, etc).",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local storage, browser databases, and environment variables; then sensitive information such as tokens, cookies, passwords, and other data is decrypted and compiled. This data is then sent via HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks or uploaded files to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, repeated code patterns for different browsers/applications, multiple hardcoded URLs (Discord webhook, geolocation API, file upload), and attempts to decrypt stored credentials and cookies. Also, extensive threading usage for concurrent data collection, and some malformed or inconsistent code segments indicating obfuscation or incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules, including system, threading, network, and cryptography libraries, indicating data extraction and decryption capabilities. It checks and installs dependencies silently. The script collects system info such as IP and username, then performs targeted data extraction from browsers, wallets, Steam, Riot, and other applications by copying and reading sensitive database files. It decrypts stored credentials and cookies using system APIs and local keys. The data is then formatted into Discord webhook payloads and sent over the network, with multiple functions dedicated to collecting different data types, including cookies, passwords, tokens, and files. The script also employs threading for concurrent execution and obfuscates variables with nonsensical names, typical of malware. The code also includes functions that terminate processes, zip files, and upload to external servers, further indicating malicious intent. Overall, the script is designed to stealthily extract a wide array of sensitive user data and exfiltrate it without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious malware focused on data theft from browsers, wallets, and applications. It exfiltrates information via Discord webhooks and uploads files to external servers. The code employs obfuscation, extensive data collection, and network communication to perform unauthorized surveillance of user data, indicating high malicious intent and security risk.",
