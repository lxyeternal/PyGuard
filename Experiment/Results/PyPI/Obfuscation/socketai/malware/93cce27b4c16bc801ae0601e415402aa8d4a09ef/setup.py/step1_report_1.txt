{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, including a custom install command that calls an imported function during installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP' from 'pre_install' and invokes it during the custom install process.",
  "sinks": "The function 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP' is called during installation, potentially executing arbitrary code; the setup function itself does not handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom command 'IqSxZVmHbpCZHYRMwAZTHfeUbZKyIzAf' calls 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP', which may perform malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP' has a non-descriptive, obfuscated name, indicating potential concealment of malicious behavior; the imported function is invoked during installation without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Python package with metadata and a custom install command. The custom class 'tPQyKALrqhFrEoaOrWhMnIZIBLSEFPOt' overrides the 'install' command to execute the imported function 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP'. The function's non-meaningful name and the lack of documentation suggest possible malicious intent, such as executing malicious code during installation. The setup configuration itself appears standard, but the invocation of an obscure function during installation raises suspicion. There are no other external data sources or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform a typical setup routine with an unusual, obscure function called during installation. This function could execute malicious actions, such as backdoor installation or data exfiltration, making this package potentially dangerous. The obfuscated function name and lack of documentation are suspicious.",
