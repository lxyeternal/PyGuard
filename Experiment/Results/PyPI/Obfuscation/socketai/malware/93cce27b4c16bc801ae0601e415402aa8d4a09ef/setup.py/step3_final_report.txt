{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with a custom installation step that executes an imported, obfuscated function during setup, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "Import of 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP' from 'pre_install'; invocation of this function within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the imported function during setup; potential for code that performs malicious actions such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "The setup process imports the obfuscated function, then calls it during the overridden install method, executing any code within that function.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names; invocation of external, unknown code during setup; non-functional or misleading download URL; lack of transparency about what the imported function does.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an obfuscated function from an external module and executes it during the installation process, which is unusual and suspicious. The obfuscation and execution pattern align with common tactics used in supply chain attacks to embed malicious payloads. The setup metadata appears standard, but the core concern is the execution of an opaque function during install, which could perform harmful actions. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.6-0.75, obfuscated ~0.8-0.9, security risk ~0.65-0.8) are consistent with this pattern. Without analyzing the actual implementation of the imported function, certainty cannot be established, but the pattern warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The package exhibits high obfuscation and executes an external, obscure function during installation, indicating a high potential for malicious behavior. The suspicious pattern justifies elevated malware and risk scores. Further investigation of the 'pre_install' module and the behavior of 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP' is strongly recommended before trusting or deploying this package.",
