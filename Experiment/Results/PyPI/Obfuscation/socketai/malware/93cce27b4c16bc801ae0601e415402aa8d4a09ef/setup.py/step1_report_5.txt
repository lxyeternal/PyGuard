  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that customizes the installation process.",
  "sources": "Import statements, the setup() function, and the custom install class's method call.",
  "sinks": "The call to LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP() in the custom install class.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom install class executes LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP(), which is invoked at installation time.",
  "anomalies": "The function LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP appears to be an obfuscated or nonsensical name, likely representing hidden or malicious code. The import from pre_install and the custom install class suggest potential for executing code during install.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines a custom installation class that executes a function named LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP() from pre_install. The setup() function uses this class for installation, meaning this function runs when the package is installed. The function name and import are obfuscated, raising suspicion of malicious intent, such as executing hidden code during install. The rest of the setup metadata appears standard but does not exclude malicious behavior embedded in the invoked function.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a potentially malicious function during installation, indicated by the obfuscated function name and its invocation in the custom install class. This behavior suggests a high likelihood of malicious intent or backdoor presence in the package.",
