  "conclusion": "The package exhibits high obfuscation and executes an external, obscure function during installation, indicating a high potential for malicious behavior. The suspicious pattern justifies elevated malware and risk scores. Further investigation of the 'pre_install' module and the behavior of 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP' is strongly recommended before trusting or deploying this package."
