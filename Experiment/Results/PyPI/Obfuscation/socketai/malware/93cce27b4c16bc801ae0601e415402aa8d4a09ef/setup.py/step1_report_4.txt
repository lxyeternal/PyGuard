  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with a custom installation command that executes a function from an imported module during installation.",
  "sources": "The imported module 'pre_install' and its function 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP'.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP()' during the installation process.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'install' class method 'IqSxZVmHbpCZHYRMwAZTHfeUbZKyIzAf' is called, which executes 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP()'.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP' appears obfuscated; the code imports a function with an unclear purpose and executes it during setup, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon execution, calls an imported function from 'pre_install'. The function name is obfuscated, indicating potential malicious intent or sabotage. This function is executed during the setup process, which could allow malicious behavior to run automatically upon package installation. The setup configuration itself appears standard, but the inclusion and execution of an obfuscated function is suspicious. No other malicious indicators like network calls, hardcoded secrets, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated function calls executed during setup, which could indicate malicious behavior or sabotage. The purpose of the imported function is unclear and suspicious, warranting caution before using this package.",
