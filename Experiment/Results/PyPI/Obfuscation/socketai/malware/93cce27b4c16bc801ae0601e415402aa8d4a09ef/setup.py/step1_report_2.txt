{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package installation configuration, including a custom installation command.",
  "sources": "The code imports a class 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP' from 'pre_install', which is invoked during installation.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP()' could be a sink if it executes malicious code, but its actual behavior depends on its implementation.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the custom install command calls 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP()', then proceeds with the standard install process.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names suggest intentional concealment; the imported 'pre_install' module and its method are suspicious without further context. No other anomalies like hardcoded credentials or suspicious URLs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a seemingly obscure class from 'pre_install' and executes it during installation, which is a common tactic for hiding malicious behavior. The setup configuration appears standard but is likely used to facilitate the execution of malicious code within 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP()'. The download URL is non-functional and appears intentionally misleading. The obfuscated names and dynamic code execution point to potential malicious intent, although actual behavior depends on the implementation of the imported class.",
  "conclusion": "The script employs obfuscated naming and executes code from an external module during installation, which is suspicious and could be malicious. Without further details on 'pre_install' or the imported class, the risk cannot be definitively confirmed but warrants caution.",
