{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, including a custom install command that calls an imported function during installation.",
  "sources": "Import of 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP' from 'pre_install' module; invocation within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The imported function 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP' is called during installation, which could potentially perform malicious actions if it is malicious code.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the custom install class invokes 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP', which may execute malicious or undesired behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated or nonsensical class name and function name; import from 'pre_install' which is a suspicious pattern; calling an external or hidden function during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function with a non-descriptive name from a module 'pre_install', then executes this function during a custom installation process. The obfuscated names and the function's purpose are unclear, raising suspicion of hidden or malicious behavior. The setup configuration itself appears standard, but the invocation of an external function during setup is unusual and potentially malicious if the function performs harmful actions. There are no visible hardcoded credentials or data leaks, but the pattern of invoking an obscure function at install time is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code attempts to execute an imported function during installation, which could be malicious or maliciously obfuscated. Due to obfuscated naming and the suspicious pattern, there is a risk that this package could perform undesired actions during installation. Further investigation of the 'pre_install' module is recommended.",
