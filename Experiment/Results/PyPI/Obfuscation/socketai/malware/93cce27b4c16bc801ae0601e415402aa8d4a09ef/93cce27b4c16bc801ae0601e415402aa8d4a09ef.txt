      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The package exhibits high obfuscation and executes an external, obscure function during installation, indicating a high potential for malicious behavior. The suspicious pattern justifies elevated malware and risk scores. Further investigation of the 'pre_install' module and the behavior of 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP' is strongly recommended before trusting or deploying this package."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external server using unsafe subprocess practices and obfuscated identifiers. The high malware score (approximately 0.9) and security risk score (around 0.9) are justified given the data exfiltration activity, unsafe command execution, and suspicious URL. The obfuscation further supports malicious intent. This code should be flagged as malicious or highly suspicious for further review or removal."
