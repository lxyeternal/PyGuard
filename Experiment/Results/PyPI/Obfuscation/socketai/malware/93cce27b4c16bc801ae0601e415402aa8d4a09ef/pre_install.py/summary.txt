  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external server using unsafe subprocess practices and obfuscated identifiers. The high malware score (approximately 0.9) and security risk score (around 0.9) are justified given the data exfiltration activity, unsafe command execution, and suspicious URL. The obfuscation further supports malicious intent. This code should be flagged as malicious or highly suspicious for further review or removal."
