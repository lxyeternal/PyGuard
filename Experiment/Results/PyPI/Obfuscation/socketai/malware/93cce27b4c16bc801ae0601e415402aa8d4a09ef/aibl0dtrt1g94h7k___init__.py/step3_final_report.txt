  "sinks": "Network connections, file system operations, system commands, or output streams.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to outputs or network destinations without suspicious transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports are based on descriptions rather than actual code snippets. They consistently identify no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. Confidence levels are high (0.6 to 0.9), and malware scores are zero, aligning with the benign assessments. Security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal threat. The evaluations are reasonable given the limited information, and no inconsistencies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided assessments are justified and consistent with the descriptions. The code appears benign with no signs of malware or obfuscation, and the security risk is very low. No further action or suspicion is warranted based on the available information.",
