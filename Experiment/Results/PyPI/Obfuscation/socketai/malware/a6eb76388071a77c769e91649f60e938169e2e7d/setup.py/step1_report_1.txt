{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be setting up a Python package, but includes an obfuscated command likely intended to run hidden PowerShell code.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment (os.path.exists) and executes a subprocess with a potentially malicious PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes obfuscated PowerShell code which may perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "os.path.exists check triggers subprocess.Popen with encoded command, which may perform hidden malicious activities.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated PowerShell command in subprocess call; use of try-except blocks with broad exception handling; absence of any legitimate reason for executing such encoded script during package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing setup from distutils and attempting to import subprocess and os. It checks for the existence of a specific file 'tahg'. If absent, it executes a subprocess with an encoded PowerShell command, likely malicious due to obfuscation and hidden execution. The command is encoded in base64, indicating an attempt to hide its purpose. The setup function is called with package metadata but in a broad try-except block that suppresses errors. The use of obfuscated code during setup suggests an attempt to run malicious payloads stealthily during installation or package handling.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated PowerShell code triggered during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The code aims to execute hidden commands, likely for malicious purposes, on the host system during installation. This behavior is suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
