  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, potentially with embedded malicious behavior to run hidden processes.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('tahg') check, subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing external command, checking for 'tahg' directory.",
  "flows": "Check if 'tahg' exists -> if not, execute encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command with hidden window style; the command appears to be obfuscated or encoded. The script runs a background process without user visibility. No visible input sources beyond filesystem check, but the encoded command is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to check for a directory named 'tahg'. If it doesn't exist, it runs a subprocess with a base64-encoded PowerShell command, hidden from user view. The encoding and hidden execution suggest an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The setup function is standard but combined with the encoded command indicates possible malicious intent. The second try block calls setup for package metadata, which is standard. The main concern is the encoded command execution, which could be used to perform malicious actions without user knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a hidden, encoded PowerShell command executed in the background, which is suspicious and indicates potential malicious activity. The package may attempt to run concealed scripts without user awareness, representing a security risk.",
