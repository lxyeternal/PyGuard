The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains low. Overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation, but the code itself appears benign."

Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment to confirm no hidden malicious functionalities."

The overall security posture remains low risk, with scores appropriately reflecting the minimal or ambiguous code context."
