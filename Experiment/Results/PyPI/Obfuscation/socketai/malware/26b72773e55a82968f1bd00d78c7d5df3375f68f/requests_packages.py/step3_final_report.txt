  "purpose": "To evaluate supply chain security risks and malicious behaviors in open source Python dependencies, identifying suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and potential malware indicators.",
  "sources": "Use of eval(), hardcoded strings, unused modules, complex control flow, environment variables, input reading functions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, dynamic code execution, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as eval() or input() to potentially malicious sinks like network or file operations, indicating malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval() on untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, unused modules, complex control flow, obfuscation hints, inconsistent scoring with code complexity.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets generally show benign behavior with straightforward logic, no suspicious patterns, and appropriate low scores for malware and obfuscation. Report 5 exhibits multiple red flags: use of eval(), hardcoded secrets, complex control flow, and obfuscation hints, justifying higher scores. The confidence levels align with the amount of context provided. Scores are consistent with the described behaviors, but for Report 5, increasing malware score from 0.3 to 0.5 better reflects the suspicious patterns. Overall, the assessments are reasonable, with minor adjustments to better match observed code features.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risks; Report 5 indicates potential malicious patterns warranting higher suspicion. Adjusting malware score for Report 5 to 0.5 improves accuracy. The overall evaluation remains consistent and justified.",
