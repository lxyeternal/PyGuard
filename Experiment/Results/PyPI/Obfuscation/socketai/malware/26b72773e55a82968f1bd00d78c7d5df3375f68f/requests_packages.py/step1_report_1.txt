  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or system interaction, but no specific purpose is clearly evident due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include environment variables, file reads, or network inputs, though none are explicitly shown in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or system commands, but specific sinks are not evident without further code.",
  "flows": "Without explicit source and sink points identified in the code, the data flow cannot be definitively mapped.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs are observed. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed step-by-step, but it contains no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. It uses standard Python features and libraries without suspicious patterns. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful actions are evident. Due to limited context, the assessment relies solely on visible code, which appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no indications of malware or malicious intent. It seems to perform standard operations with no security concerns identified within the provided snippet.",
