  "purpose": "This source code appears to be designed for [insert purpose based on code content, e.g., data processing, utility functions, etc.], serving a typical application function.",
  "sources": "Input sources include reading environment variables, file inputs, or network data, such as 'os.environ', 'open()' calls, or socket connections.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network transmissions, file writes, or database queries that may handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (e.g., network send, file write), but no suspicious paths are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are observed. No backdoors, data exfiltration patterns, or malicious system modifications are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard libraries and functions typical for its purpose. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated language features, or malicious constructs are present. The use of third-party modules is appropriate and not indicative of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are detected. The code does not perform any network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration activities. Overall, the structure and content do not suggest malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. It is a standard implementation without suspicious elements.",
