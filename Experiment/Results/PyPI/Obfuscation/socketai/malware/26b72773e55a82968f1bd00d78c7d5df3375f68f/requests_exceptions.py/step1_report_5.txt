  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and constants, mainly for error handling and potential code categorization.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions, local compatibility module, and class attributes/initializations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks of untrusted data or network communication detected.",
  "flows": "Class initializations and attribute assignments, primarily local, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names and attributes, extensive inheritance, and multiple layers of class definitions with seemingly random string constants. No actual malicious code like network activity, file manipulation, or credential handling is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple class definitions, many inheriting from each other or from imported exceptions. Class names and attribute names appear intentionally obfuscated, with random string constants assigned as class variables. The imports are from standard exception modules, with no unusual or suspicious imports. The classes themselves only initialize attributes with static string values, without executing any network or system commands. The structure and naming suggest possible obfuscation, but there are no clear signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be designed for error categorization or symbolic referencing, potentially part of a larger obfuscated codebase or a testing framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains heavily obfuscated class and attribute names with no evident malicious activity, data leaks, or network communications. The obfuscation could be for concealment or code protection, but no malicious behavior is detectable within this isolated fragment.",
