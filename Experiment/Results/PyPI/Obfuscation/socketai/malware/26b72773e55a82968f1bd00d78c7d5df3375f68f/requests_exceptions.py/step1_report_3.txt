{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define custom exception classes for error handling, potentially for a library or package dealing with HTTP and JSON operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class attributes, exception initialization parameters, and possibly external modules (import statements).",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or malicious actions within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "The flow involves initializing custom exception classes and passing data through class attributes and constructors without apparent external data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Several class attributes contain what look like random or obfuscated strings; code contains obfuscated import names and class attribute names that are not meaningful. No actual malicious code, such as network operations, file manipulation, or data exfiltration, is present.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines custom exception classes inheriting from existing exceptions. The class attributes contain arbitrary strings, possibly placeholders or obfuscated identifiers. Import statements import exceptions and compat modules with obfuscated names. There are no evident sources of untrusted data, nor are there any sinks or flows that could lead to malicious activity. The structure and content suggest possible obfuscation, but no malicious intent or harmful behavior is detectable within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily sets up exception classes with obfuscated attribute names, likely for internal error handling or as part of a larger, potentially obfuscated or generated codebase. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be intentionally obfuscated, but not malicious based on the content.",
