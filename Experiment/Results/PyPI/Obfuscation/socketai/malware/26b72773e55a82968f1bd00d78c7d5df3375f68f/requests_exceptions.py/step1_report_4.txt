{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and constants for error handling and warnings, likely in a larger package context.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and .compat modules; class attribute definitions; error and warning class initializations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external communication; no data leaks or malicious system effects observed.",
  "flows": "No evident data flows from sources to sinks; classes mainly define structure and constants without active data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated class names, random attribute names, and constants that resemble obfuscation. Import of an unusual exception alias from urllib3, but used in context. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of custom exception and warning class definitions with heavily obfuscated names and attributes. Imports include an exception from urllib3 and a compatibility class, but no active network, file, or input/output operations are present. The classes do not perform any data processing or security-sensitive actions. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly to hide trivial or benign definitions. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard class definitions with obfuscated naming, likely to mask simple exception structures. There is no evidence of malicious intent, external data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The use of obfuscation may suggest an attempt to hide trivial code or prevent easy analysis, but nothing malicious is evident.",
