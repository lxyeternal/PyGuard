{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes with obfuscated names, likely for error handling within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and class attributes, but does not process external input directly.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code assigns static strings to class attributes and stores parameters in object attributes, with no data flow leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation in import names, class names, attribute names, and static string constants; no meaningful identifiers, suggesting superficial obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated identifiers, importing from suspiciously named modules. There is no network activity, data processing, or code execution. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment rather than malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the low security risk score reflects the absence of active threats. The high obfuscation score is justified by naming patterns, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but benign. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are present in this fragment. The obfuscation may serve to conceal trivial or internal details, but it does not constitute a threat. Scores are consistent with this assessment.",
