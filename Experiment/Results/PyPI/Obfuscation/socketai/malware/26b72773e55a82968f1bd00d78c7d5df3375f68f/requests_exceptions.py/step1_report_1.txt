{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define custom exception classes and constants, likely for a Python package handling HTTP errors and JSON decoding errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and class attributes, but there are no user input or external data sources directly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include data sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code primarily sets up class hierarchies and constants without processing external untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated and nonsensical import names and attribute names, which could be an attempt to disguise intent. The class attributes are randomly named strings that seem meaningless and potentially malicious or obfuscated. No actual malicious activity or behavior is directly evident from the code itself.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions, with some classes adding class-level string constants. The imports are from suspiciously named modules, with obfuscated names, and the class attributes are random strings assigned to class variables. There is no indication of malicious actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The structure and naming could suggest obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious intent, but there is no direct evidence of such behavior within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be primarily structural, defining custom exceptions and constants, possibly with obfuscated names to hide true purpose. There is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual naming and structure could be suspicious but are not conclusive of malicious intent based solely on this code fragment.",
