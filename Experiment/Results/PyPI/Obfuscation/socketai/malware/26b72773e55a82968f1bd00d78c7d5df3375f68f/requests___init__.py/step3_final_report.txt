{
  "purpose": "The code provides documentation and usage examples for the Python requests library, illustrating GET and POST requests.",
  "sources": "No actual data input or external data sources; examples are static snippets.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; examples do not handle real input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely illustrative code snippets.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder or obfuscated strings such as 'r.twAMrptNmbQlDOKSXmcIwbqfcFrQxrKO' and 'requests.xQhxpUDUMoQUlpAZxfXcxqPCTVPTYzIW' which do not conform to standard naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are purely documentation with illustrative examples. The strange strings are likely placeholders or superficial obfuscation, not actual executable code. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. The obfuscation scores are high where placeholder strings are present, but this does not indicate malicious intent. Malware scores are zero, consistent with the absence of malicious activity. The security risk scores are minimal, reflecting the benign nature of the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, serving as documentation with superficial obfuscation. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present. The anomalies are placeholders rather than indicators of malicious code.",
