{
  "purpose": "Provides the default CA certificate bundle, relying on the certifi package, with instructions for packaging and environment-specific overrides.",
  "sources": "Comments referencing 'requests.certs' and 'certifi', no executable code present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "None; the code is primarily documentation and comments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of nonsensical, random strings such as 'yxqtFTtegPIEKkEPJLsYUqSJTYPSWIvg...' and 'GvQPpDtTWEAdejIhEDosNpBmgWFZReXp', suggesting obfuscation or corruption.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of descriptive comments about CA bundle handling, with no executable logic. The strange strings are suspicious and indicative of obfuscation or corruption but do not perform any malicious actions. No data flows or active code are present. The high obfuscation scores in the reports reflect these anomalies, but malware scores remain zero, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The security risk is negligible. The anomalies warrant further investigation but do not constitute active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily documentation with suspicious anomalies that are likely artifacts of obfuscation or corruption. There is no evidence of malware or active malicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the findings.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
