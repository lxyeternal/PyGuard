{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with custom test commands, manage dependencies, and perform some potentially malicious activities related to downloading and executing files from external sources on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the system's __file__ path, environment variables, and remote URLs ('http://52.14.229.35:1122/connect-CANDC.txt', 'http://52.14.229.35:1122/shoomsha.jpg').",
  "sinks": "Sinks include subprocess calls executing commands ('cmd /c move local_copy.txt local.bat', 'cmd /c local.bat', 'cmd /c del local.bat', 'cmd /c loc.bat'), and requests.get() downloads which are written to files and then executed via command shell.",
  "flows": "Code downloads files from remote servers, writes them locally, moves and executes them via command shell, then deletes the temporary batch files. Additionally, it checks for administrative permissions and network session status.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated variable names, executes external scripts and batch files downloaded from a remote server, and includes Windows-specific commands that could be used for malicious activities. The use of subprocess to execute downloaded content and the attempt to install requests dynamically is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a version check, includes a custom test command class, and manages dependencies. Notably, on Windows, it retrieves the temp directory, attempts to install 'requests' if missing, then downloads files from specific external URLs. These files are saved locally, moved, and executed as batch files. The code checks for 'Access is denied' when attempting to run 'net session' command, indicating an attempt to detect administrative privileges. The obfuscated variable names and external downloads combined with execution of remote files suggest malicious intent. The code's structure indicates it may be used for remote command execution, possibly to download and run arbitrary code or establish backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior, primarily due to its downloading and executing remote files, obfuscated variables, and Windows-specific commands that can be used to manipulate the system covertly. It appears designed to establish persistence or perform remote command execution. Overall, this package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
