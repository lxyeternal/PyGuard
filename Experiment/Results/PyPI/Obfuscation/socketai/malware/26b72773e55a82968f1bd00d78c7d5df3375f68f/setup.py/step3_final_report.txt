{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package, but on Windows systems, it performs malicious activities such as downloading remote files, executing them via subprocess, checking for admin privileges, and obfuscating its behavior to hide malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Remote URLs ('52.14.229.35' IPs), external requests, environment variables, version info, and obfuscated variables used during remote file fetches and system commands.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen calls executing downloaded scripts/batch files, file writes ('local.bat', 'local_copy.txt', etc.), system commands ('move', 'del'), and privilege checks ('net session').",
  "flows": "Code fetches remote content -> writes to files -> executes files via subprocess -> performs system modifications or privilege checks -> repeats with different URLs and files.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic installation of 'requests', remote IP addresses fetching payloads, execution of unverified remote scripts, and Windows-specific privilege checks.",
  "analysis": "The script performs version checks, installs dependencies, then on Windows, it fetches remote files from specific IPs, writes them as batch scripts, and executes them. It also checks for admin rights and attempts to download and run additional payloads, all while obfuscating variable names and using indirect system commands. These behaviors are characteristic of malware designed for remote control, persistence, or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, including remote payload delivery, execution, privilege escalation, and obfuscation. It should be classified as malicious with high confidence and considered a severe security threat.",
