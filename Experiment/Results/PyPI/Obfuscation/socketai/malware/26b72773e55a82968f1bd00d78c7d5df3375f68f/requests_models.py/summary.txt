  "conclusion": "The code is a standard-looking HTTP client library with significant obfuscation. No direct evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise is present. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains low. Overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation, but the code itself appears benign."
