{
  "purpose": "The code implements an HTTP client library with classes for request and response handling, URL parsing, stream decoding, header and cookie management, and request preparation.",
  "sources": "URL input strings, request headers, stream data, environment variables, and internal utils",
  "sinks": "Response content, request headers, URL components, and stream data",
  "flows": "Input URL and headers → URL parsing and validation → request preparation → response streaming and decoding",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and class names, internal modules with unclear or randomized names, complex internal utils",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex HTTP client with standard URL parsing, request setup, response streaming, and error handling. Obfuscated identifiers suggest potential concealment but no explicit malicious activity such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful payloads is evident. The obfuscation could be for proprietary or minification purposes. The low malware scores across reports are justified, and the high obfuscation scores reflect suspicion but not proof of malicious intent. The code appears legitimate but warrants cautious internal review due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard-looking HTTP client library with significant obfuscation. No direct evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise is present. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains low. Overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation, but the code itself appears benign.",
