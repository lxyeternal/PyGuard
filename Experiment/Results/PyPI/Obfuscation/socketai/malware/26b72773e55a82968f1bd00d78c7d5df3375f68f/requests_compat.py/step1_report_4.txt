{
  "purpose": "The code primarily sets up imports and type aliases for a larger module, likely related to HTTP requests and JSON processing.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as chardet/charset_normalizer, sys, json/simplejson, collections, http, urllib, and io; these are static imports and do not read untrusted data directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations like network requests, file writes, or command execution.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports modules and defines type aliases without processing external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable names and dynamic imports, which can be suspicious but may also be legitimate. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic are evident. The import structure seems designed to handle different environments or versions.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the presence of certain modules and imports alternative modules if necessary, based on environment conditions. It uses version checks to set flags, and defines type aliases for clarity. All operations are static imports and variable assignments without any network activity, data processing, or command execution. The obfuscated variable names do not correlate with malicious functionality but could hinder readability. Overall, this appears to be a preparatory or setup code for a larger package, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is primarily setup code with obfuscated variable names and dynamic imports. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks within this fragment. It appears to be a legitimate component of a larger package, with a low malware and security risk score.",
