  "purpose": "Setup and environment configuration for a Python package, including conditional imports and version checks.",
  "sources": "Module imports, version info checks, environment flags, and variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data flows to untrusted sinks; static import statements and variable assignments only.",
  "flows": "None active; code primarily initializes environment and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Superficial obfuscation via nonsensical variable names, reassignments of built-in types ('str', 'bytes'), and dynamic import fallback logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign setup routine with superficial obfuscation. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. Obfuscation appears intended to hinder analysis but does not indicate malicious intent. All import fallbacks and environment checks are standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment setup module with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned scores (malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0.7) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
