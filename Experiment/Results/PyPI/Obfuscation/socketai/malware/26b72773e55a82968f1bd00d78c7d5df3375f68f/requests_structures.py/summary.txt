  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated internal data utility with no signs of malware or malicious activity. Despite heavy obfuscation, it does not perform any harmful actions or external communications. The malware score should be set to 0, and the overall security risk remains low (~0.2). The obfuscation level is high, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent."
