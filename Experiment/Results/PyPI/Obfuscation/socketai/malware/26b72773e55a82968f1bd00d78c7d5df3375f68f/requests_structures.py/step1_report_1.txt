{
  "purpose": "Defines custom mapping and lookup classes, possibly for data storage and retrieval with case-insensitive keys.",
  "sources": "Input sources are class initializers (__init__), and __getitem__, __get__, and get methods accessing data structures like dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs occur via __repr__ methods, item retrieval (__getitem__), and copy method returning dictionary-like objects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through internal storage (__init__, __setitem__), and can be retrieved or inspected via __getitem__, __repr__, or copy methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-standard class and variable names, heavily obfuscated naming, and use of __dict__.get() in lookup class for potential indirect attribute access; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns found.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: one custom mapping with case-insensitive keys and ordered storage (kKwBDsomIUjbOQcBAppbalXVfoHLrioc), and another lookup class (nyHeXxoCvFOEIlTokXKwupPDxgFAqwss). The first class manages case-insensitive keys, storing original keys and associated values, with standard mapping methods implemented. The second class provides attribute-like lookup behavior via __dict__.get() and a customized __repr__. There are no network operations, no obfuscated logic, or code that interacts with environment variables, files, or network interfaces. The use of heavily obfuscated variable and class names seems to serve no clear purpose other than making the code harder to interpret. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious backdoors, or system interference activities are present. The code appears to be an obfuscated data storage and retrieval utility, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily an obfuscated implementation of data storage and lookup classes with case-insensitive keys. No malicious behavior, security risks, or malware signatures are evident. The obfuscation appears to be for complexity or concealment, but the logic itself is benign.",
