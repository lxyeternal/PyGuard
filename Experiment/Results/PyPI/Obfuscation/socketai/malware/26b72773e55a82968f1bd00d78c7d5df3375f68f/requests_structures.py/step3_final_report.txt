{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated classes implementing case-insensitive in-memory data storage and lookup, primarily for internal data management.",
  "sources": "Internal data structures, such as OrderedDict and __dict__.get() attribute access.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no external data input/output, network activity, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data is stored and retrieved within the class methods, with no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation via nonsensical class and variable names; use of __dict__.get() for attribute access; no external I/O or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom mapping classes managing case-insensitive keys and internal data lookup, with no network, file, or environment interactions. Obfuscation appears intended for concealment rather than malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of __dict__.get() is unusual but benign in this context. The code's purpose seems to be internal data handling, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated internal data utility with no signs of malware or malicious activity. Despite heavy obfuscation, it does not perform any harmful actions or external communications. The malware score should be set to 0, and the overall security risk remains low (~0.2). The obfuscation level is high, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
