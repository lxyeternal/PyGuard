{
  "purpose": "Minimal module declaration exporting 'collored' and importing 'init' from a local module.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data flows, or data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only declares and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in '__all__' as 'collored' instead of 'colored'; module name 'collored' is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, with a likely accidental typo in '__all__'. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The import is a straightforward relative import. No data leaks, network activity, or code injection present. The typo does not pose security risks but could cause runtime issues if misused.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with a harmless typo. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The scores should reflect very low security risk and malware likelihood, with a slight concern for the typo's potential to cause runtime issues.",
