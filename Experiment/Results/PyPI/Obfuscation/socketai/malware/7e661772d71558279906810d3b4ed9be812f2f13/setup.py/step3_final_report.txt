  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that changes directory to the parent directory of the current file and calls setup() with static metadata.",
  "sources": "os.PWEfxnDjWwdYOiMsoTdsgQBJDqZLYYjc (obfuscated attribute), __file__ for path determination",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no network or data exfiltration observed",
  "flows": "Directory path construction via os.PWEfxnDjWwdYOiMsoTdsgQBJDqZLYYjc.join -> os.PWEfxnDjWwdYOiMsoTdsgQBJDqZLYYjc.abspath -> os.PWEfxnDjWwdYOiMsoTdsgQBJDqZLYYjc.normpath, then os.chdir",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated attribute names like os.PWEfxnDjWwdYOiMsoTdsgQBJDqZLYYjc, malformed code in report 5 (e.g., os.PWEfxnDjWwdYOiMsoTdsgQBJDqZLYYjc.normpath), unusual variable naming",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated or nonsensical attribute names that do not exist in the standard os module, likely obfuscation or typo. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscation appears superficial or accidental, not malicious. The malformed code in report 5 suggests possible corruption or obfuscation but no active malicious behavior. Overall, the code's intent is benign, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup configuration with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malicious activity or security risks has been detected. The obfuscation is suspicious but likely non-malicious; further verification of the attribute names is recommended.",
