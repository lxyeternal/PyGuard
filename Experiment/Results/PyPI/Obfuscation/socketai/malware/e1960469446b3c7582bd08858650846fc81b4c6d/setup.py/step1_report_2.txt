  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command with hidden window, no error handling for subprocess failure, no explanation for the command's purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup tools and attempting to import subprocess and os modules. It checks whether the directory 'tahg' exists; if not, it executes a PowerShell command encoded in base64 via subprocess.Popen with a hidden window. The PowerShell command is encoded, which suggests obfuscation. The setup() function is called to define package metadata. The use of try-except blocks with silent failure indicates a desire to suppress errors. The encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, appears to perform some network or file operations (though the actual command is base64-encoded and not directly readable). The overall structure shows intent to run potentially hidden commands during setup, which is suspicious. The code does not reveal why the PowerShell command is executed or what it does, raising concerns about malicious activity, especially since it is encoded and executed without user knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary suspicious element is the encoded PowerShell command executed silently during setup. This behavior, combined with the lack of explanation and use of hidden execution, suggests potential malicious intent or malicious obfuscation. The rest of the code appears standard for a setup script, but the embedded command warrants caution.",
