  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads README.md and configures package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, static metadata variables, package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external calls; static setup configuration.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md into a variable, passing variables to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, which are unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation is superficial and likely intended to hide variable purposes, not malicious intent. The static dependencies and configuration are standard. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated high, low security risk) are consistent with the code's content. No active malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The high obfuscation score reflects variable name obfuscation but does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall security risk is very low.",
