  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, home directory, current working directory), encodes it in JSON and base64, and transmits it via an HTTP GET request to an external URL with obfuscated variable names and suppressed error handling, indicating covert data exfiltration.",

  "anomalies": [
    "Use of broad exception handling that suppresses errors",
    "Obfuscated variable names",
    "Custom Host header pointing to suspicious domain",
    "Sending data to a non-standard PyPI URL",
    "Silent data exfiltration without user notification"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script gathers system info, encodes it, and transmits it covertly to an external server, indicating potential data theft. The use of obfuscation, suppressed errors, and suspicious headers suggest malicious intent. No malicious payloads like reverse shells or malware are present, but the behavior aligns with covert surveillance or exfiltration activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration of system information, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. While no active malware payloads are detected, the behavior warrants high security concern due to privacy and data security risks.",
