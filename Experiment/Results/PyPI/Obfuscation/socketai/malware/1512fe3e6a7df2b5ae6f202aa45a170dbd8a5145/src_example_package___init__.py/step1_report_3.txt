  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, user directory, current directory) and send it encoded to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading system information via os.uname, os.path.expanduser, and os.getcwd",
  "sinks": "Sending data via an HTTP request to an external server ('https://pypi.org/reqs?d=...')",
  "flows": "System info → JSON serialization → Base64 encoding → HTTP request to external domain",
  "anomalies": "Use of a try-except that suppresses errors, obfuscation through base64 encoding, and unusual endpoint URL ('pypi.org/reqs') which is a common masquerade for malicious data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system details and encodes them with base64 before sending them via a GET request to a seemingly legitimate URL, but the URL ('pypi.org/reqs?d=...') is suspicious as it does not match the standard PyPI endpoints and appears to be used for data exfiltration. The use of a try-except block that suppresses errors could hide failures or malicious activity. The code could be part of a malicious supply chain attack, collecting user environment info without consent and transmitting it to an external server.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform data exfiltration of system information under the guise of legitimate package communication. Although it uses common libraries and benign-looking URL obfuscation, the intent to send environment details to an external server is suspicious and could be malicious.",
