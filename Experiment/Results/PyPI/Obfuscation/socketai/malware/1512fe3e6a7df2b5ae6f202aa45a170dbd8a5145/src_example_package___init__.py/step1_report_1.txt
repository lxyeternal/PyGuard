  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it encoded to a remote server via a GET request.",
  "sources": "os.uname(), os.path.expanduser('~'), os.getcwd() - read system info and current directory.",
  "sinks": "request.urlopen() - sending data to remote URL.",
  "flows": "Gather system info -> encode data -> append to URL -> send request.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling, obfuscated variable names, and data exfiltration without explicit user consent or notification.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system details such as OS info, home directory, and current working directory, encodes this information in base64, and sends it to an external URL (https://pypi.org/reqs?d=...). The code employs a custom function with try-except to suppress errors. The URL endpoint and the request headers suggest possible data exfiltration rather than typical package functionality. No evidence of malicious payloads like reverse shells, malware, or backdoors is present, but the data collection and transmission behavior are suspicious and could be used for tracking or privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to collect and transmit system information covertly, which is suspicious behavior typical of data exfiltration scripts. No definitive malware functions detected, but the data leakage nature warrants caution.",
