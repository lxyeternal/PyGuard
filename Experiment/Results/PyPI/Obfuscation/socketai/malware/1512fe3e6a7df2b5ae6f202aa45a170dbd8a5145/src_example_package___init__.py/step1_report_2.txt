  "sinks": "request.urlopen to send data to external URL",
  "flows": "os.uname, os.path.expanduser, os.getcwd -> JSON encoding -> base64 encoding -> HTTP request to external server",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation of data encoding, use of try-except without logging, unusual URL 'https://pypi.org/reqs?d=' used to exfiltrate data, headers set to mimic a different host",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to execute functions safely. It collects system info: hostname, user directory, and current directory, then encodes this info in JSON and base64 formats. It constructs an HTTP GET request to an external URL with this encoded data as a query parameter. The request headers specify a different host, possibly to disguise the data exfiltration. The use of try-except suppresses errors silently, indicating obfuscation or concealment. The request is sent without validation or checks, potentially for covert data exfiltration or surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for covertly collecting and transmitting system information to an external server, which indicates malicious intent. The obfuscation and data exfiltration behavior suggest this could be malicious activity aimed at surveillance or data theft.",
