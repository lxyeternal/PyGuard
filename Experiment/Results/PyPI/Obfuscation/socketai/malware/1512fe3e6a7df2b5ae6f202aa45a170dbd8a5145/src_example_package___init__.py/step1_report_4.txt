  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, home directory, current working directory), encode it, and send it via an HTTP request to an external server.",

  "flows": "os.uname/os.path.expanduser/os.getcwd -> JSON encoding -> Base64 encoding -> HTTP request URL -> request.urlopen (sending data to external server)",
  "anomalies": "The code silently catches exceptions in the custom function, which could hide errors. The request URL ('https://pypi.org/reqs?d=') appears to be a legitimate domain but is used here to exfiltrate encoded system info. The request headers include a suspicious 'Host' header ('psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net') that may be misleading.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a wrapper function to execute system calls safely, retrieving system info like hostname, home directory, and current directory. This info is serialized into JSON, base64-encoded, and then sent as a GET request parameter to an external URL. The custom 'Host' header points to an unusual domain that might be used for covert data exfiltration. The code does not perform any visible malicious actions but is designed to silently collect and transmit sensitive system data, which is suspicious and indicative of potential data exfiltration behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script covertly gathers sensitive system information and exfiltrates it to an external server, which is suspicious behavior consistent with data theft or spying activity. While there is no immediate evidence of destructive malware, this behavior is malicious in nature, indicating possible misuse.",
