  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or functionality defined by the module, but without additional context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user inputs, or external files. Specific source points are not explicitly visible in the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or command execution based on the use of libraries and functions invoked within the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network sockets, files, or system commands, possibly via intermediate processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or malicious code snippets are present. The code does not appear obfuscated or intentionally complex. However, without full context, some dynamic evaluations or indirect calls could pose concerns.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain obvious malicious payloads such as network exfiltration, reverse shells, or data theft mechanisms. It utilizes standard libraries and typical programming constructs. No suspicious patterns or backdoors are evident. The absence of specific input/output points makes detection of malicious data flows difficult, but based on the visible code, there are no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears benign with no clear signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It seems to perform standard operations without security risks or malware indications. Confidence is moderate, as full context might reveal additional risks, but based on this fragment, it is considered safe.",
