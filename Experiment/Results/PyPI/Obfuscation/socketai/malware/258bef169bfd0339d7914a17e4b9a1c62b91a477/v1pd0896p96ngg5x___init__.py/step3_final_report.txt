  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "No code provided; potential data sources include environment variables, file I/O, network connections (if code existed).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, or system modifications (if code existed).",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks is indeterminate due to missing code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code prevents detection of anomalies; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly note the absence or incompleteness of code, leading to low confidence in identifying malicious activity. The scores assigned are consistent with the limited information, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero. Confidence scores could be slightly lowered in some reports to reflect the lack of concrete code, and security risk scores could be marginally reduced from 0.2 to 0.1 to better match the evidence. Overall, the cautious assessments are appropriate given the circumstances.",
  "conclusion": "No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation is present due to missing code. The assessments are accurate and conservative, with scores aligning with the available information. Slight adjustments to confidence and risk scores are recommended but not mandatory.",
