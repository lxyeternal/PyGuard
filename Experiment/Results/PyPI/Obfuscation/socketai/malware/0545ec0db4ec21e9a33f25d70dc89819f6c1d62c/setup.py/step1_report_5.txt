{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package and execute a background PowerShell command, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the filesystem to check for the existence of 'tahg', and executes a subprocess running a PowerShell command encoded in Base64.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command with hidden window style, which can lead to covert execution of malicious payloads or commands.",
  "flows": "Checks if 'tahg' exists -> If not, runs the PowerShell command -> PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an encoded PowerShell command that is run with no window and without explicit validation. The 'subprocess.Popen' is invoked with suspicious parameters and obfuscated command. The code silently ignores errors.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing 'distutils.core.setup' solely for package setup, which is benign. It then attempts to import 'subprocess' and 'os' modules. If the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command encoded in Base64 via 'subprocess.Popen' with hidden window flags, potentially executing malicious payloads covertly. The PowerShell command appears encoded, which is common for obfuscated malicious scripts. The setup call is typical but the preceding command execution is suspicious and indicates possible malicious activity. The script catches exceptions silently, preventing detection of errors or failures.",
  "conclusion": "The code combines benign package setup with suspicious background execution of an encoded PowerShell command, which is likely malicious. The use of obfuscation and hidden execution suggests intent to perform malicious actions covertly. The overall risk is high.",
