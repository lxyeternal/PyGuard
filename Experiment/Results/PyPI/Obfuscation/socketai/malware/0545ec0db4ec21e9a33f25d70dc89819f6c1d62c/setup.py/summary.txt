  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup, with mechanisms to conceal errors and evade detection. It should be treated as potentially malicious until the encoded command is decoded and verified. The risk and malware scores are justified and should be considered high."
