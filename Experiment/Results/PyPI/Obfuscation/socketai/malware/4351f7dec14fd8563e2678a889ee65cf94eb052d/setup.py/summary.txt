  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command triggered conditionally, with silent error handling. While the payload is not decoded, the behavior aligns with common malicious tactics such as backdoors or remote code execution. The high scores reflect this risk, and further decoding of the payload is recommended for definitive assessment."
