{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with an embedded malicious payload that attempts to send system hostname and IP address to a Discord webhook during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname()",
  "sinks": "Discord webhook via aiohttp.ClientSession and Webhook.send()",
  "flows": "The code reads hostname and IP address, then sends this data to a remote Discord webhook during the install process",
  "anomalies": "Embedded asynchronous function that leaks system info to external server; suspicious use of import inside a custom install class; code execution triggered during package installation rather than normal setup",
  "analysis": "The script extends the 'install' command of setuptools, overriding a method that runs during installation. Inside this method, it imports potentially malicious modules ('discord', 'aiohttp'), gathers system hostname and IP, and asynchronously sends this info to a specific Discord webhook URL. The code is obfuscated by non-descriptive class and function names, and the payload's purpose is hidden behind standard setup boilerplate. This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate system info stealthily when the package is installed, which is malicious. The code does not perform any other legitimate setup functions besides the malicious payload.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it exfiltrates system information to an external Discord webhook during installation. This is a malicious supply chain attack embedded within a setup script, indicating high security risk.",
