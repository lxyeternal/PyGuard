{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to perform package setup and installation, but it includes malicious activity by exfiltrating system hostname and IP address via a Discord webhook during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname()",
  "sinks": "Discord webhook URL via aiohttp.ClientSession() and Webhook.send()",
  "flows": "During the install process, hostname and IP address are gathered and sent asynchronously to a remote Discord webhook",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code structure with obfuscated class and function names, the inclusion of a Discord webhook that transmits system info during installation, use of asynchronous code within setup class",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools but defines a custom install class that overrides the run method (named oddly) to include malicious code. Inside this method, it collects hostname and IP address, then asynchronously sends this info to a Discord webhook URL. The code is obfuscated with nonsensical class and function names. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the code executes during package installation, which is highly suspicious. The core malicious behavior is the exfiltration of system data without user consent, indicating potential privacy violations and malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by secretly sending system hostname and IP address to an external Discord webhook during package installation. This indicates an attempt to exfiltrate user system information covertly. The obfuscation and hidden data transmission strongly suggest malicious intent.",
