{
  "purpose": "Custom setup script that installs a Python package and executes code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and executes an asynchronous function during the install process, which contains network activity.",
  "sinks": "The asynchronous function sends data (hostname and IP address) to a Discord webhook, potentially leaking system information.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code retrieves hostname and IP, then sends this data to an external Discord webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Code executes network requests during installation without user consent, using obfuscated class and function names, and hardcoded webhook URL. The code appears to be designed to exfiltrate system information.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the standard installation process by defining a custom install command. Inside the custom command, it imports modules including discord, aiohttp, and asyncio, then defines a function that collects hostname and IP address, and sends this data to a specified Discord webhook. The function is invoked during the installation phase, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. The code's variable names are obfuscated, and the webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating potential malicious intent to exfiltrate data during package installation. This behavior resembles malicious supply chain activity by harvesting system info.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by exfiltrating system hostname and IP address via a webhook during package installation. Its obfuscated naming and network activity without user knowledge suggest an intent to secretly collect and send data, constituting a security risk.",
