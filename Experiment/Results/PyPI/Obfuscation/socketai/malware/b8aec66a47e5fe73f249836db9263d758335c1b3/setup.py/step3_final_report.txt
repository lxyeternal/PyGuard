{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate system hostname and IP address during package installation by sending this data to a Discord webhook, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname)",
  "sinks": "Webhook.from_url() and the await send() method, which transmit data over the network to an external server",
  "flows": "The code retrieves hostname and IP, then asynchronously sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook during the installation process",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, import statements inside the install method, execution of network activity during setup, hardcoded webhook URL",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that overrides the run method, within which it imports modules, collects hostname and IP address, and asynchronously sends this data to a specified Discord webhook. The obfuscated naming and network activity during installation are suspicious. The code's behavior aligns with malicious exfiltration rather than legitimate setup tasks. The network request is executed during package installation, which is unusual and indicative of malicious intent. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and obfuscation further support malicious activity. The activity is stealthy, potentially compromising user privacy and system security.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior involving stealthy data exfiltration during package installation. It uses obfuscation and hardcoded webhooks to hide its intent. The activity is consistent with supply chain sabotage, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
