{
  "purpose": "Customize the install process to include a malicious activity that sends system information to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), import statements, Webhook URL",
  "sinks": "Webhook.send() function which transmits hostname and IP address",
  "flows": "The code collects hostname and IP address, then sends this data to a remote Discord webhook during installation",
  "anomalies": "Use of random class and function names, obfuscated variable names, inclusion of suspicious webhook, sending system info during package install",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command class that, during package installation, imports modules including discord and socket, collects system hostname and IP address, and sends this data to a remote Discord webhook. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the activity occurs within the overridden install command's method. The obfuscated class and method names, combined with the data exfiltration during installation, strongly indicate malicious intent aimed at user tracking or system reconnaissance without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior designed to exfiltrate system information during installation via a hidden webhook. This behavior is malicious, clandestine, and intended for surveillance or unauthorized data collection.",
