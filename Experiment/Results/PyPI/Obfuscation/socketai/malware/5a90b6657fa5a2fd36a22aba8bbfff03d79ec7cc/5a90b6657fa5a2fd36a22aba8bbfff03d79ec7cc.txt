      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution during package setup. The high obfuscation and stealth tactics justify elevated malware and risk scores. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious payloads, but current evidence warrants treating this as a high-risk, potentially malicious package."
