  "conclusion": "The code functions as a wallet-stealing malware, exfiltrating sensitive files and system information via Telegram with obfuscation and hardcoded secrets. Despite minor code inconsistencies, the malicious intent is evident, and the scores assigned in the reports are justified. The overall security risk is high, and the code should be classified as malicious malware."
