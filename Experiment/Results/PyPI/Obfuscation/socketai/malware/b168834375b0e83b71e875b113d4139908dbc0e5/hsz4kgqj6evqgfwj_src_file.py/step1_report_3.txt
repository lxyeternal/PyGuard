{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect sensitive user data from local files and environment variables, package them into a zip archive, and exfiltrate the data via Telegram bot API, potentially for malicious purposes such as wallet theft or data leakage.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), system username, and local file paths containing wallet and configuration data. Network input is from IP and country code requests to external APIs.",
  "sinks": "Data is written into a zip file stored locally and then sent over the network to Telegram API endpoints using the bot token and chat ID, including the entire zip file as a document.",
  "flows": "Data from local files and environment variables is collected and compressed into a zip archive. The code then retrieves IP and country info, encodes the country code into emojis, and sends a message along with the zip file to a Telegram chat, potentially revealing sensitive information.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; multiple file paths related to cryptocurrency wallets; collection of user data and system info; attempts to hide data exfiltration by encoding country info; no user consent or transparency; usage of environment variables and file access for sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by retrieving the system username, which it incorrectly references as 'username' (undefined variable), indicating a bug or obfuscation. It sets up paths to sensitive wallet and config files, then checks for their existence. If found, it packages these files into a zip archive. It then gathers system IP and country info, encodes the country code into emojis, and prepares a message containing this info. The zip file and info are exfiltrated to a Telegram bot via API calls. The code's obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, data collection from sensitive files, and network transmission strongly suggest malicious intent, primarily data theft and exfiltration without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious, exhibiting behavior typical of malware designed to steal cryptocurrency wallet data, system info, and exfiltrate it via Telegram. It leverages obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, and unauthorized data access. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered malicious.",
