  "purpose": "The code appears to collect various wallet and configuration files related to Exodus wallet on Windows systems, package them into a zip file, and exfiltrate system information and the zip file to a remote server, possibly for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser(), environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), file existence checks, and reading specific wallet/config files from user directories.",
  "sinks": "Writing wallet/config files into a zip archive, sending system information and files via HTTP POST requests to a Telegram bot API.",
  "flows": "The code gathers system and wallet data (sources), packages files into a zip archive, and then exfiltrates the data to a remote server via network requests (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, conditional on existence of wallet files, concatenation of potentially sensitive file paths, and IP/geolocation data retrieval. The code also attempts to exfiltrate user data without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by defining a function with an obfuscated name. It retrieves the current username and environment variables for common app data directories. It constructs paths to Exodus wallet and config files, then checks if any of these files exist. If found, it packages them into a zip file, appending a message with the username and a flag. The code then fetches the system's IP address and country code, encodes the IP into a regional flag emoji, and replaces a placeholder in the message. It then sends the compiled message and the zip file to a Telegram bot via HTTP POST requests, effectively exfiltrating sensitive data. The presence of hardcoded Telegram tokens, the collection of wallet files, and network transmission indicate malicious intent, likely for wallet theft or system reconnaissance. The code uses obfuscated variable names and handles exceptions silently, which further suggests malicious or clandestine behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a wallet and system data stealer, packaging sensitive files and transmitting them to an attacker-controlled Telegram bot. It exhibits typical characteristics of malware aimed at exfiltrating user data without consent. The overall risk score is high, and the package should be considered malicious.",
