{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect and archive sensitive user data related to a cryptocurrency wallet, including wallet files and configurations, then exfiltrate this data over the internet. It also gathers system IP and location information, and uploads data via Telegram bot API.",
  "sources": "User input/data sources include environment variables (e.g., 'LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA', 'TEMP'), and system files containing wallet data and sensitive information. External requests to retrieve IP info and send data to Telegram servers are also sources.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to a ZIP archive, then sent as a document via Telegram API. System files and wallet data are included in the archive, which could leak sensitive information. HTTP requests to external servers are used to exfiltrate data.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data from wallet files and user environment variables are collected, written into a ZIP file, then uploaded via Telegram API. IP and location info are retrieved and appended to the report before exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs obfuscated variable names, performs collection of potentially sensitive wallet and configuration files, and exfiltrates data to a Telegram bot, indicating malicious intent. The use of environment variables and system paths without validation suggests data theft. The code is designed to operate covertly, and the function name appears intentionally obfuscated. It uses dynamic URL calls and hidden data exfiltration methods.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the current user's username, environment variables for system paths, and constructs file paths to various wallet-related files, including wallet configs, seed, passphrase, and two-factor secrets. It checks for existence of specific files associated with the Exodus wallet, indicating targeting of this wallet. If such files exist, it creates a ZIP archive containing these files, appends a message with system info, and attempts to exfiltrate the ZIP via Telegram bot API, including IP and geolocation info. It also encodes the IP address into Unicode characters, further obfuscating the exfiltration data. The overall structure and obfuscated variable names strongly suggest malicious intent to steal wallet data and send it to an attacker-controlled Telegram bot.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, acting as a wallet stealer targeting Exodus wallet files. It covertly collects sensitive files, archives them, and exfiltrates the data via Telegram. It also gathers system IP and location info, embedding it into the report. The obfuscation and malicious data theft indicate high threat level.",
