  "purpose": "The code appears to collect user and system information, potentially sensitive files, and send them to a remote server or Telegram bot, likely for malicious data exfiltration or surveillance.",
  "sources": [
    "getpass.getuser() to obtain current username",
    "Environment variables 'LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA', 'TEMP'",
    "File existence checks and file reads for user data and wallet info",
    "HTTP GET requests to 'http://ip-api.com' to obtain IP and country info",

  "flows": [
    "User/system info collection -> file creation and zipping -> upload via Telegram API",
    "System info (IP, country) -> message formatting -> sending to Telegram",
    "Sensitive files -> compression -> network transmission"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of obfuscated variable names and function names",
    "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat IDs",
    "Unusual concatenation of user paths and sensitive filenames",
    "Repetitive exception handling without specific error logging",
    "Code to collect and exfiltrate potentially sensitive wallet and config files",
    "Encoding system info as Unicode characters and appending to message",
    "Use of environment variables and file paths suggestive of wallet theft"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing modules for user identification, environment access, file handling, and HTTP requests. It defines a function that gathers the current username and environment variables related to user directories. It constructs file paths targeting specific wallet, config, and data files, then checks their existence. If any such files are found, it creates a zip archive and writes these files into it, handling exceptions silently. The code retrieves the system's IP address and country code from an external API, encodes the country code into Unicode characters, and inserts this info into a message template. It then sends a message and the zip archive to a Telegram bot, using hardcoded bot token and chat ID, and deletes the zip after transmission. The pattern suggests data exfiltration of wallet and user files, likely malicious, especially given the focus on wallet directories and private info.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to stealthily collect sensitive user and wallet data, compress it, and exfiltrate it via Telegram. Its obfuscated variable names, hardcoded credentials, and focus on wallet files indicate malicious intent likely aimed at theft or surveillance.",
