{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect sensitive user data, including wallet information, and exfiltrate it via encrypted ZIP files and Telegram messaging.",
  "sources": "User input via getpass.getuser(), environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), and external HTTP requests for IP info.",
  "sinks": "Writing files to user directories, creating ZIP archives, sending data via Telegram API (bot token and chat ID), and HTTP requests to external services.",
  "flows": "User data is read from environment variables and files, then compressed into ZIP archives, and finally sent over the network through Telegram API calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, creation of ZIP files with potentially sensitive data, and the collection of wallet and config files from specific directories. Also, use of string concatenation for paths, suspicious IP geolocation fetching, and the final upload of data to Telegram are indicative of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing modules and defining a function with obfuscated naming. It retrieves the current username and several environment variables pointing to user directories. It constructs paths to sensitive wallet and configuration files related to 'exodus', a cryptocurrency wallet. If these files exist, it creates a ZIP archive and attempts to add these files to it, catching exceptions silently. It appends descriptive labels to a status string, indicating data collection. If certain files are present, it collects IP geolocation info, encodes country code into emojis, and replaces a placeholder with this info. It then uses hardcoded Telegram API tokens and chat IDs to send a message and the ZIP document containing the collected files. Finally, it cleans up by deleting the ZIP file. The obfuscation, targeted wallet files, network exfiltration via Telegram, and IP geolocation data all point towards malicious behavior intended to steal sensitive wallet data and transmit it covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to silently collect and exfiltrate sensitive wallet and user data via Telegram. It uses obfuscation and hardcoded tokens to hide its true intent. The code poses a high security risk and should be considered malicious malware.",
