{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to covertly collect sensitive wallet files and system information, package them into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrate them via Telegram API using hardcoded credentials. It also retrieves IP and geolocation data, encodes it, and sends it along with the files, indicating malicious intent to steal wallet data.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), user directories, specific wallet and configuration files related to Exodus wallet, external IP and geolocation APIs.",
  "sinks": "ZIP archive files stored temporarily, Telegram API endpoints for sending messages and documents, deletion of ZIP files after exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Detection of wallet files and system info in sources → packaging into ZIP archive → exfiltration via Telegram API → deletion of local ZIP file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable and function names, hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat IDs, reliance on external IP API, encoding of country code into Unicode characters, referencing undefined variable 'username'.",
  "analysis": "The code is obfuscated with nonsensical variable names, targeting specific wallet files in user directories. It checks for their existence, then packages them into a ZIP archive. It retrieves external IP and country info, encodes the country code into Unicode characters, and sends both a message and the ZIP archive via Telegram API using hardcoded credentials. The code silently handles exceptions, typical of malware. The use of undefined 'username' suggests either obfuscation or incomplete code, but the core malicious behavior remains clear. The code exfiltrates sensitive wallet data, system info, and IP details covertly, confirming malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a wallet-stealing malware, exfiltrating sensitive files and system information via Telegram with obfuscation and hardcoded secrets. Despite minor code inconsistencies, the malicious intent is evident, and the scores assigned in the reports are justified. The overall security risk is high, and the code should be classified as malicious malware.",
