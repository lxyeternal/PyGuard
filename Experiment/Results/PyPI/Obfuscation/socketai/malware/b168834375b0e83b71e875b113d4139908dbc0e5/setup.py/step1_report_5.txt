  "sources": "Reading package name, version, classifiers, and the unusual variable 'eiFKEdtNeUGyTPrifJezqJBTUJuHkAjG='.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into insecure operations or leaks.",
  "flows": "The variable 'eiFKEdtNeUGyTPrifJezqJBTUJuHkAjG=' is assigned a string but not used elsewhere, so no data flow to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a nonsensical variable 'eiFKEdtNeUGyTPrifJezqJBTUJuHkAjG=' assigned to 'text/markdown'. The variable name appears obfuscated or randomly generated. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It defines package metadata with a random string variable that is not used anywhere else, indicating possible obfuscation or placeholder. No malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code seems legitimate in function but suspicious due to the meaningless variable.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script with an obfuscated variable, likely a placeholder or formatting mistake. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
