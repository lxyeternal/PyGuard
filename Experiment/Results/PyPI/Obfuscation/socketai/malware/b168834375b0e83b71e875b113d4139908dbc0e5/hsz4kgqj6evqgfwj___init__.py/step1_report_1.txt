    "Use of wildcard imports (*) which can lead to namespace pollution and obscure code origins",

  ],
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a local module 'src_file' and the 'colorama' package, which is common for console color handling. The function 'AkaZRlGQjVIqeitKqceyYidozfYNwsXp()' is called immediately after import, but is not defined within this snippet. The function name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, raising suspicion. The code structure is minimal but includes obfuscated elements and immediate execution, which are common in malicious or maliciously obfuscated code. There are no visible security issues like hardcoded credentials or malicious network activity, but the obfuscation and immediate function call are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscated characteristics and immediate execution of an undefined function, which raises suspicion of malicious intent or obfuscation. The use of wildcard imports reduces clarity and could hide malicious behavior. While no direct malicious actions are evident, the pattern is suspicious and warrants further investigation of the function's definition and overall context.",
