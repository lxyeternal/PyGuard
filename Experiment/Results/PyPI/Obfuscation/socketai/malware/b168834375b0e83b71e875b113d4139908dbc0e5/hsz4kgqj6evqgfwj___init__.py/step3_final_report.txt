{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module 'src_file' and the 'colorama' library, then immediately executes an obfuscated function 'AkaZRlGQjVIqeitKqceyYidozfYNwsXp()'.",
  "sources": "Input source is the imported modules 'src_file' and 'colorama'. The function call is an execution sink.",
  "sinks": "The function 'AkaZRlGQjVIqeitKqceyYidozfYNwsXp()' may perform actions based on its implementation; potential sinks include network activity, file modifications, or other system effects if malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported modules into the execution context; the function call is a direct source-to-sink flow if the function performs malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports obscures symbol origins; immediate execution of an obfuscated function without context; lack of explicit imports or comments; the function name appears nonsensical or autogenerated.",
  "analysis": "The code pattern involves wildcard imports from a local module and a third-party library, which can hide malicious or unintended behavior. The immediate invocation of an obfuscated function raises suspicion, especially without visibility into its implementation. The pattern of such obfuscation and immediate execution is common in malicious scripts or obfuscated code, but it is not definitive proof of malicious intent. The lack of network activity, hardcoded credentials, or other malicious indicators in this snippet limits certainty. The suspicion is primarily based on obfuscation and execution pattern, warranting further investigation into the contents of 'src_file' and the function's code.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns typical of obfuscated or potentially malicious scripts, primarily due to the nonsensical function name, wildcard imports, and immediate execution. While not conclusively malicious, these elements warrant further analysis to confirm or dismiss malicious intent.",
