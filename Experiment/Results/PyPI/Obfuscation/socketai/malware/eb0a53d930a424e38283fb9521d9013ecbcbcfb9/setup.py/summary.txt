  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious malware aimed at stealing user credentials, cookies, tokens, and system information, then exfiltrating this data covertly. Its obfuscation, process termination, and data encryption routines confirm its malicious intent. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified, reflecting the severe security threat posed by this script."
