{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malware or malicious data collection tool, likely designed to steal sensitive user information, including cookies, passwords, tokens, and other credentials, and exfiltrate this data via webhooks or upload links. It also seems to perform reconnaissance on installed browsers, Discord relationships, and other user data.",
  "sources": "URL requests to external servers, environment variables, local file system paths, reading from browser storage and local state files, log and database files, token extraction via regex, and environment variables for system paths.",
  "sinks": "Requests to Discord webhooks, POST requests with stolen data, file uploads, and execution of external processes (e.g., killing processes, creating ZIP files). Data exfiltration is achieved through requests and uploads to transfer.sh.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from system environment variables, browser data, and logs; tokens and credentials are extracted and validated; then, data is packaged into JSON or strings and sent to external servers via webhooks or uploads. Certain functions decrypt stored passwords or tokens before exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded webhook URL, suspicious environment variable use, extensive regex for token extraction, process termination commands, dynamic imports and package installation, obfuscated variable names, and functions that appear to steal cookies, passwords, and browser data. The code also attempts to evade detection by threading and multiple exfiltration methods.",
  "analysis": "The script is a sophisticated stealer targeting browsers, Discord, crypto wallets, and other sensitive applications. It uses environment variables to locate data paths, decrypts stored credentials, and exfiltrates data via Discord webhooks and file upload services. The code structure suggests obfuscation with dynamic import, process killing, and multi-threaded operations to avoid detection. It gathers system info, user tokens, cookies, passwords, and possibly more. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL indicates malicious intent, as it is used for data exfiltration. The code’s design is typical of information-stealing malware, with multiple evasion tactics and data exfiltration channels.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious malware designed to harvest sensitive user data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, and personal information from browsers and applications. It exfiltrates this data via Discord webhooks and file uploads. The use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic imports, process termination, and extensive regex for token extraction all suggest malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and this package should be considered dangerous and unsuitable for use.",
