      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup, indicative of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation and stealth tactics justify a malware score of approximately 0.8 and a security risk score of about 0.85. The overall assessment indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity requiring further analysis."
