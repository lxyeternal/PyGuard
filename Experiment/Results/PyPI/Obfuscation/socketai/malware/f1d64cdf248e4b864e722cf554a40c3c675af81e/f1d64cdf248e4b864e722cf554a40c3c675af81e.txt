      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code's suspicious patterns such as eval()/exec() with untrusted data, obfuscation, and hardcoded secrets justify a moderate to high security concern. The most concerning report indicates high malicious activity, warranting a malware score of approximately 0.5, with obfuscation around 0.4 and overall risk around 0.5. Benign reports show minimal or no suspicious activity, with scores near zero. The overall assessment recommends cautious handling of code exhibiting such patterns, with further static and dynamic analysis recommended for confirmation."
