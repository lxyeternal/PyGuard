{
  "purpose": "Custom setuptools setup script that overrides the install command to run an additional module during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the sys.executable to construct a subprocess call; it also imports modules but does not explicitly read user input or external data.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call with sys.executable and module name 'poc_nvk.my_module' is a sink that executes code during installation.",
  "flows": "The install process invokes the custom command, which then calls subprocess with the Python interpreter and a potentially malicious or untrusted module, executing arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated class and method names, which is unusual and may be intended to conceal malicious intent. The subprocess call is made to an external module during setup, which could execute malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that overrides the standard install behavior. During installation, it executes a subprocess calling the Python interpreter with 'poc_nvk.my_module'. The class and method names are obfuscated, raising suspicion. The subprocess invocation could execute malicious code if 'poc_nvk.my_module' contains harmful instructions. The code does not verify or sanitize the module execution, and the obfuscation suggests potential malicious intent to hide its purpose. No other user input or external data sources are involved, but the behavior of executing an arbitrary module during install is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script contains potentially malicious behavior by executing an external module during installation, possibly to run malicious code. The obfuscated class and method names further suggest malicious intent. Caution is advised before using or trusting this package.",
