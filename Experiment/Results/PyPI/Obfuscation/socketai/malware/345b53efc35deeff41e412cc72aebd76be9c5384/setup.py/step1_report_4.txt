  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that customizes the installation process.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, reads 'sys.executable' and 'subprocess' invocation during install.",
  "sinks": "Calls subprocess with potentially untrusted input, executing a module via Python interpreter.",
  "flows": "During installation, subprocess executes '[sys.executable, '-m', 'poc_nvk.my_module']', which could run arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name and method names, no meaningful variable names, no explicit mention of what 'poc_nvk.my_module' does.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, after invoking the parent install method, runs a subprocess executing a module 'poc_nvk.my_module'. The class and method names are intentionally obfuscated, which is suspicious. The subprocess call executes a module via the current Python interpreter, which can be malicious if 'poc_nvk.my_module' contains harmful code. No validation or checks are performed on the module. The setup metadata appears normal but may be masking malicious intent via the post-install execution. The use of dynamic subprocess execution with potentially untrusted modules is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes obfuscated class and method names and executes an external module during installation without validation. This behavior indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent or backdoor functionality, especially considering the obfuscation and execution of external code during setup.",
