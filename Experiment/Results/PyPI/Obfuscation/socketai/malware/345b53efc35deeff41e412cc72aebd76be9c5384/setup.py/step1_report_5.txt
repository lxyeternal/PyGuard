  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to run a specific module after installation",
  "sources": "The 'subprocess.WAMWWlbUKQiofHeJFVZSdbVapCuTvKeY' call with parameters [sys.executable, '-m', 'poc_nvk.my_module']",
  "sinks": "Execution of a subprocess that runs a potentially arbitrary Python module",
  "flows": "Installation process (install) → subprocess call → executes 'poc_nvk.my_module'",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated method name 'WAMWWlbUKQiofHeJFVZSdbVapCuTvKeY', unusual class and method names, the use of a non-standard subprocess function name, and missing import of 'sys' which would cause an error",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom 'install' class that overrides the 'WAMWWlbUKQiofHeJFVZSdbVapCuTvKeY' method, which calls the same method on the superclass and then attempts to execute a subprocess. The subprocess command is intended to run 'poc_nvk.my_module' using the current Python interpreter. However, the function 'subprocess.WAMWWlbUKQiofHeJFVZSdbVapCuTvKeY' is not a standard function and appears obfuscated, suggesting potential malicious intent to hide the real command. Additionally, the 'sys' module is used but never imported, which would cause a runtime error, indicating obfuscation or oversight. The setup script's other elements are standard but serve as a cover for the obfuscated malicious-looking subprocess call.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated function and class names, attempts to run an arbitrary module during installation, and lacks proper imports, indicating malicious intent or sabotage. The primary concern is the execution of an external module ('poc_nvk.my_module') during installation, which could be malicious.",
