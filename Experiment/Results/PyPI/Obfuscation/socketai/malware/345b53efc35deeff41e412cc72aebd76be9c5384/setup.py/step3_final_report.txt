  "purpose": "Detect obfuscation and malicious subprocess execution during package installation, indicating potential backdoor behavior.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call to execute 'poc_nvk.my_module' via sys.executable, within an obfuscated class/method structure.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external module 'poc_nvk.my_module' during setup, which could run arbitrary malicious code.",
  "flows": "Code reads no external input; the flow involves calling an obfuscated subprocess function with sys.executable and module name during install.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, use of 'subprocess.WAMWWlbUKQiofHeJFVZSdbVapCuTvKeY' (non-standard), missing 'import sys', nonsensical variable assignment, and attempt to run external code during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated install class that attempts to execute an external module during setup, a typical malicious backdoor tactic. The subprocess call uses a non-standard function name, indicating obfuscation or malicious intent. The code references 'sys.executable' without importing 'sys', which would cause an error, but this is likely an obfuscation tactic. The obfuscated class and method names further suggest an attempt to hide malicious behavior. The pattern of executing external code during installation is high risk, and obfuscation increases suspicion. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75, obfuscated ~0.85, security risk ~0.8) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent, primarily due to executing an external module during setup within obfuscated code. It should be treated as malicious or backdoored, warranting caution and further investigation.",
