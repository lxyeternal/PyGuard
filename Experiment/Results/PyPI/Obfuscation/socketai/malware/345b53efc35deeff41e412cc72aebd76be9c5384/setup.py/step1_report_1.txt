  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to run a specific module post-installation",
  "sources": "The subprocess call within the custom install class, specifically the WAMWWlbUKQiofHeJFVZSdbVapCuTvKeY method executing a module using sys.executable",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executes a module, which could potentially run arbitrary code or malicious scripts if the module is compromised or malicious",
  "flows": "After the install method is invoked, it triggers a subprocess that executes 'poc_nvk.my_module' with the current Python interpreter",
  "anomalies": [
    "Obfuscated class name 'NyJdzDtFIdKNMLBppzinNDLAWTVaEMcb' and method name 'WAMWWlbUKQiofHeJFVZSdbVapCuTvKeY'",
    "The method calls subprocess.WAMWWlbUKQiofHeJFVZSdbVapCuTvKeY instead of the standard subprocess.call or run, which is unusual and suspicious",
    "The setup argument 'AaavvnruWFBekYYcQaiNiZxzqEbqqlEm' appears to be an obfuscated or nonsensical variable name, assigned a string 'text/markdown' that seems unrelated to standard setup parameters"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools.command.install that overrides the run method (named with obfuscated characters). This method calls the original install method, then executes a subprocess running a module 'poc_nvk.my_module' via the current Python interpreter. The use of obfuscated class and method names suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. The subprocess invocation could execute arbitrary malicious code if the module 'poc_nvk.my_module' is malicious or compromised. The setup configuration appears normal except for the obfuscation and suspicious subprocess call. Overall, the pattern indicates potentially malicious behavior designed to execute code during installation without explicit user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears intentionally obfuscated and performs a subprocess call to execute a specific module during installation. This pattern can be used to run malicious or unwanted code during package installation. The obfuscation and behavior suggest malicious intent, or at least suspicious behavior that warrants further review. The package should be treated with caution until verified.",
