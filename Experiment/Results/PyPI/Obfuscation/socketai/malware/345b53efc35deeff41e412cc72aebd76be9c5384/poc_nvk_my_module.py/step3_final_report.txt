  "purpose": "Collects system hostname, OS name, and IP address, then sends this data via HTTP POST to a specified URL.",

  "sinks": "requests.post() to a hardcoded URL",
  "flows": "System info variables -> JSON payload -> POST request to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; suspicious, generic URL; exception handling references undefined variable 'response'; no user consent or validation",
  "analysis": "The code gathers basic system information and transmits it to an external server, indicating potential reconnaissance or data exfiltration. The URL used is suspicious and generic, often associated with testing or tracking. The obfuscated naming suggests an attempt to conceal intent. The exception handling contains a coding mistake, referencing an undefined variable, which may be accidental or deliberate obfuscation. No malicious payloads like code execution or data theft beyond system info are present. The activity aligns with privacy-invasive scripts or covert monitoring. The malware score is moderate due to exfiltration activity without malicious payloads; the obfuscation score is high due to naming patterns; the security risk is moderate to high because of potential privacy violations and covert data transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs system info collection and exfiltration to a suspicious URL, with obfuscated code and minimal error handling. While it lacks direct malicious payloads, its behavior is privacy-invasive and suspicious, warranting caution. The scores reflect moderate malware potential, high obfuscation, and significant security concern due to covert data transmission.",
