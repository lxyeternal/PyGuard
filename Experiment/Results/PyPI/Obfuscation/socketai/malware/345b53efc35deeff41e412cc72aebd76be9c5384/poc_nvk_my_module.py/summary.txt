  "conclusion": "The script performs system info collection and exfiltration to a suspicious URL, with obfuscated code and minimal error handling. While it lacks direct malicious payloads, its behavior is privacy-invasive and suspicious, warranting caution. The scores reflect moderate malware potential, high obfuscation, and significant security concern due to covert data transmission."
