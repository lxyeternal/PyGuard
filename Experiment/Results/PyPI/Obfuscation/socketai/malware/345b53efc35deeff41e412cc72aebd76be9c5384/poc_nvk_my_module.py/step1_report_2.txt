  "purpose": "Collects and reports the host system information (hostname, OS, IP) to a remote server via HTTP POST request.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname, OS name, and IP address using socket and platform modules.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via requests.post() to a specified URL.",
  "flows": "System information is gathered (source) and then transmitted over the network to the remote server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; hardcoded URL; lack of explicit user consent or documentation; no indication of benign purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that retrieves system hostname, OS name, and IP address. These details are packaged into a JSON object and sent to a hardcoded URL via a POST request. The main execution flow simply calls this function, which sends system information without user knowledge. The obfuscated names suggest an attempt to conceal intent. The URL appears suspicious, and no validation or consent is evident. The code does not perform any malicious system modifications but could be used for tracking or information harvesting without permission.",
  "conclusion": "This code collects system info and transmits it to an external server, potentially for tracking or reconnaissance purposes. Its obfuscated naming and hardcoded URL raise suspicion about its intent. It is not definitively malicious but could be used maliciously depending on context. The overall risk is moderate, mainly due to the lack of transparency and hardcoded endpoint.",
