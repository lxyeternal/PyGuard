  "purpose": "Collects system information (hostname, OS, IP address) and sends it via HTTP POST request to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname (socket.gethostname), OS name (platform.system), IP address (socket.gethostbyname), and the URL string for POST request.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() function where data is sent over the network to the specified URL.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered from sources and sent directly via requests.post() to the hardcoded URL.",
  "anomalies": "The URL used ('https://eobngnpuin253ze.m.pipedream.net/poc') is suspiciously obscure and potentially malicious. The code lacks comments and uses non-descriptive function and variable names, which may indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The data sent includes system info which could be used for fingerprinting or tracking.",
  "analysis": "The script collects basic system details: hostname, OS name, and IP address. It then sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded URL hosted on pipedream.net, a service often used for testing or data collection. The code structure is simple but employs obfuscated function and variable names, which raises suspicion. There is no validation, encryption, or obfuscation of the data, and no explicit user consent or notification. The URL endpoint could be malicious if used without user knowledge, especially since the script appears to gather and exfiltrate system info. The try-except block captures and reports errors during network communication, which is typical but does not mitigate potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect system information and send it to a remote server. The obfuscated naming and obscure URL suggest possible malicious intent or covert data exfiltration. While no direct malicious actions (like executing payloads) are present, the behavior of silently transmitting system details to an external server without user awareness is suspicious and potentially harmful.",
