  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and executes potentially malicious code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports modules ('requests' and 'fernet'), and executes decrypted code via 'exec'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code with 'exec', which can run arbitrary malicious code. Import of modules that can access network ('requests') and perform cryptographic operations ('fernet').",
  "flows": "The decrypted Fernet-encrypted payload is executed via 'exec', potentially running malicious code. Imports of 'requests' and 'Fernet' suggest network communication and cryptographic activities.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload decrypted at runtime and executed via 'exec'. Use of 'exec' with decrypted data is suspicious. The code executes a Fernet decryption key and payload, indicating obfuscation. The encrypted payload appears to be arbitrary data, likely malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package, but within the custom install command, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' (cryptography library). It decrypts a hardcoded Fernet key and an encrypted payload, then executes the payload with 'exec'. This pattern is typical of obfuscated or malicious code that runs arbitrary payloads during installation. The use of encrypted data and 'exec' indicates malicious intent. The package setup appears normal but contains embedded malicious behavior triggered during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, notably decrypting and executing a payload during package installation. The use of encrypted payloads and 'exec' suggests an attempt to hide malicious activities, such as running arbitrary code on target systems. The overall security risk is high.",
