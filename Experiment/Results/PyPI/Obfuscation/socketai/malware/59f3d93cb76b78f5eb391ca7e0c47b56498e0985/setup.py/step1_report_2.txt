{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom install command with potential remote code execution.",
  "sources": "Imports 'os', 'requests', and 'fernet'; reads environment info; decrypts a payload with Fernet.",
  "sinks": "Executes decrypted code via exec() if on Windows, potentially running arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During installation, if OS is Windows, loads requests and Fernet, decrypts data, and executes it via exec(), which is a high-risk flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload and conditional execution based on OS. Use of exec() on decrypted data, which is highly suspicious. Variable names are obfuscated, and the code's purpose is obscured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a package with a custom install class. In the custom class's method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', decrypts a payload with a hardcoded Fernet key, and executes the decrypted code if the OS is Windows. The presence of encrypted data and runtime execution of potentially arbitrary code are classic indicators of malicious intent. The code aims to hide its true purpose via obfuscation and conditional execution, which is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior, notably decrypting and executing code during installation, which could be used for malicious purposes such as remote code execution or backdoors. The use of encrypted payloads and runtime eval strongly suggest malicious intent.",
