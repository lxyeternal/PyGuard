  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high likelihood of malicious activity, decrypting and executing arbitrary code during installation on Windows. The obfuscation, encrypted payload, and runtime execution pattern confirm malicious intent, warranting a malware score of 1, a high obfuscation score, and a maximum security risk score."
