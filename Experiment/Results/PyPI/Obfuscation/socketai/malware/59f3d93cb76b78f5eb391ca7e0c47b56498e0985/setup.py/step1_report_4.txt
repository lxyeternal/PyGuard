{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, including custom installation behavior that executes encrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "The encrypted data within Fernet decrypt call and environment-based conditional code.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec() in the Windows-specific block, potentially running malicious payload.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, decrypts data and executes it, which can run arbitrary code. Other parts handle package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded encrypted payload and runtime decryption followed by exec() only on Windows; absence of validation or restrictions. Encrypted string and decryption indicate obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools components, defines package metadata, and includes a custom install class. The install class has a method that runs only on Windows ('nt'), importing requests and Fernet, decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string, and executes the decrypted content via exec(). This behavior is suspicious because it allows execution of arbitrary code during installation, likely malicious. The presence of encrypted payload and the use of exec() suggest an attempt to obfuscate malicious behavior. The rest of the setup code is typical, but the conditional code block is the main concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious and potentially malicious behavior: decrypting and executing code at install time on Windows systems. This pattern is common in supply chain attacks or malware aiming to run hidden payloads during package installation. Due to the encrypted payload and dynamic execution, this code should be treated as high risk.",
