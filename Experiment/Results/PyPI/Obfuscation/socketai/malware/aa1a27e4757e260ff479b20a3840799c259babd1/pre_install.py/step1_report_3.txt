{
  "purpose": "The function constructs and executes a curl command that sends system information to an external URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via shell commands within the curl command, specifically 'hostname', 'whoami', 'pwd', and 'ls -la'.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executes a shell command that transmits data over the network to an external endpoint (https://eozjyg0uj1pesea.m.pipedream.net).",
  "flows": "System commands generate data (hostname, user, current directory, directory listing) -> data is embedded into a curl POST request -> the request sends data to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of command substitution in HTTP headers, dynamic data collection from the system, and network communication with an external URL suggest suspicious activity. The code appears designed to exfiltrate system information stealthily.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that creates a shell command to perform a POST request. This command collects sensitive system data via command substitution and embeds it in the headers and body of the HTTP request. The command is then executed using subprocess. The obfuscated function name and variable names obscure intent, but the data exfiltration to an external server is suspicious. The code does not perform any malicious actions directly but is designed to silently send system information externally, which is characteristic of data leakage or reconnaissance behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be used for covertly collecting and transmitting system information to an external server, indicative of malicious activity related to data exfiltration. The code's obfuscation and dynamic data collection increase suspicion.",
