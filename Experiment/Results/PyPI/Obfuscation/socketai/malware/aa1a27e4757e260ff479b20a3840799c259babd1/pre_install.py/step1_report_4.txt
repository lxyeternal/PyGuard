{
  "purpose": "The code constructs and executes a curl command that sends system information and directory listing to a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The system commands 'hostname', 'whoami', 'pwd', and 'ls -la' invoked within the curl payload.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executing the constructed curl command sends data to an external URL (https://eozjyg0uj1pesea.m.pipedream.net), which could be used for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system commands (sources) and sent via the curl command to an external server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of command substitution within HTTP headers and the obfuscated variable/function names suggest an attempt to hide intent. The code actively exfiltrates sensitive system info without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function that builds a curl command to POST system details and directory listing to a remote server. The command uses command substitution to embed hostname, username, current directory, and directory contents directly into HTTP headers and POST data. The subprocess call executes this command with shell=True, enabling command execution. The obfuscated names and dynamic command construction indicate malicious intent focused on data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to secretly collect and transmit system information to an external server. It poses a security risk due to unauthorized data exfiltration.",
