{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration that executes an obfuscated external function during installation, potentially indicating malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Import of 'RmJReULVpQThXeFLfVaiDbXDFyjNzPEb' from 'pre_install' and its invocation within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the external, obfuscated function during setup; potential for code execution, data exfiltration, or system modification depending on the function's implementation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code imports and calls the obfuscated function from 'pre_install', which could perform any action on the system or network.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names; execution of an external, opaque function during setup; non-specific download URL; import from a non-standard module.",
  "analysis": "The code employs obfuscation and executes an external function during setup, which are common tactics in malicious packages. The lack of transparency about the function's behavior and the suspicious naming suggest potential malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports range from moderate to high, reflecting suspicion but lacking definitive proof. Given the obfuscation, external invocation, and non-transparent behavior, the overall security risk is elevated. Without further investigation into the 'pre_install' module and the function's actions, the safest stance is to treat this package as potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The package exhibits behaviors consistent with potentially malicious or suspicious activity, primarily due to obfuscation and execution of external code during installation. Further analysis of the 'pre_install' module and the specific function is necessary before trusting or deploying this package.",
