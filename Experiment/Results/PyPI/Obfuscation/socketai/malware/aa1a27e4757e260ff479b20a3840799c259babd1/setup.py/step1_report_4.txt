{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, including custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and a custom module 'pre_install'. The 'setup()' function with package metadata and custom command class.",
  "sinks": "The custom class 'iVTdjprjtwnsmwLWzrxATilcCkKHtdXJ()' calls 'RmJReULVpQThXeFLfVaiDbXDFyjNzPEb()', which is imported but not shown in this snippet.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'install' command executes 'RmJReULVpQThXeFLfVaiDbXDFyjNzPEb()' from 'pre_install', then proceeds with normal installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and function names, which could indicate intent to hide behavior. The imported 'RmJReULVpQThXeFLfVaiDbXDFyjNzPEb' is potentially suspicious given its opaque naming.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setup procedures with obfuscated class and function names. The custom install class runs a function from 'pre_install' during installation, which could perform arbitrary actions. The function name and class name are intentionally obscure, raising suspicion. The code itself does not contain visible malicious code like network connections, data theft, or system manipulation, but the obfuscation and import of an unknown function from 'pre_install' pose a security concern. Without the implementation of 'RmJReULVpQThXeFLfVaiDbXDFyjNzPEb', the true intent cannot be fully determined. The setup URL points to a non-meaningful address, further raising questions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package setup with obfuscated elements that could hide malicious behavior. The invocation of an unknown function during install warrants caution, as it could perform malicious actions. Overall, the risk level is moderate, mainly due to obfuscation and unknown external function execution.",
