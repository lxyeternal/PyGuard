  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function within a larger Python project, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, configuration files, or user inputs (not explicitly shown in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands (not explicitly shown in the snippet).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or user inputs through processing functions to sinks such as network or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are evident. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious imports detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard library usage. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure suggests typical utility functions without any hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious anomalies or malware indicators.",
