{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but no explicit purpose is clearly stated within the code snippet provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from variables, function parameters, and possibly from environment variables or external sources if present in the full code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or use of eval/exec statements, which could lead to code injection or data exfiltration if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables, external data) to sinks (network, files, eval/exec), potentially via intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The code structure appears standard without unusual language features. However, without seeing the full code, some dynamic execution or hidden behavior cannot be completely ruled out.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet provided is minimal and does not contain explicit security risks or malicious patterns. It does not include suspicious imports, network activity, or eval/exec calls. The absence of visible malicious behavior suggests a low likelihood of embedded malware. The code's intent is unclear but appears benign based on the visible content. Given the limited scope, there's low confidence in identifying hidden malicious activity without additional context.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and safe, but a complete review would require full context to rule out hidden or dynamic behaviors.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
