  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Code input, data handling functions, environment variables, network connections, dynamic features, and any external module usage.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, or dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input functions or environment reads leading to sinks like network calls, file writes, or eval/exec statements.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual variable naming.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently describe benign, straightforward code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. Malware scores are uniformly 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity. Obfuscation scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation detected. Security risk scores range from 0.1 to 0.3, reflecting minimal concern given the benign descriptions. The confidence levels are high, and the reasoning in each report is sound. Minor dynamic features or limited context do not elevate the risk significantly. Overall, the code appears safe, with negligible security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided analyses, the code is highly likely benign, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and the assessments are consistent and reasonable.",
