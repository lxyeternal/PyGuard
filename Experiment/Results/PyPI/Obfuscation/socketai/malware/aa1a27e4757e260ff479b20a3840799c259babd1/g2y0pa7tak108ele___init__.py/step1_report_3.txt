{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing and possibly network communication, but its exact purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from environment variables, function arguments, or external files read within the code.",
  "sinks": "Data could be sent over network sockets, written to files, or used in system commands, potentially exposing data leaks or executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (environment variables, inputs) flows into processing functions, then potentially to network or file output points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or malicious backdoors are detected. However, use of dynamic code execution or obscure variable names warrants caution; further inspection is needed.",
  "analysis": "The code involves data handling routines with some dynamic features, such as string manipulation or conditional logic, but lacks clear evidence of malicious intent. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are explicitly identified. The code does not appear obfuscated; it uses standard Python constructs. No unusual API calls or external connections are observed. Without runtime context or additional code, suspicion level remains low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on static analysis, the code does not exhibit obvious malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard data processing script with no signs of malware. However, incomplete visibility into external interactions prevents a definitive conclusion.",
