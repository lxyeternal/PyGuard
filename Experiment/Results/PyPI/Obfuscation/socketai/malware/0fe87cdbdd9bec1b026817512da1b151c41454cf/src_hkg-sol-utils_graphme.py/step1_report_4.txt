  "flows": "No data flows are present; no input or output operations are performed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal and does not perform any operations. The import of 'os' alone is common and not suspicious. There are no hidden or unusual elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for the 'os' module with no additional logic. Without further context or operations, it does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. Importing 'os' is standard for scripts that perform system operations but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal code snippet that does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports the 'os' module without executing any potentially harmful actions.",
