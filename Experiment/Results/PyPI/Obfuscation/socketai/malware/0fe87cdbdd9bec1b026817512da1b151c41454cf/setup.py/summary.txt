  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk malicious indicators, including covert DNS communication and obfuscated package management. The scores of malware 0.75, obfuscation 0.6, and security risk 0.8 are justified given the evidence. It should be flagged for further investigation and not trusted in production environments."
