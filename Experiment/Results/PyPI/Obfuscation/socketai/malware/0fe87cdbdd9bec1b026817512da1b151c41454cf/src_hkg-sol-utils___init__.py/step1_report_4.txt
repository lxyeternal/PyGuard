  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for performing a specific task, possibly involving data processing or system interaction, but the exact purpose is unclear due to lack of context and obfuscated segments.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from standard input, environment variables, and possibly from imported modules or external files.",
  "sinks": "Data could potentially be sent over network connections, written to files, or displayed, but no explicit sinks are clearly evident without further context.",
  "flows": "Input data from sources could flow into functions or modules that perform processing or communication; however, the specific source-to-sink paths are obscured or not explicitly detailed in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No overt hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are detected. There are some unconventional language features or dynamic code execution patterns, but these are not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code includes standard import statements and function definitions. No suspicious network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. Usage of dynamic features such as eval() or exec() is absent or not clearly malicious. The structure and formatting do not suggest obfuscation or malware. Without additional context or external data, no malicious intent or security risks are identifiable.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the given code, there are no clear indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign, with no signs of malware or supply chain attacks. However, the lack of context limits certainty.",
