  "purpose": "This code appears to be a Python module intended for data processing or utility functions, but without explicit comments or documentation, its exact purpose is ambiguous.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules, but no explicit source code shows input handling.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data outputs like print statements, file writes, network requests, or system calls, but no direct sinks are evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are observable in the provided code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are present. The code uses standard Python features and libraries without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, lacking any complex or suspicious constructs. No evidence of data leaks, malicious backdoors, or malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration or system damage is observed. It appears to be a benign utility or processing module, but the absence of comments makes full intent unclear. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code seems benign, though its purpose cannot be definitively ascertained due to lack of context.",
