  "conclusion": "The dependency shows some potential for misuse due to dynamic execution and network activity but lacks concrete malicious payloads. The scoring aligns with the observed behaviors, indicating low to moderate concern. No immediate action is necessary, but further static and dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious segments, especially in reports highlighting obfuscation and network interactions."
