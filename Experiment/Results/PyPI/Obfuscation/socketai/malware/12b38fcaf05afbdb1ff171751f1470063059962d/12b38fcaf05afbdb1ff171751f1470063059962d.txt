      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high suspicion of malicious or covert surveillance activity, primarily due to obfuscation, network requests during setup, and data encoding patterns. It warrants thorough static and dynamic analysis before deployment, and should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious."

      "conclusion": "The script is mainly for reconnaissance and information gathering, with obfuscation techniques that could be exploited maliciously. No explicit malicious payloads are present, but its behavior and obfuscation increase suspicion. It should be treated as potentially malicious, with a moderate security concern."
