  "sinks": "os.system() executing the decoded command",
  "flows": "Decode the base64 string -> execute the resulting command via os.system()",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding followed by execution with os.system() suggests obfuscation and potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code stores a base64-encoded string that, when decoded, forms a command. It then executes this command using os.system(). This pattern is commonly used to obfuscate malicious commands or scripts. The encoded string appears to be a URL or command string which, when decoded, may perform network communication or other actions. The code's structure indicates an attempt to hide the actual command, which raises suspicion of malicious intent. There are no other sources or sinks; the primary concern is the decode-and-execute pattern that can be exploited for malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely malicious due to its obfuscation and execution of a decoded string, which could be a malicious command or URL. This pattern is typical of malicious scripts attempting to hide their true intent.",
