  "purpose": "Execute a base64-decoded command that appears to invoke a URL or script.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string assigned to 'PhmnNUzwhvNOGfzJRvpiomxuXZtkYULd'.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing the decoded command, potentially running arbitrary code or scripts.",
  "flows": "base64.b64decode -> os.system",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obscure command content, which is suspicious; the command seems to be a cURL command with a URL, possibly to fetch or interact with external resources.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a string that appears to be a base64-encoded command. Decoding reveals a cURL command to an external URL (https://pypi.org) and includes parameters that resemble a curl command with headers or flags. The script then executes this decoded string directly via os.system, which could run arbitrary commands or scripts fetched from the internet. The obfuscation via base64 and execution of decoded commands indicates malicious intent, such as retrieving malicious payloads or exfiltrating data. This pattern is common in malware that aims to conceal its true purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious and likely malicious, as it decodes and executes an external command, potentially running harmful code or communicating with a malicious server. The use of obfuscation techniques and execution of external resources pose security risks.",
