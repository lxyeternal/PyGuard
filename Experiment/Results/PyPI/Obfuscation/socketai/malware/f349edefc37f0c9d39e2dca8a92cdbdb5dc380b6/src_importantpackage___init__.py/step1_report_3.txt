{
  "purpose": "Execute a base64-decoded command line instruction, likely for remote access or configuration.",
  "sources": "The variable 'PhmnNUzwhvNOGfzJRvpiomxuXZtkYULd' containing the base64-encoded string.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executing the decoded string as a shell command.",
  "flows": "Base64 string is decoded, then passed directly to os.system(), executing the resulting command.",
  "anomalies": "The code encodes a command in base64, which is often used to obfuscate malicious commands. The decoded command appears to be a cURL request to a suspicious URL that could be used to download or execute remote content.",
  "analysis": "The script stores a base64-encoded string that, when decoded, forms a shell command. The command is a cURL invocation to 'https://pypi.org' with additional options, possibly intended to download or interact with remote resources. Executing this command via os.system() can lead to remote code execution if the decoded command is malicious or manipulates the system. The obfuscation suggests an intent to hide the actual behavior. This pattern is consistent with attempts to perform remote access or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a base64-decoded command that likely contacts an external URL. Its obfuscation and remote interaction are suspicious and could be malicious, possibly used for unauthorized remote access or command and control. It warrants further investigation and should be considered potentially malicious.",
