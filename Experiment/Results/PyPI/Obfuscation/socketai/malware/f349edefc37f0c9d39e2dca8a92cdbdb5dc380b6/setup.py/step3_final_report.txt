  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, reading a README file and configuring package metadata with dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description; static metadata in setup() call; the anomalous dictionary key 'jZExGbHMvqhuuISbzROzbOywFYEagKQA' as a parameter in setup()",
  "sinks": "The setup() function does not process untrusted data; no network or file output; the anomalous key is passed as a parameter but not used for execution",
  "flows": "Reading README.md (source) → passing static data and anomalous key to setup() (sink); no dynamic or untrusted data flow",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a non-standard, nonsensical dictionary key 'jZExGbHMvqhuuISbzROzbOywFYEagKQA' in setup() parameters; no explanation for its purpose",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with static metadata. The only anomaly is the unusual key, which does not affect execution but suggests possible obfuscation or typo. No malicious code, dynamic execution, or network activity is present. The key's randomness raises suspicion but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score remains 0, obfuscation score is moderate (~0.3), and security risk is low (~0.2), reflecting the anomaly but no active threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with an anomalous but non-malicious key. No malware detected. The scores are appropriate, but the key warrants further review to confirm intent. Overall, the package appears safe based on this code snippet.",
