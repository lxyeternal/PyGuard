  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package distribution, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, defining package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected that could lead to security issues or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads from README.md as a source for long_description, then uses setuptools.setup to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual field 'jZExGbHMvqhuuISbzROzbOywFYEagKQA' which appears to be an invalid or obfuscated key; no clear purpose or standard usage. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures, reading a Markdown file for the description, specifying dependencies, and configuring package metadata. The unusual key 'jZExGbHMvqhuuISbzROzbOywFYEagKQA' does not conform to typical setup.py fields and may be an obfuscated or unintended entry, potentially signaling an anomaly. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. No dangerous code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with one anomalous, potentially malformed or obfuscated field. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from the provided code.",
