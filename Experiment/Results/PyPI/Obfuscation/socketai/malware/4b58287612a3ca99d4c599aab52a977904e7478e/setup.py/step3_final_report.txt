{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, defining dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports modules and assigns a variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no malicious data flow exists.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only executes package setup functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an unused, obfuscated-looking variable 'SAOtUXZAijdvsgVGvIZhyTtuEeILvIUk' assigned to '1.0.0' but not used elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup with no active malicious behavior. The variable name appears obfuscated but is unused, indicating possible obfuscation or placeholder. Dependencies are common packages. No network activity, data leaks, or code execution beyond package configuration are present. The obfuscated variable does not impact functionality and is not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.2-0.3, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the minimal anomaly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with only a superficial obfuscation artifact that does not pose security risks. The low malware and risk scores are justified and should remain unchanged.",
