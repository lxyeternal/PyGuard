{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with specific dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded version string, package name, and dependencies in the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network communication, file access, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "The data flows from hardcoded strings (package name, version, dependencies) into the setup process, with no further data handling or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'SAOtUXZAijdvsgVGvIZhyTtuEeILvIUk' used for version, which appears obfuscated or intentionally obscure; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools, with dependencies on 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. The variable name for version is unusual but does not affect functionality. No code executes any network requests, data collection, or malicious behavior. There is no code logic beyond the setup call.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable name for version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent.",
