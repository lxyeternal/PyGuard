{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be executing dynamically decoded and deobfuscated Python code, likely intended to perform some hidden or malicious operations.",
  "sources": "The primary source of data is a base64-encoded string decoded within the code, which then gets decoded into ASCII and executed via exec(). Additionally, there is a large hardcoded mapping dictionary used for character substitution in decoding.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decoded string, which may include malicious payloads, backdoors, or unauthorized actions. The code also involves multiple layers of decoding, potentially obfuscating malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "The base64-decoded data is transformed through character substitution using the mapping dictionary, then concatenated into a string which is executed via exec(). This source-to-sink flow enables arbitrary code execution from obfuscated data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation via multiple layers of decoding and character substitution, use of eval/exec to run dynamically generated code, extensive hardcoded mappings, and the complex encoding/decoding process all suggest attempts to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script first decodes a long base64-encoded string, then applies a character substitution based on a large hardcoded dictionary to reconstruct executable Python code. The resulting code is then executed with exec(). This pattern is characteristic of obfuscated malicious scripts aiming to hide their true behavior. The decoding process involves multiple layers of character transformations, making static analysis challenging. The code’s purpose is likely to run malicious commands, backdoors, or payloads without detection. The heavy obfuscation and dynamic code execution are typical of malicious payloads attempting to evade detection mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits strong signs of obfuscation designed to conceal malicious activity. It dynamically reconstructs and executes code from an encoded and mapped string, which could contain harmful operations such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or backdoors. The use of eval/exec and complex transformations suggests intentional concealment of malicious intent. Overall, this package should be considered highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
