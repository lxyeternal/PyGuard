{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package and potentially execute a hidden PowerShell command for an unspecified purpose.",
  "sources": "Reading the file system (os.path.exists), reading environment variables, and executing a subprocess with a PowerShell command encoded in Base64.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executes an external command, which can run arbitrary PowerShell code, potentially malicious.",
  "flows": "Code checks for existence of 'tahg' directory, then executes encoded PowerShell command via subprocess if not present.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded in Base64, which is often used to obfuscate malicious scripts. The code suppresses exceptions silently, hiding failures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports distutils for package setup, then attempts to run a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command if 'tahg' directory does not exist. The encoded command, when decoded, likely performs actions over the network or other malicious operations. The try-except blocks suppress errors, hiding potential malicious activity. The package setup information appears standard but is wrapped around suspicious code execution. The code's obfuscation via encoding and silent failure handling increases suspicion. Overall, the code seems designed to execute hidden, potentially malicious PowerShell commands during package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It aims to run hidden commands without raising alerts. The package may perform malicious actions during installation or import, representing a security risk.",
