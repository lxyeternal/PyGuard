      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscated, silent execution of a PowerShell command during package setup. The pattern aligns with malware tactics, warranting a high malware score and security risk rating. The behavior should be flagged for further analysis, including decoding the PowerShell command to determine its exact payload."
