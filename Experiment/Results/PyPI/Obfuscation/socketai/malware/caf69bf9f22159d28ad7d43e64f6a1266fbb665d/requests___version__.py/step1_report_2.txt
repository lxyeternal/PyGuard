  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided, but it appears to be related to a Python package potentially intended for general use.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and potentially from external modules or functions (if any). Specific data sources are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network operations, or data output functions (not detailed here), which are typical points where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "The flow involves data originating from environment variables or inputs, passing through processing functions, and potentially reaching sinks such as network or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are visible. The code structure appears standard, with no obfuscated language features or unnecessary dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal and does not include any suspicious patterns such as code injection, data leakage, or insecure handling of data. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently malicious. The lack of detailed logic limits a comprehensive analysis, but no anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no signs of malware or dangerous security flaws.",
