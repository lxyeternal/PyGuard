  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, environment variables, network interactions, external modules, input/output points, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network calls, file system modifications, environment variable access, data leaks, dynamic eval/exec, suspicious API usage.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data to sinks like network transmission or file writes, if any suspicious patterns exist.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, unusual code structures, obfuscation patterns, dynamic code execution, unexplained network activity, suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code, with descriptions supporting benign assessments. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the lack of malicious indicators. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited or absent code snippets. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified across reports. The cautious approach with low risk scores aligns with the evidence, and the assessments are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and appropriate, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk scores reflect the limited potential for harm based on current information. No adjustments are necessary; the dependency appears safe.",
