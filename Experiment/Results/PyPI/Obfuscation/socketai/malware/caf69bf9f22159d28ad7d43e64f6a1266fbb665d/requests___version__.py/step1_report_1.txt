  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that imports standard libraries and performs a basic operation, but there is no clear purpose or functionality specified.",
  "sources": "Reading input from environment variables, user input, or external files is not evident; no obvious sources of untrusted data identified.",
  "sinks": "No evidence of data being sent over the network, written to files, or executed in a way that could be malicious; no suspicious sink points detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow detected; the code executes basic operations without untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs observed. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script is minimal and straightforward, importing common libraries and performing simple operations without any external input, network activity, or system modification. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The lack of external dependencies or data flow reduces the likelihood of hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is benign and appears safe for use.",
