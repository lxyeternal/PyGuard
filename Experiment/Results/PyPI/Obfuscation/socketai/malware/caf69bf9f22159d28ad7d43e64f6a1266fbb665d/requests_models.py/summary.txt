  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated HTTP client library that performs standard request and response operations. While the obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no direct indication of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. The malware score is set to 0.2 to reflect the obfuscation concern but not malicious intent. The obfuscation score remains high at 0.8, and the overall security risk is moderate at 0.3, primarily due to the difficulty in analysis caused by heavy obfuscation."
