  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but appears to be benign in its current form. No evidence of malicious activity or sabotage is present. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion but does not imply malicious intent. The security risk remains low, though further review is advisable if integrated into larger systems."
