  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines custom exception classes and imports exceptions.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated class and variable names; static string attributes; no data processing or external communication.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected; static code with obfuscation possibly for concealment.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.7, Risk 0.2 — reasonable given the obfuscation but no active threats.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining custom exception classes and constants.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated naming; static attributes; no external interactions.\n- **Assessment:** Likely obfuscated placeholder code; no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.8, Risk 0 — consistent with the static, obfuscated nature.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines exception classes with obfuscated attributes.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated class and attribute names; static strings; inheritance from exception types.\n- **Assessment:** No active malicious behavior; obfuscation may be concealment.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.9, Risk 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines exception classes and constants.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated naming; static string attributes; no data flow or external actions.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; possibly part of a larger obfuscated codebase.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.7, Risk 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar class definitions with obfuscation.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated class and variable names; static attributes; no operational logic.\n- **Assessment:** No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.8, Risk 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe code that primarily consists of class definitions with obfuscated names and static string attributes.\n- **Behavior:** No data flow, no external communication, no processing of untrusted input, and no system modifications.\n- **Obfuscation:** The obfuscated class and variable names, along with static string attributes, suggest attempts to hide purpose or serve as placeholders.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None detected; the code does not perform any network, file, or system operations.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0**, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** is justified at around **0.7–0.9**, reflecting the obfuscated naming and static attributes.\n- The **security risk score** should stay low (~0.1–0.2), as no active threats are present.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.8** (consistent with obfuscated naming and static data)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (low, given the lack of active malicious activity)\n\nThis code appears to be obfuscated, possibly to conceal its purpose, but in its current form, it does not pose a security threat. Further context or operational code would be necessary to reassess for hidden malicious intent.",
