  "purpose": "The script appears to perform system and network operations, including potentially downloading and executing files, and attempting to elevate privileges or modify system files.",
  "sources": "Reading from the file '__version__.py', 'README.md', and network requests to specific IP addresses for downloading files.",
  "sinks": "Executing shell commands ('cmd /c'), writing files ('local_copy.txt', 'local_b.txt'), moving and deleting files, and making network requests to specific IPs.",
  "flows": "Data from '__version__.py' is read, network responses are saved to files, and then these files are executed or moved via shell commands. Network data is fetched from hardcoded IP addresses and saved locally, then used in subsequent shell commands.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads files from specific IP addresses and executes them via shell commands, which is suspicious. It attempts privilege escalation by using 'net session' and checks for 'Access is denied'. Additionally, it installs 'requests' if not available. The use of obfuscated variable names and the hardcoded IPs for network activity are unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing modules and performing a Python version check. It defines a custom test command class that uses pytest with CPU core count. Then, it reads version info from a specific file and the README content. The setup() function configures the package with dependencies, metadata, and other options. The most suspicious part is the Windows-specific block: it executes shell commands to get the temp directory, attempts to install 'requests' if missing, then downloads files from specific IP addresses, writes them locally, and executes them via shell commands. It also checks for administrator privileges using 'net session' and conditionally downloads and runs additional files. The use of hardcoded IP addresses, remote downloads, and executing downloaded files indicate malicious behavior. The code seems designed to install or run remote payloads covertly, potentially for malicious purposes. There is no legitimate reason for downloading and executing files from external IPs within a package setup script. This strongly suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote files, potentially establishing a backdoor or payload. It also attempts privilege escalation and checks for administrative rights. The obfuscated variable names and network activity from fixed IPs are suspicious. Overall, this code is highly malicious and should be considered unsafe for use.",
