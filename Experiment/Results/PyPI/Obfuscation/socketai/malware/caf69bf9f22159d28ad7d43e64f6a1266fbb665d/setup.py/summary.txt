  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including remote payload download and execution, privilege checks, and obfuscation. It aligns with typical malware or backdoor activity embedded within a package setup script. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified. It should be flagged as unsafe and removed from distribution channels."
