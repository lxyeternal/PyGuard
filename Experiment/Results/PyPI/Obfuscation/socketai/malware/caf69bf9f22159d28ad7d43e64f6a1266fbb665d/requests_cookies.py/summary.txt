  "conclusion": "The code functions as a compatibility layer for cookie management, with significant obfuscation that warrants caution. No direct malicious activity is evident from the provided snippets or descriptions. The low malware scores are appropriate, but the high obfuscation suggests further review is advisable. Overall, the code appears benign but suspicious due to obfuscation, and it should be audited in the context of the entire codebase before deployment."
