      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including remote payload download and execution, privilege checks, and obfuscation. It aligns with typical malware or backdoor activity embedded within a package setup script. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified. It should be flagged as unsafe and removed from distribution channels."

The high obfuscation score warrants caution, but overall, the security risk remains low. Further investigation is recommended if executable code or malicious payloads are discovered elsewhere in the repository."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated HTTP client library that performs standard request and response operations. While the obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no direct indication of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. The malware score is set to 0.2 to reflect the obfuscation concern but not malicious intent. The obfuscation score remains high at 0.8, and the overall security risk is moderate at 0.3, primarily due to the difficulty in analysis caused by heavy obfuscation."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a compatibility layer for cookie management, with significant obfuscation that warrants caution. No direct malicious activity is evident from the provided snippets or descriptions. The low malware scores are appropriate, but the high obfuscation suggests further review is advisable. Overall, the code appears benign but suspicious due to obfuscation, and it should be audited in the context of the entire codebase before deployment."
