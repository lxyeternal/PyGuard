  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a placeholder or an empty script with no functional implementation.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are read or utilized in this code.",
  "sinks": "No outputs, data transmission, or system modifications are present, thus no sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths since the code does nothing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no operations, variables, or logic; it is effectively empty. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is empty or a placeholder with no executable statements, inputs, or outputs. There are no suspicious patterns, no external calls, or potentially malicious activities. Given its simplicity, it does not pose security risks. Without further code content, it’s not possible to identify any malicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and non-functional. It does not include any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is negligible.",
