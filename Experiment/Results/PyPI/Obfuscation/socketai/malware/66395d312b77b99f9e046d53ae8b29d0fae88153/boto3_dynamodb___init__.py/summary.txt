  "security_risk": 0.55,
  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code with obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns (notably in report 5) suggests moderate malicious potential, justifying higher malware and security risk scores. Benign scripts are correctly scored low. Overall, the scores align with the observed behaviors, with slight room for adjustment in the suspicious code to reflect increased concern."
