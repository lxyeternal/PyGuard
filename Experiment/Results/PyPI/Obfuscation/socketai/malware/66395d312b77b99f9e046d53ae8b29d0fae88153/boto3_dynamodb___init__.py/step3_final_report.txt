  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, external data sources, dynamic execution points (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variable access, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (parameters/env) to dynamic execution or data sinks like network/file systems.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec, encoded data handling, hardcoded URLs or credentials, unusual import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution techniques, which are common in malicious scripts. No explicit malicious payloads are observed, but the suspicious patterns and obfuscation increase the likelihood of malicious intent. Static analysis indicates potential for data exfiltration or code injection, especially if combined with external data sources. Benign scripts lack obfuscation and dynamic features. The overall suspicion level is higher in code with obfuscation and eval/exec usage, warranting cautious scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code with obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns (notably in report 5) suggests moderate malicious potential, justifying higher malware and security risk scores. Benign scripts are correctly scored low. Overall, the scores align with the observed behaviors, with slight room for adjustment in the suspicious code to reflect increased concern.",
