  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that prints a greeting message.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources such as user input, environment variables, or network data are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or sensitive data handling occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present; the code simply executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. It is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a basic print operation with a static string. No external data is read, and no untrusted inputs or outputs are present. The simplicity reduces the likelihood of malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or sensitive operations are observed. The code structure is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward script with no suspicious behavior.",
