  "purpose": "Compatibility handling, filesystem operations, and deprecation warnings related to AWS SDK and Python versions.",
  "sources": "System info checks, import statements, filesystem functions (os.remove, os.rename), warnings filters.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem modifications, warnings issued, import of external libraries.",
  "flows": "System info influences conditional imports and function definitions; warnings are triggered based on version checks; filesystem functions execute based on platform.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, deprecated import from 'botocore.vendored', no hardcoded credentials or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code manages environment compatibility, suppresses specific warnings, and issues deprecation notices. Obfuscated identifiers suggest an attempt to conceal code structure but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The deprecated import is a known AWS SDK issue, not an attack vector. Overall, the code is benign, serving compatibility and notification purposes, with obfuscation likely for concealment rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily handling environment compatibility and user notifications. No evidence of malicious activity or security risks. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The overall security risk is low, and malware score remains at 0.",
