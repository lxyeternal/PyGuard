{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up environment-specific file operations, handle compatibility between Python 2 and 3, and issue a deprecation warning related to Python version support for Boto3.",
  "sources": "Code reads system information (sys.version_info, sys.platform), environment variables, and files during os.remove and os.rename operations.",
  "sinks": "The warnings module outputs a warning message; os.remove and os.rename modify the filesystem; imports indicate potential external library interactions.",
  "flows": "System info (sources) influences conditional logic for imports and function definitions; filesystem operations (sinks) are triggered based on platform; warning messages (sinks) are issued based on version info.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, but no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected. Import of 'botocore.vendored.six' and 'boto3.exceptions' is typical for AWS SDK usage; no malicious behavior apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages compatibility and deprecation warnings, with platform-specific file renaming functions. It suppresses specific warnings related to Python support deprecation for Boto3. No indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. Variable naming is obfuscated but appears to serve typical compatibility and notification functions. No network activity or data exfiltration is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing on environment compatibility, filesystem handling, and issuing deprecation warnings. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
