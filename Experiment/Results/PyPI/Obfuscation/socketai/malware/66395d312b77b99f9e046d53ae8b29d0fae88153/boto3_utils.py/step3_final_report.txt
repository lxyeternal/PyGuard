  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for dynamic module import, class extension, and service context management, facilitating flexible runtime behavior.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import via __import__, class attribute injection, and function parameters used for module and attribute names.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import and attribute setting based on input parameters, which could lead to code execution or manipulation if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (full_name, attribute name, attribute value) flow into dynamic import and attribute injection functions, potentially enabling malicious code execution if inputs are malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of undefined variable 'module' in import_module call suggests bug or obfuscation; variable names are non-descriptive, indicating obfuscation; no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs dynamic import and attribute injection, which are inherently risky if inputs are untrusted. The presence of an undefined variable 'module' indicates a bug or obfuscation, increasing suspicion. No explicit malicious payloads or backdoors are present, but the techniques used could be exploited for malicious purposes if misused. The obfuscated variable names and dynamic behavior justify moderate scores for obfuscation and risk. Malware is unlikely given the absence of payloads, but the potential for misuse warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not inherently malicious but employs dynamic and obfuscated techniques that could be exploited if inputs are untrusted. Proper validation and input sanitization are recommended to mitigate potential security risks.",
