{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes and error handling related to AWS SDK (botocore) exceptions, primarily for resource and API version validation, as well as some generic condition handling and warnings.",
  "sources": "Imports botocore.exceptions; the code reads input from constructor parameters and string formatting; no external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Uses exception constructors and string formatting to generate error messages; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or code execution detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into exception message strings, which are then used to instantiate exceptions; no untrusted data flows into dangerous functions or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Code employs obfuscated class names and variable names, which is unusual but not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The class structure and exception handling are typical for error management.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly for defining custom exception classes with specific messages, extending standard exceptions, and includes some warning classes. The use of string interpolation and class inheritance appears standard for error handling in a library. No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or suspicious behavior are detected. The obfuscated naming could be an attempt to disguise intent but could also be a coding style or code generation artifact. Overall, there are no signs of malicious code or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of custom exception and warning class definitions related to AWS SDK error handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious activity.",
