  "conclusion": "While no direct malicious payloads are evident, the heavy obfuscation, dynamic resource registration, and internal SDK modifications pose a moderate to high security risk. The code could be exploited to introduce backdoors, manipulate AWS resources covertly, or exfiltrate data if malicious inputs are provided. Therefore, it warrants cautious review and further dynamic analysis before deployment, especially in supply chain contexts."
