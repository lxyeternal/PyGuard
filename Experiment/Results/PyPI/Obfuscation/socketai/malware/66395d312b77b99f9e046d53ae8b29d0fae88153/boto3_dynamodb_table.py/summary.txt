  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate batch request handler with heavy obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or backdoors. While obfuscation warrants caution, the current analysis indicates a benign utility. The malware score remains at 0, with a high obfuscation score (0.8) and a moderate security risk (0.3). Overall, the code appears safe but should be reviewed in context, especially regarding logging and obfuscation practices."
