  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with suspicious import statements and inert logging, indicating potential concealment of malicious intent. While no explicit malicious activity is evident, the obfuscation and dynamic session creation pose risks if integrated into a larger malicious context. The scores reflect low malware likelihood (0.2), high obfuscation (0.8), and moderate security risk (0.4). Further review of the entire package and environment is recommended to confirm safety."
