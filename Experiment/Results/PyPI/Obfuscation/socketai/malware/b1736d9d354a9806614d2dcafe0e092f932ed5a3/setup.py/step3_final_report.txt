  "purpose": "Detects potentially malicious behavior involving obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess call executing encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the subprocess running the encoded PowerShell command; silent error handling conceals failures.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check -> Conditional branch -> Subprocess executes encoded command with hidden window.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command; silent exception handling; execution during setup; conditional logic based on directory existence.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory; if absent, it runs a subprocess executing a base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window flags, aiming to conceal activity. The command is obfuscated, indicating malicious intent or sabotage. Broad try-except blocks suppress errors, potentially hiding malicious payloads. The pattern—obfuscated, hidden execution during setup—is characteristic of supply chain attacks or malware. Scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.8, obfuscated ~0.9, security risk ~0.85) are justified given the suspicious pattern. The behavior warrants caution, and decoding the payload is recommended for definitive assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup. The pattern aligns with common tactics in malicious supply chain components. Scores across reports are consistent and justified; the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further payload analysis confirms benign intent.",
