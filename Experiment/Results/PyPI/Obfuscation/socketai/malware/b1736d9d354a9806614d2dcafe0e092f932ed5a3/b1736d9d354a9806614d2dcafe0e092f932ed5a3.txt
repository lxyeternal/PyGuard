      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup. The pattern aligns with common tactics in malicious supply chain components. Scores across reports are consistent and justified; the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further payload analysis confirms benign intent."
