      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent but slightly reduces readability. The scores assigned are appropriate, with malware score at 0, obfuscation around 0.7, and low security risk (~0.15)."

      "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, functioning as a backdoor or remote payload downloader. Its obfuscation, remote code fetching, and execution patterns pose significant security risks. The high malware (0.9), obfuscation (0.8), and risk (0.9) scores are justified based on these behaviors."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.7,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and ambiguous usage of 'delete', raising suspicion but lacking concrete evidence of malicious activity. The scores should reflect low to moderate malware suspicion, with high obfuscation scores justified. Further analysis of the 'frequest' module and runtime behavior is necessary to confirm malicious intent."
