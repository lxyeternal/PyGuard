  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent but slightly reduces readability. The scores assigned are appropriate, with malware score at 0, obfuscation around 0.7, and low security risk (~0.15)."
