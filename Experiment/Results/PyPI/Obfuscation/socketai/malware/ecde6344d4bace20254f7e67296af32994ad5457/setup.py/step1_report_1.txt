{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 't75x685m8klfm0f0', primarily configuring package metadata and dependencies for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads package requirements; reads metadata variables; does not take external input during execution.",
  "sinks": "Uses the setup() function to process metadata; no untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to data leaks or code execution during runtime.",
  "flows": "Metadata and dependency data flow from static variables and external files into the setup() function; no dynamic or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., oFkacROHeyDCvtOHnNKQOCabQfOAqMTD, lnVFdpdcPmHkdiKmYBrRReLVqGSVBqbV, FGXGuMmHEbbzKtMGvhFLJOYegIGMIqBE, ZHkbmLxQZkFqFFBqOTSwvDydpHLRqjSj, aNkhmuupMNJMaKUIoaRvBMdQsVFDwqfV); use of base64-like strings and unusual variable naming; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and codecs, reads a README file for description, sets project metadata, and specifies dependencies. All variable names appear intentionally obscured, but they are only used to store static strings and data. The setup() call is straightforward, with no dynamic execution or untrusted data. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to hide intent, but their usage is limited to static data assignment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names, likely for code concealment, but it does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware are evident from this code.",
