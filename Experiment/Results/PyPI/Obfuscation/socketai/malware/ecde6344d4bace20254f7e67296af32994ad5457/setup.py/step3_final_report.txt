  "purpose": "Standard Python setup.py script for packaging a project, defining metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file, static metadata variables, dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no code execution, no network activity.",
  "flows": "Static data flows into setup() parameters; no dynamic or untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, superficial obfuscation without malicious intent, inconsistent parameter naming (e.g., 'license' parameter).",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. Obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment or anti-tampering. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The obfuscation does not impact security significantly but warrants a higher obfuscated score. Overall, the code is benign and standard for packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent but slightly reduces readability. The scores assigned are appropriate, with malware score at 0, obfuscation around 0.7, and low security risk (~0.15).",
