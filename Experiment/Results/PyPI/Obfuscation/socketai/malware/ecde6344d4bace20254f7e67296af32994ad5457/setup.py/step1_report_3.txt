  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file; hardcoded package metadata variables; list of dependencies; setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "setup() function call with package metadata and dependencies; no direct data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md file content -> storing in 'long_description'; defining package metadata -> passing to setup() -> installation process.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., oFkacROHeyDCvtOHnNKQOCabQfOAqMTD, lnVFdpdcPmHkdiKmYBrRReLVqGSVBqbV) which serve no clear purpose; inconsistent parameter naming in setup(), potential mislabeling of 'license' parameter; unusual variable names for standard setup parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup.py configuration for a Python package. It imports standard modules, reads a README file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and calls setup(). The obfuscated variable names are unusual but do not by themselves indicate malicious intent; they are likely for code obfuscation or simply a coding style. No code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code's structure and behavior align with standard package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The unusual variable names might be for obfuscation but do not imply malicious intent. No security risks are evident from this code snippet.",
