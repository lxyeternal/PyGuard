{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a compatibility and environment setup module, importing various libraries based on Python version and availability.",
  "sources": "Input sources include sys.version_info for Python version detection, module import statements, and conditional imports based on availability.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; the code mainly prepares environment for potential further use.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking Python version, importing modules accordingly, and defining variables, with no data from untrusted sources passed to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of variable names with random-looking strings, conditional imports based on environment, and extensive version-dependent code branching. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection, version compatibility adjustments, and conditional imports of libraries like json, urllib, and collections. It assigns aliases and type tuples for later use. There is no evidence of data leakage, malicious code execution, or backdoors. The obfuscated-like variable names seem intended to make static analysis more difficult but do not reveal malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, system modifications, or malicious behaviors are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a compatibility shim to support multiple Python versions and environments. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The obfuscated variable names may hinder quick understanding but do not indicate malicious behavior.",
