  "purpose": "Environment detection and compatibility setup for Python 2 and 3, involving conditional imports and variable definitions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements for modules like json, urllib, http, io, collections, and environment-specific variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily import and variable assignment logic.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, complex conditional import logic, and environment-specific code paths.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility shim designed to support multiple Python versions. It employs obfuscated variable names and conditional imports to manage differences between Python 2 and 3. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The obfuscation appears to serve concealment or compatibility purposes rather than malicious intent. The code's benign nature is supported by the absence of suspicious data flows or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard cross-version compatibility layer with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The obfuscation is likely for concealment or code generation, not malicious intent.",
