{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up environment-specific imports and type aliases for Python 2 and 3 compatibility, including conditional imports for URL handling, JSON parsing, and other utilities.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements, conditional module imports based on Python version, try-except for optional modules",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data manipulation or data leakage are present",
  "flows": "Imports and conditional assignments do not create data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, complex version-dependent import logic, conditional imports, and extensive aliasing suggest an attempt to obscure code behavior. No explicit malicious functions or code execution found, but the structure is intentionally complicated.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on compatibility across Python versions, importing modules conditionally based on the runtime environment. It employs obfuscated variable names and conditional imports to manage differences between Python 2 and 3. No input sources or output sinks are explicitly handled, nor are there evident data flows from untrusted sources. The complexity and obfuscation could be used to hide malicious behavior, but in this snippet, there is no concrete evidence of malicious actions, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a compatibility shim, which is common in cross-version libraries.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a compatibility layer that manages environment-specific imports and definitions. While its obfuscation and complexity could potentially hide malicious intent, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious data flows within this snippet. Its primary purpose seems to be environment adaptation rather than malicious activity.",
