{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up environment compatibility for different Python versions and modules, particularly handling imports based on Python version, with some variable assignments and import fallbacks.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements, try-except blocks, conditional imports based on Python version",
  "sinks": "None explicitly detected; no untrusted data processing or network operations observed",
  "flows": "No evident data flow from external input sources to sensitive functions or data exfiltration points",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic import fallbacks, multiple version-specific conditional imports, redefinition of built-in types, and complex import logic may suggest attempts at hiding or complicating analysis. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly manages imports depending on the Python version, ensuring compatibility across Python 2 and 3. It defines several variables, some of which are assigned imports or type tuples. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be suspicious but might also be due to code obfuscation or code-generation tools. No network activity, data processing, or execution of untrusted code is observed. No malware signatures or malicious behavior such as backdoors, data theft, or system modifications are evident. The code's complexity and obfuscation techniques are notable but do not directly indicate malicious intent based solely on the provided fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily handles environment compatibility with obfuscated variable names and conditional imports. There is no clear evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation may be a concern but does not inherently imply malicious intent. Overall, this code appears to be standard environment setup with some obfuscation, posing no immediate threat.",
