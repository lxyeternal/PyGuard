      "conclusion": "The code appears primarily benign, functioning as a setup script with obfuscation and some risky practices. No direct malware or malicious payloads are detected, but the use of 'exec' and obfuscation warrants cautious review of the associated files, especially the version file."

No active malicious activity is detected, and malware scores are appropriately zero. Obfuscation scores reflect suspicion but are justified by the embedded content. Overall risk remains low, though continued monitoring is advised."

The high obfuscation is likely for code protection or minification, not malicious intent. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware score remains at 0."

The high obfuscation scores are justified, but malware scores should remain low unless further malicious activity is uncovered. The security risk is low to moderate, primarily due to obfuscation, which could potentially hide malicious intent but does not currently do so."

The anomalies are likely due to data corruption or superficial obfuscation rather than malicious sabotage. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero."

      "conclusion": "The code reviews indicate no confirmed malicious activity across the reports. Obfuscation and minimal code raise some suspicion, especially in Report 4, but without concrete evidence, the malware score should remain low. The scores are mostly appropriate; minor adjustments improve accuracy. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on the available information."
