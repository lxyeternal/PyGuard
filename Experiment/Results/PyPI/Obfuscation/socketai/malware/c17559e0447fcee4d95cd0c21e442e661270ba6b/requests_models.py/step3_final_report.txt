  "purpose": "This code manages HTTP request and response handling, including URL parsing, header management, cookies, and request data preparation.",
  "sources": "URL parsing functions, header validation, request body processing, and cookie handling.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted input is mishandled, but no such flows are evident. No network exfiltration or malicious data transfer is detected.",
  "flows": "Input sources include URL, headers, cookies, and request data; these flow through request preparation functions into network transmission, but no suspicious flows are identified.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation in variable and class names, typical of minified or obfuscated code; no hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated but structurally consistent with a standard HTTP request/response library. No malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage indicators are present. Obfuscation appears to be due to minification or code protection rather than malicious intent. The malware score is 0, risk score is low (~0.2), and obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6). The high obfuscation score reflects the obfuscated naming but does not imply malicious behavior. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, obfuscated open-source HTTP utility library with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The high obfuscation is likely for code protection or minification, not malicious intent. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware score remains at 0.",
