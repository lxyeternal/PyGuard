  "conclusion": "The code reviews indicate no confirmed malicious activity across the reports. Obfuscation and minimal code raise some suspicion, especially in Report 4, but without concrete evidence, the malware score should remain low. The scores are mostly appropriate; minor adjustments improve accuracy. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on the available information."
