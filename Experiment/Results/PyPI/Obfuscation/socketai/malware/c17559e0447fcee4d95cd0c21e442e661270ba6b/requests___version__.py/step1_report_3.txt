{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs some basic operations, possibly involving user input and output.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from user input functions, environment variables, or imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Data output functions, network calls, or file writes that could potentially leak information or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to sinks like output or network functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are observed. No hidden backdoors or suspicious network activity are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward, using standard Python libraries and functions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms. It does not manipulate system files or access sensitive system resources maliciously. The absence of suspicious patterns suggests it is a benign utility or educational script.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely safe, with no indicators of malware or security threats based on the provided code fragment.",
