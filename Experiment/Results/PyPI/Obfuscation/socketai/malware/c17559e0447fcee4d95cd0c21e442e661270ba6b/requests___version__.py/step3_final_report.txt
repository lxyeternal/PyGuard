  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, external modules, network or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks through function calls, data processing, or environment variable usage.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, minimal or unclear code, hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "The provided reports generally describe minimal or straightforward code with no concrete malicious activity. Most scores align with the descriptions, with high confidence in benign assessments. Report 4's suspicion due to obfuscation is justified, but the malware score should be slightly lowered from 0.2 to 0.1 to reflect the lack of direct malicious evidence. The obfuscation score of 0.7 remains appropriate. The security risk score of 0.3 can be maintained or slightly reduced to 0.2 if further evidence suggests lower risk. Overall, the assessments are consistent; the main adjustment is in Report 4's malware score to better match the suspicion level.",
  "conclusion": "The code reviews indicate no confirmed malicious activity across the reports. Obfuscation and minimal code raise some suspicion, especially in Report 4, but without concrete evidence, the malware score should remain low. The scores are mostly appropriate; minor adjustments improve accuracy. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on the available information.",
