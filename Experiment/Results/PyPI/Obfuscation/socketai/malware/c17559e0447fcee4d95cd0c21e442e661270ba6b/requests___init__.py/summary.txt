  "conclusion": "The analyzed code snippets are mainly documentation with obfuscated or corrupted fragments. There is no direct evidence of active malware or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but malware scores should remain low unless further malicious activity is uncovered. The security risk is low to moderate, primarily due to obfuscation, which could potentially hide malicious intent but does not currently do so."
