  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some data processing or utility functions, but no specific purpose is clearly evident from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly shown; the code does not read external inputs or environment variables directly.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls or data outputs, but none are explicitly present or invoked with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No clear data flows from sources to sinks are observable; the code does not process or handle external data streams.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code structure is straightforward and lacks complex dynamic execution or obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The provided code appears to be standard, with no indicators of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, no network connections, nor any signs of data exfiltration. The logic is simple and transparent, with no hidden functionalities or backdoors. Since the snippet is minimal and lacks external dependencies or complex control flows, it does not exhibit typical malware characteristics or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not show any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign, with no evidence of supply chain attacks or malicious modifications.",
