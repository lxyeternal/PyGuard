  "conclusion": "The code is benign in execution but contains embedded suspicious strings suggestive of obfuscation. No active malicious activity is detected, and malware scores are appropriately zero. Obfuscation scores reflect suspicion but are justified by the embedded content. Overall risk remains low, though continued monitoring is advised."
