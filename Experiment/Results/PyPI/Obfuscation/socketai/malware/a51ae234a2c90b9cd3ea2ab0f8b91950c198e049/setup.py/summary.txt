  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, silent execution of a PowerShell command triggered conditionally. The pattern matches typical malware or backdoor behaviors in supply chain scripts. Scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.85, obfuscated ~0.9, security risk ~0.9) are justified and consistent with the observed behavior."
