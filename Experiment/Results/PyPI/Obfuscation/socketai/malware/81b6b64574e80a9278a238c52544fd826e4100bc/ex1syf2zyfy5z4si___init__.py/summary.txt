  "conclusion": "The code in Report 1 demonstrates strong signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying high malware and risk scores. Other reports indicate benign or low-risk code. The overall security posture suggests cautious handling of the dependency, with high suspicion in one report and low suspicion elsewhere. No further modifications are necessary as the scores align with the evidence."
