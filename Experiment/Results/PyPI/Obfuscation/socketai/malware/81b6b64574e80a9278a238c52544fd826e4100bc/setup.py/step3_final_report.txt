  "anomalies": [
    "Heavy obfuscation with complex arithmetic, bitwise operations, dynamic string construction via map and getattr",
    "Nested convoluted conditions and loops",
    "Use of privilege escalation checks and system calls in a concealed manner",
    "Variable names in non-standard characters (e.g., Japanese/Chinese characters)"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code employs extensive obfuscation to hide its true intent, performing system modifications, privilege escalation, and package installation covertly. It uses dynamic string creation and convoluted control flow to evade static detection. The presence of privilege checks and system calls indicates potential malicious activity such as privilege escalation or backdoor setup. The heavy obfuscation and system-level operations strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious and likely malicious, capable of installing packages, creating shortcuts, escalating privileges, and modifying system files covertly. Its obfuscation and system interactions warrant high security concern.",
