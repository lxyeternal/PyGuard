  "purpose": "Importing specific functions or variables from local modules within the package",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .logo, .lan_change, .dccsfb",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in the provided snippet",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; simply importing modules and symbols",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; only straightforward import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists of basic relative import statements, importing specific objects from local modules. There are no dynamic code executions, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or other suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard part of a larger package structure, with no indicators of malicious intent or obfuscation. Since only import statements are present, there are no complex flows or potential vulnerabilities to evaluate beyond the basic safety of imports.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple, benign set of import statements for local modules. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are evident from this fragment.",
