  "purpose": "Import specific objects from local modules within a Python package, likely for module initialization or setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .logo, .lan_change, .dccsfb",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "None; the code only imports objects without data flow or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import statements with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from local modules, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data manipulation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of these imports, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The assessments are consistent and appropriate, reflecting a standard module import pattern in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The import statements are standard and do not pose any threat. The scores and confidence levels are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
