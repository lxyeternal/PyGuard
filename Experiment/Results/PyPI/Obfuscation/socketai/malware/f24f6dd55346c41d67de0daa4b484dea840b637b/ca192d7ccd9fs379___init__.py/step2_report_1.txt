  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation is mentioned.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be standard module imports within a Python package.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is straightforward imports.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence that this is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — still high, given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of analysis:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent and reasonable.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate, given the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- Based solely on this fragment, **no changes are necessary**.\n- The overall risk assessment should remain very low, with all scores at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\nThis assessment aligns with the provided reports and the code snippet.",
