  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions are justified, whether the scores are appropriate, and if any adjustments are needed.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is observed.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The code is part of a typical modular Python package.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Benign import statements; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is straightforward, and the confidence is high.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard local imports with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No issues detected.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Similar benign import statements; no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Slightly less than perfect confidence, but still justified given the simplicity. No reason to change.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Standard import statements, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Again, straightforward imports with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Judgment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the clear import statements.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- Since the code is purely import statements, scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across the board.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across the board.\n- **Risk score:** 0 across the board.\n- **Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:** **0**\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Given the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I concur with the assessments. No evidence suggests malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks in this fragment.",
