  "purpose": "Importing specific functions or objects from local modules within a package, likely for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statements accessing local modules: .logo, .lan_change, .dccsfb.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication observed; import statements do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A — No data flow analysis needed as no functions or data processing is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, which is standard practice for modular Python code. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. Given the minimal content, no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import of local modules and functions, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a normal codebase structure.",
