  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of straightforward relative import statements from local modules.\n   - There are no indications of dynamic code execution, network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n   - The code appears to be a standard part of a package's module structure.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the benign nature of the code and do not overstate potential risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risks of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks, the risk scores are appropriately set to 0.\n   - The code's benign nature justifies this.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - No evidence suggests any malicious intent or payload.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code snippet provided.\n   - The assessment is cautious and appropriate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.** The import statements are standard and do not introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the straightforward, safe nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, benign set of import statements from local modules. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
