  "purpose": "This code imports specific objects or functions from local modules within a package, likely for use elsewhere in the application.",
  "sources": "The source of data is the local modules: logo, lan_change, and dccsfb within the same package.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks involving untrusted data, external network connections, or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; imports are static and limited to local modules.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports from local modules, which is typical in Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The minimal content and structure do not raise any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard module import statements with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe based on this fragment.",
