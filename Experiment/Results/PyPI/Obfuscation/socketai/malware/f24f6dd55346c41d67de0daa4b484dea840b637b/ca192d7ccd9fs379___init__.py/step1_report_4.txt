{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions or variables from local modules for use in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.logo, .lan_change, .dccsfb).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data handling evident.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports symbols and does not process data.",
  "anomalies": "Only simple import statements; no anomalies or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward import statements from local modules, importing variables or functions named 'logo', 'logo2', 'lan_change', and 'dccsfb'. There is no data processing, user input, or external communication. The code appears to serve as an initialization or setup segment for a larger package. No signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard import structure without any malicious indicators or security risks. It appears benign and typical for a Python package module.",
