  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, intended to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; uses obfuscated parameter names and package identifiers within setup()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data flows are present; no network or file operations are evident",
  "flows": "N/A - setup configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated parameter names ('lkoSExWDRmBtQtowYLZSnxUhlQAiFgqo=', 'HkARhpbiErglYIPPBRsEyBKDwPSpTZUg'), nonsensical package name ('ca192d7ccd9fs379'), non-standard setup arguments",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard structure but employs obfuscated and non-standard parameter names, indicating possible obfuscation or malicious intent. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious behavior. The package name and parameters are likely intentionally concealed, which warrants caution. The low malware score (0.2) is appropriate, and the high obfuscation score (0.8) reflects suspicion. The moderate risk score (~0.5) accounts for potential malicious intent hidden behind obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains obfuscated parameter names and package identifiers, raising suspicion but lacking concrete evidence of malicious activity. The low malware score is justified, but the high obfuscation score warrants caution. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended before trusting or deploying this package.",
