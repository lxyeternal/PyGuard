  ],
  "analysis": "The script attempts to perform a typical package setup, reading a README file for description. However, the use of nonsensical keys like 'lkoSExWDRmBtQtowYLZSnxUhlQAiFgqo=' and 'HkARhpbiErglYIPPBRsEyBKDwPSpTZUg' in place of standard setup parameters indicates obfuscation or malicious tampering. These keys are not recognized parameters in setuptools and likely serve to hide or obscure the real intent. The package name appears as a string of random characters, which is suspicious. The dependencies list is stored under a strange key, possibly to conceal or manipulate dependency management. Overall, the code’s structure is typical for a setup script, but the unusual parameters suggest an attempt to hide malicious or maliciously obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script but contains obfuscated parameter names and unusual package naming, indicating potential malicious intent or obfuscation. No direct malicious actions such as network activity or code execution are evident, but the obfuscation itself raises concerns about intent.",
