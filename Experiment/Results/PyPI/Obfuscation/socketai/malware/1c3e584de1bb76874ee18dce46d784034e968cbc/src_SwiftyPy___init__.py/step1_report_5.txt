  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or manipulation, but without specific context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from user input, environment variables, or external files; however, the code does not explicitly show data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions, network communication, or file writing, but none are explicitly present in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are observable in the provided code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code constructs are evident. The code uses standard Python features without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review shows standard Python syntax and library usage. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present. The code's intent is ambiguous, but based on available information, it does not display malicious characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit any malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
