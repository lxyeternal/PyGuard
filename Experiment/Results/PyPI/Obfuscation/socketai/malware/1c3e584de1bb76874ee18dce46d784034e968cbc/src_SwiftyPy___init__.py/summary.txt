  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign; however, report 2's obfuscation and dynamic execution features warrant cautious scoring. Slightly increasing the malware score for report 2 from 0.3 to 0.4 better reflects the suspicion level. The other reports' scores are appropriate and consistent with their content. Overall, the dependency shows no confirmed malicious activity but warrants attention in obfuscated or dynamically executed segments."
