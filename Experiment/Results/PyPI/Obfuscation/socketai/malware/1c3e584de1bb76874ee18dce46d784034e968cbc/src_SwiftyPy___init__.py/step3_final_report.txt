  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input parameters, external modules, configuration files, network connections, system commands, dynamic code execution functions (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, system commands, environment variables, potentially unsafe dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs flow into processing functions, which may then reach sinks like network or system commands, possibly via dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, complex nested functions, use of eval/exec, hardcoded URLs/IPs, lack of comments, dynamic code execution without clear trust boundaries.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in reports 1, 3, 4, and 5, with no signs of malicious activity. Report 2 shows high obfuscation (score 0.7) and signs of dynamic execution, raising suspicion. The malware score for report 2 is initially 0.3, which is conservative given the obfuscation and potential for malicious intent. Considering the suspicion, increasing it slightly to 0.4 improves alignment with observed obfuscation and dynamic patterns. Other scores are consistent with the analysis. No evidence of actual malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system damage, or reverse shells is present. The overall security risk remains moderate, with the highest concern in report 2 due to obfuscation and dynamic code features.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign; however, report 2's obfuscation and dynamic execution features warrant cautious scoring. Slightly increasing the malware score for report 2 from 0.3 to 0.4 better reflects the suspicion level. The other reports' scores are appropriate and consistent with their content. Overall, the dependency shows no confirmed malicious activity but warrants attention in obfuscated or dynamically executed segments.",
