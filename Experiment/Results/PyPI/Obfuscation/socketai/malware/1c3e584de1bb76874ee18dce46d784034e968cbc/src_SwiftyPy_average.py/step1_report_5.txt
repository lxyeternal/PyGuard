{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple function to calculate the integer average of a list of numbers and a trivial function returning a string.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the parameter 'li' in calcAverage().",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input list 'li' to the sum() and len() functions, then to the return statement. The lol() function returns a fixed string without input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The functions are straightforward and do not perform any hidden or malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The calcAverage() function computes the integer division of the sum of list elements by the list length, which is standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The lol() function is trivial and harmless. No hardcoded credentials, external network activity, or security-sensitive operations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, safe, and appears to serve basic utility purposes without any malicious intent or security risks.",
