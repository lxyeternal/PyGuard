{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to calculate the integer average of a list and a simple function returning a string.",
  "sources": "No input reading functions, external data sources, or untrusted data inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external calls, or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two simple functions: one computes an integer average using sum and len, and the other returns a fixed string. There are no inputs, external dependencies, or potentially malicious behaviors. The code appears benign and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It performs basic operations without external interactions or sensitive data handling.",
