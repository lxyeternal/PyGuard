  "purpose": "Calculate the integer average of a list of numbers and provide a trivial function returning 'lol'.",
  "sources": "Input list 'li' in calcAverage function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement in calcAverage; the lol function returning a string.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input list 'li' to the sum and division operations, then to the return. The lol function has no data flow affecting other parts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The functions are straightforward and lack obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple averaging function that performs integer division, which is safe in this context. The lol function is trivial and appears unrelated to any malicious behavior. No external data is read or written, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a basic utility code with no malicious intent.",
