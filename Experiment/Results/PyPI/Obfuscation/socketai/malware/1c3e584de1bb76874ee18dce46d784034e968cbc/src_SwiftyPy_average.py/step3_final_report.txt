{
  "purpose": "The code provides two utility functions: one calculates the integer average of a list, and the other returns a static string 'lol'.",
  "sources": "The functions receive input via parameters: 'li' for calcAverage, no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input 'li' flows into sum and len functions within calcAverage; no other data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing basic arithmetic and returning a static string. There are no external dependencies, no input/output beyond parameters, and no malicious or suspicious constructs. The functions are simple utilities with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The functions perform basic, safe operations, and the code structure is clear and straightforward.",
