  "purpose": "The code provides simple functions for calculating an average of a list and returning a string.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the input list 'li' in 'calcAverage' function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input 'li' flows into 'sum(li)' and 'len(li)' in 'calcAverage', but there are no malicious or harmful flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the functions are straightforward with no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The 'calcAverage' function calculates the integer average of a list by summing the list and dividing by its length, using integer division. The 'lol' function simply returns a string. Both functions are simple, with no input sanitization or external data dependencies. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is clean, minimal, and secure in its current form.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs basic operations without any suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
