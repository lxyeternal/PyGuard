{
  "purpose": "Provides a function to calculate the integer average of a list of numbers and a simple function returning a string.",
  "sources": "Input is taken from the parameter 'li' in calcAverage, which is a list of numbers.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network operations, or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Input data 'li' flows into sum(li) which computes the total; then it's divided by len(li) to produce the average.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The functions are straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The calcAverage function computes an integer division of the sum of the list by its length, which is a common approach but may lead to loss of fractional parts. The lol function simply returns a string. No external dependencies, environment variables, or system calls are present. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected. The code appears to be a basic utility module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free from malicious behavior or security issues. It functions as a simple utility with no suspicious activity.",
