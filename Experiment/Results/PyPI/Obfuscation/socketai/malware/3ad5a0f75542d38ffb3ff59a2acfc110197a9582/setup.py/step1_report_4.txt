{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup command that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with parameters containing system info sent to a remote URL",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources flows into the requests.get() call, which transmits data to an external server",
  "anomalies": "The code uses non-descriptive, obfuscated class and method names; it transmits collected data to a suspicious domain; no user consent or notification is apparent",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the 'install' command of setuptools to execute additional actions during package installation. It collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data to a remote server 'cdf7ymt2vtc0000eer0gggz6haayyyyyf.oast.fun'. This behavior appears covert, potentially for data exfiltration, without user awareness or consent. The code's obfuscated class and method names, combined with data transmission to an untrusted domain, strongly suggest malicious intent. No other malicious activities like file manipulation, code execution, or backdoors are evident, but the data exfiltration alone is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior, specifically secret data collection and transmission to an external server, likely for tracking or exfiltration purposes. The obfuscation and lack of transparency increase the suspicion. It should be considered malicious, and its use is unsafe.",
