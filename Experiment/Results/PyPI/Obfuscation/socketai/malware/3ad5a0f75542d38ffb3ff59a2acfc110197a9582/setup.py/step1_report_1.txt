  "purpose": "Custom setup script that extends the install command to send system information to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call with system info as parameters to a suspicious domain",
  "flows": "Source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> Data assembled into dictionary -> Sent via requests.get() to remote URL",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, unusual domain for data exfiltration, no user-facing prompts or legitimate reason for data transmission",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that gathers system hostname, current working directory, and username. These details are then sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain, likely for tracking or data exfiltration. The obfuscated class and method names, along with the unknown domain, indicate malicious intent. No legitimate use case for such data transmission during package installation is evident, and the code executes a network request with system data, which is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system info and sending it to a suspicious server during installation. The obfuscation and remote request indicate a potential supply chain attack or privacy violation.",
