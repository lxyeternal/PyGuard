  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that customizes the installation process.",
  "sources": "Socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), requests.get()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call with untrusted parameters",
  "flows": "Retrieving hostname, current working directory, and username as sources; then sending this data to an external domain via requests.get() as sink",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, unusual data exfiltration behavior during installation, data sent to a suspicious domain without user consent",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class inheriting from setuptools. During installation, it gathers system information (hostname, current directory, username) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external domain. The code uses obfuscated class and method names, which are typical indicators of malicious intent or attempt to hide behavior. Data exfiltration during package installation is suspicious, especially without user knowledge or consent. The external domain is unlikely to be related to legitimate package functionality, indicating potential privacy invasion or malicious tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code attempts to collect and exfiltrate system information during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It could be used for tracking, data theft, or other malicious purposes. The obfuscation and behavior warrant a security warning and should be reviewed before use.",
