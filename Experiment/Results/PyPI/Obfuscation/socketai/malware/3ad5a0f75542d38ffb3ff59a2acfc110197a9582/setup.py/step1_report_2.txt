{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser(), which gather system hostname, current working directory, and username respectively.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function is used to send the collected system data to a remote URL, which could be exploited for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The data collected from hostname, current working directory, and username flows directly into the params argument of requests.get() for transmission to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The remote domain (cdf7ymt2vtc0000eer0gggz6haayyyyyf.oast.fun) appears suspicious and is likely used for data collection or command and control. The code executes during the setup process, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon execution, collects hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain. The obfuscated naming and the timing of data exfiltration during setup are indicative of malicious activity. The remote URL is unusual and possibly malicious, designed to harvest user system info without user consent. The use of standard libraries is benign, but their purpose here is suspicious. No other malicious behaviors like code injection or backdoors are observed, but the data exfiltration pattern is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and transmitting it to a suspicious external server during package installation. The obfuscation and timing increase the suspicion of malicious intent. The package should be considered potentially harmful and avoided.",
