{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup installer that, during installation, gathers system information and sends it to an external URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname (`socket.gethostname()`), current working directory (`os.getcwd()`), and username (`getpass.getuser()`).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data is sent via an HTTP GET request to 'cdf7ymt2vtc0000eer0gggz6haayyyyyf.oast.fun'.",
  "flows": "Data collected from system info sources flows directly into the URL request as parameters, potentially transmitting sensitive data to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The URL used ('cdf7ymt2vtc0000eer0gggz6haayyyyyf.oast.fun') appears suspicious, likely a temporary or testing domain. The code actively exfiltrates system info during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The code name and class name are obfuscated and do not reflect standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the standard setuptools installation process to include a call that gathers hostname, current directory, and username. These data points are then sent to an external URL via an HTTP GET request. This behavior is not typical for a standard setup script and suggests data exfiltration. The URL appears suspicious, possibly used for malicious purposes. No other malicious or sabotage code, such as destructive actions or hidden backdoors, is evident. The obfuscation of class and method names indicates an attempt to conceal behavior. Overall, the script performs covert data transmission during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation without user consent. The use of an obfuscated class and method, combined with communication to a suspicious URL, indicates a likely malicious intent. It should be considered high risk for security and supply chain integrity.",
