  "purpose": "Decode and execute a marshaled and base64-encoded payload, likely malicious.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string decoded via base64.b64decode; marshaled data loaded with marshal.loads().",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing the unmarshaled code, which may contain further malicious operations.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoding -> marshal.loads() -> exec() on the resulting code object.",
  "anomalies": "Use of marshal.loads() on external data combined with exec(), embedded URLs within the payload, heavy obfuscation via base64 and marshal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports base64 and marshal, decodes a base64 string, unmarshals it, and executes it. The payload contains embedded URLs and is heavily obfuscated, indicating malicious intent. The use of marshal.loads() on external data and exec() is a common pattern in malware to evade static analysis. The embedded URLs suggest potential command-and-control or data exfiltration. The obfuscation and dynamic execution significantly increase the risk profile. All indicators point to malicious behavior with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, employing obfuscation and dynamic code execution techniques typical of malware loaders. Embedded URLs and the use of marshal.loads() with exec() strongly suggest malicious intent, including remote command execution or data theft. The malware score should be set to 1, and the security risk score should also be 1, reflecting the high threat level.",
