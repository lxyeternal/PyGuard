{
  "purpose": "This code is a minimal setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata with static values.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded strings and lists within the script, notably the package name, version, license, keywords, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted input or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply passes static data to the setup function.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated, unused variable named 'mOZqVHKxURsOjBVZLYGYePndPWGvwaST' assigned an empty list; the 'keywords' list is empty. The variable's name suggests obfuscation, but it is not used elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The only suspicious element is the obfuscated, unused variable, which could be an attempt at obfuscation or a placeholder. No external inputs, network activity, or code execution occurs. The low malware scores across reports align with the static, benign nature of this snippet. The obfuscation score is higher due to the variable name, but without active malicious code, the overall risk remains low.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with the main concern being obfuscation through a nonsensical variable name that is unused. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or active exploits. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate, though the obfuscation warrants cautious review if part of a larger package.",
