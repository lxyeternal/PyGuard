      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup. The tactics used are characteristic of malware, warranting high security concern. The scores in the reports are appropriate, and further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm payload intent."
