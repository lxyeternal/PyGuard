      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, designed for credential theft, data exfiltration, and system espionage via a Discord bot with obfuscation. Despite some incomplete or pseudo-code segments, the core malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports—malware at 1.0, security risk at 1.0, and obfuscation around 0.8—are justified given the evidence. The overall threat level is maximum, and the code should be treated as severe malware."
