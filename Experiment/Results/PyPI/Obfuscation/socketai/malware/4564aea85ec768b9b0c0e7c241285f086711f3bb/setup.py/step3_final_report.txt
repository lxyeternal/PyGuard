{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring metadata and dependencies with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated variable assignments and parameter values within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, code execution, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no active data flow or malicious logic detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable names, nonsensical parameter assignments (e.g., 'text/markdown' assigned to variables), and malformed parameters suggest concealment or poor coding practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and misplaced string assignments. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The malformed parameters and strange strings are anomalies but could be benign or indicative of concealment. The dependencies are typical packages. The scores from reports align with these observations, assigning high obfuscation scores (~0.75), low malware scores (~0.1-0.2), and moderate security risk (~0.2-0.3).",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script with suspicious obfuscation. No active malicious behavior is detected in this fragment. The obfuscation warrants further review of the entire package, but based solely on this, the risk is low.",
