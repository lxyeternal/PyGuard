{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'ded0x3sw9lou88w6', likely used for package distribution and dependency management.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata and a list of dependencies under 'cdLctJLAqcOgwRqdQjHnxWnFasydXppl'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or code execution are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The setup function uses hardcoded metadata and dependencies; no dynamic data flow or user input handling is observed.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names ('NFFzTWUyzRTksJJAicyUYRsPcQBQhpIW', 'cdLctJLAqcOgwRqdQjHnxWnFasydXppl') are obfuscated and non-descriptive, which is unusual for a standard setup script. The presence of nonsensical variable names suggests obfuscation or concealment of intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for package setup. It defines metadata with hardcoded values, some of which are obfuscated or nonsensical, such as 'NFFzTWUyzRTksJJAicyUYRsPcQBQhpIW=' assigned to a string 'text/markdown', which appears misplaced. The dependencies are listed under an obfuscated variable name, but they are typical Python packages (requests, sockets, pypiwin32, pycryptodome, uuid). No dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious network activity is evident. The obfuscated variable names could indicate an attempt to conceal malicious intent, but in this context, they merely make the code less readable without clear malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to perform standard package configuration with obfuscated variable names. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code snippet. The obfuscation might be a red flag for concealment, but on its own, it does not confirm malicious intent.",
