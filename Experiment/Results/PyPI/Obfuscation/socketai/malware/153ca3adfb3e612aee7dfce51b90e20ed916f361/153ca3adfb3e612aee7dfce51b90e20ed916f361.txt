      "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious, employing extensive obfuscation and system modifications indicative of malicious intent. It should be treated as a high-severity security threat, warranting quarantine, further dynamic analysis, and removal from supply chains."

      "conclusion": "The code analysis indicates no confirmed malicious behavior across the reports. Suspicion in report 2 is based on code patterns rather than confirmed payloads. The scores are consistent with the descriptions, with moderate concern in report 2 and minimal or no concern in others. No adjustments are necessary; the overall security posture appears acceptable with standard caution for dynamic code execution scenarios."
