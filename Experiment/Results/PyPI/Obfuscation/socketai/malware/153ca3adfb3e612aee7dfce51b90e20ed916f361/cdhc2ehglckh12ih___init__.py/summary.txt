  "conclusion": "The code analysis indicates no confirmed malicious behavior across the reports. Suspicion in report 2 is based on code patterns rather than confirmed payloads. The scores are consistent with the descriptions, with moderate concern in report 2 and minimal or no concern in others. No adjustments are necessary; the overall security posture appears acceptable with standard caution for dynamic code execution scenarios."
