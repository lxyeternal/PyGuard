  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of system commands if present, but none are explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Without specific code, no source-to-sink data flow can be identified; normally, this would involve untrusted input passing through processing to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code patterns are observable without the code snippet.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of the actual code, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Generally, the review would include checking for untrusted input handling, suspicious external calls, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information is provided to determine if the code contains malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign based on the available context but cannot be definitively evaluated.",
