  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen command execution, remote URL download, file extraction, execution of scripts",
  "flows": "Code checks for directory -> Executes PowerShell command to download and run remote updater script",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded URL for updater.zip, execution of remote code via PowerShell, use of hidden process execution, calling of WScript.exe and powershell.exe with obfuscated commands",
  "analysis": "The script begins by checking for a specific directory, then runs a PowerShell command that silently downloads a ZIP archive from an external URL. The ZIP file is expanded into a system directory, then scripts are executed via hidden processes, potentially loading malicious payloads. The setup function installs numerous packages, but this is standard. The core suspicious activity is the remote code download and execution without any verification or validation, indicating a high risk of malicious activity. The code uses obfuscated process calls to hide its intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code actively downloads and executes remote content without validation, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. It appears designed to silently install or run malicious payloads, representing a significant security risk.",
