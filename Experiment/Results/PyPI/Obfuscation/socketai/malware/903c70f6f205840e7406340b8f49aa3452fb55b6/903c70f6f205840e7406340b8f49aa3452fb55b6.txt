      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malware, including remote code download, silent execution, obfuscation, and persistence mechanisms. The external URL is untrusted, and the code runs scripts without validation, indicating malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9, obfuscated 0.8, risk 0.9) are justified and reflect a high probability of malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "This code is a heavily obfuscated terminal UI utility library with no malicious behavior detected. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware potential remains very low. The overall security risk is minimal, though caution with obfuscated code in supply chain contexts is advisable."
