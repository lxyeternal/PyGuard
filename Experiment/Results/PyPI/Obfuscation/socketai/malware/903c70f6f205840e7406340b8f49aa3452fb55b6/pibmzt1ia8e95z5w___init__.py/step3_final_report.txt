  "purpose": "Heavily obfuscated terminal UI utility library for cursor control, colors, banners, borders, and animations.",
  "sources": "Reads user input, terminal size, environment info; no network or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Writes to stdout, executes system commands (_system()), ANSI escape sequences.",
  "flows": "User input influences display; no untrusted data flows into system/network.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with obscure class/method names, complex string manipulations, threading, delays, placeholder comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex terminal UI toolkit with functions for cursor positioning, color formatting, banners, borders, and animations. It uses system commands like 'cls', 'clear', and 'title' for terminal control, and employs threading and delays for animations. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are evident. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment or complexity, not malicious intent. The functions are typical for terminal effects, and no dangerous system calls or external dependencies are involved in malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a heavily obfuscated terminal UI utility library with no malicious behavior detected. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware potential remains very low. The overall security risk is minimal, though caution with obfuscated code in supply chain contexts is advisable.",
