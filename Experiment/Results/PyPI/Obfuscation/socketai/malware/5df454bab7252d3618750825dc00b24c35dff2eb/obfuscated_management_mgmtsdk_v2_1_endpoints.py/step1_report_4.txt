{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants for API endpoint URLs used in a cybersecurity management system, facilitating interactions with various subsystems such as threats, agents, ranger, remote scripts, and marketplace.",
  "sources": "Constants are assigned string URL patterns, some of which include format placeholders (e.g., '{}') for dynamic URL generation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; these are URL patterns used for API calls. Potential issues could arise if these URLs are used insecurely elsewhere, but within this code, no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code provides static URL templates. Actual data flow depends on how these URLs are used in API requests elsewhere in the application.",
  "anomalies": "All variables are straightforward string URL patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. No unusual or suspicious code behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains constants for API endpoint paths, some with format placeholders for dynamic substitution. No dynamic code execution, input processing, or data handling is present. The URL patterns correspond to various operational functionalities like threat management, agent control, ranger, remote scripts, and marketplace integrations. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security-related anomalies. All definitions appear standard for a large API-based system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a list of API endpoint URL patterns intended for use in a cybersecurity management system. It does not include executable logic, input handling, or network communication code. Based on this, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this fragment.",
