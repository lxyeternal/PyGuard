  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code consists solely of static string constants defining API endpoints. It notes the absence of data flows, execution, or obfuscation. The conclusion that there's no malicious code or security risk is accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The confidence is 1, which is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly states that these are string constants for API paths, with no dynamic or malicious content. No signs of backdoors or malicious behavior are present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Confidence=1. This aligns well.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is just static URL patterns with placeholders, used for API requests. No dynamic code, data processing, or malicious content is detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The report emphasizes that these are URL patterns with placeholders, used for API interactions. No malicious code or obfuscation. It notes that misuse could occur if variables are improperly sanitized, but that’s a general concern outside this code snippet.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.95. The high risk score might be slightly overcautious since these are just constants, but the report justifies it by potential misuse if used insecurely elsewhere.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly conservative but justifiable. No malicious content detected here.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, it recognizes these are static URL definitions with placeholders, with no code execution or malicious behavior. It notes a minimal security risk if URLs are used insecurely, which is a standard consideration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Confidence=0.9. This seems reasonable given the context.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that these are static API endpoint constants.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present.\n- The only minor point is the slightly elevated risk score in Report 4, justified by potential misuse if these URLs are used insecurely elsewhere, not within this code snippet.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no inherent security risk in static constants; potential misuse is outside the scope of this code snippet)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese constants are standard, benign, and serve as configuration data for API interactions. There is no indication of malicious or suspicious activity in this code snippet.",
