  "purpose": "Defines static URL endpoint constants for API interactions in a cybersecurity system.",
  "sources": "Static string constants representing API endpoint paths, some with placeholders for dynamic insertion.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A; purely static constants with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static string definitions with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants used as API endpoint paths, some with placeholders for dynamic URL parts. There is no execution, data processing, or dynamic behavior. No signs of obfuscation, embedded secrets, or malicious code are present. The URLs are structured and named consistently with typical API design. Minor concerns about potential misuse if variables are improperly sanitized are noted, but this is outside the scope of static constants. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.05-0.1), reflecting the benign nature of these definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of static API endpoint constants. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The slight potential for misuse if these URLs are used insecurely elsewhere does not reflect an actual vulnerability within this code snippet.",
