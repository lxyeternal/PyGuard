  "purpose": "Definition of API endpoint paths for various threat, agent, ranger, application, and upgrade management operations.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments defining API endpoint URL paths.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing or untrusted data usage observed.",
  "flows": "No dynamic or user-controlled data flows; static URL path definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code consists solely of string constants used for API endpoints.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive list of string constants representing API endpoint URLs for various system functions such as threat management, agent actions, ranger device review, application management, and upgrade policies. All entries are static string assignments with no dynamic evaluation, user input, or obfuscated code. No signs of malicious behavior, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The data appears to be configuration or constants for API interactions, and no evidence suggests malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration of API endpoint paths used within a larger system. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be part of a safe, structured codebase with no malicious or suspicious content.",
