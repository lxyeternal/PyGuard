  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports identify that the code consists solely of static string constants defining API endpoint paths.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, or untrusted data handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The URLs are structured and named in a manner consistent with typical security management systems.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** The code is a set of URL constants for API interactions, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, comprehensive list of endpoint constants with no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Defines static URL patterns with placeholders, used for API request construction.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct. No evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, straightforward URL patterns with placeholders.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate. No malicious or suspicious content.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Slightly more cautious, noting potential misuse if variables are untrusted.\n- **Analysis:** While the report mentions that improper use of variables could introduce security issues, the code snippet itself is just static URL definitions. The risk arises only if these URLs are constructed insecurely elsewhere.\n- **Conclusion:** The code itself is benign. The mention of potential misuse is valid but does not imply malicious intent in the code snippet.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — acceptable, given the cautious note.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Assessment:\n- All reports agree that the code is a collection of static API endpoint constants.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The only concern is potential misuse if these URL patterns are used insecurely elsewhere, but that is outside the scope of this static code review.\n\n### My own evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, straightforward string constants.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk inherent in static URL definitions; risk could only arise from how they are used elsewhere.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is benign, well-structured, and typical for API endpoint configuration in a security platform. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and benign nature.",
