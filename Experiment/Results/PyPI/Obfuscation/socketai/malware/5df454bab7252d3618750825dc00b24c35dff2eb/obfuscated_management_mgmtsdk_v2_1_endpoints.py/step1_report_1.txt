  "purpose": "Definition of URL endpoint constants for API interactions within a cybersecurity management system",
  "sources": "String assignments and format strings defining API endpoint paths",
  "sinks": "None; no execution, data processing, or untrusted data handling evident",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only static string definitions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; mostly straightforward URL path constants",
  "analysis": "The code consists of numerous string constants defining API endpoint paths used in a security platform. There is consistent use of string formatting for dynamic endpoints. No code execution, network calls, or data handling occurs within this snippet. The constants are purely declarative and serve as configuration or constants for the application. There are no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious constructs. The structure and naming conventions appear normal for a codebase managing API endpoints for threat detection, agent management, network controls, and other security functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static endpoint URL constants for a security management platform. It does not contain malicious code, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation. The code's purpose appears to be organized API path definitions, with no evident security risks or malware. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
