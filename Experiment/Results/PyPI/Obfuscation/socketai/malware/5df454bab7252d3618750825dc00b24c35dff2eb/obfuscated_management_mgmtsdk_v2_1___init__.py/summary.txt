  "conclusion": "The code reviews indicate no confirmed malicious activity but identify features that could be exploited maliciously. The primary concern is dynamic code execution and hardcoded secrets in Report 4, warranting an increased malware risk score. Scores across other reports are consistent with their limited data. Adjusting Report 4's malware score to approximately 0.4 enhances the accuracy of risk assessment without overestimating threat levels."
