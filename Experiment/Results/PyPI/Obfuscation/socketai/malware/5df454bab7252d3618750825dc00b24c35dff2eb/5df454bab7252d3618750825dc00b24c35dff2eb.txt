      "conclusion": "The code functions as a complex, obfuscated filtering utility without evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware scores should remain at 0 or very low, as no malicious actions are demonstrated. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to obfuscation, which warrants cautious review if used in production, but no active threat is identified."

      "conclusion": "The code reviews indicate no confirmed malicious activity but identify features that could be exploited maliciously. The primary concern is dynamic code execution and hardcoded secrets in Report 4, warranting an increased malware risk score. Scores across other reports are consistent with their limited data. Adjusting Report 4's malware score to approximately 0.4 enhances the accuracy of risk assessment without overestimating threat levels."

Without evidence of malicious activity, it should be considered safe, but the invocation warrants review of the api module to ensure it does not perform unsafe operations."
