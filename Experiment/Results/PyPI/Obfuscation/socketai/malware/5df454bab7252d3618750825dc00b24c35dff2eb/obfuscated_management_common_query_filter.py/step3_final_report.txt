  "purpose": "Defines classes for filtering query parameters with validation and dynamic filter construction.",
  "sources": "Class attributes defining operators, input parameters to methods, filter argument dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Internal dictionaries storing filter conditions; no external system calls or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into validation methods, then into internal filter dictionaries via method calls.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical class and variable names; dynamic attribute handling; complex validation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated, making understanding difficult. It implements filter management, operator validation, and dynamic key generation. No system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. The obfuscation could be used to hide malicious intent, but in this snippet, no malicious actions are evident. The validation logic appears standard, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The obfuscation and complexity are suspicious but not conclusive of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a complex, obfuscated filtering utility without evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware scores should remain at 0 or very low, as no malicious actions are demonstrated. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to obfuscation, which warrants cautious review if used in production, but no active threat is identified.",
