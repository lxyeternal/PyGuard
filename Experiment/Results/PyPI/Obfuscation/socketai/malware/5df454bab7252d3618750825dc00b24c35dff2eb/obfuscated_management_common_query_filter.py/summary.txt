  "conclusion": "The code functions as a complex, obfuscated filtering utility without evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware scores should remain at 0 or very low, as no malicious actions are demonstrated. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to obfuscation, which warrants cautious review if used in production, but no active threat is identified."
