{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define classes for filtering and constructing query filters, likely for API or database querying.",
  "sources": "Imports from an external module, class attributes, and method parameters used as input data sources.",
  "sinks": "Construction of filter dictionaries, string formatting for filter keys, and potential exception messages.",
  "flows": "Input data from class attributes or method parameters flows into filter construction and validation logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names, dynamic method and class construction, no apparent external data validation, and complex exception handling. No hardcoded credentials or obvious malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes with obfuscated names, likely to hinder readability. The main class 'ANquOsWUgHyeafAyzGOIFISBKEkEJzyq' manages filter creation with methods that validate input and construct filter dictionaries, including operator validation. Subclasses extend the filter options, adding specific fields. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or system modifications. The obfuscation and complex logic might be intended to disguise the code's purpose but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, unsafe code, or malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated, complex filtering utility designed for query construction, with no clear signs of malicious behavior or malware. Its obfuscation may be suspicious but is not definitively malicious. Overall, the package does not pose a security threat based on the provided code.",
