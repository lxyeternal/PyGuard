  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network connections, eval/exec functions, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration points, network communications, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network data flow into eval/exec or data handling functions, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, suspicious data flows, hardcoded credentials, use of eval/exec with untrusted input.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns, with potential data exfiltration or backdoor behaviors. No concrete malicious payloads are confirmed, but the presence of obfuscation and suspicious data flows warrants cautious scoring. The code's benign nature in some reports aligns with the absence of malicious activity, while obfuscation and dynamic code patterns increase suspicion. The scores should reflect the uncertainty and potential threat level.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows significant obfuscation and potential malicious indicators but lacks confirmed malicious actions. The overall security risk is moderate, with a malware score indicating suspicion but not definitive malicious activity. Further deobfuscation and analysis are recommended for conclusive assessment.",
