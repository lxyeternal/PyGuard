{
  "purpose": "This code is a minimal setup script for a Python package, importing 'setuptools', defining a version, and calling 'setup()' with a package name, version, and license.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; the only data source is the static package name and license string within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows; the script does not process external data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'drlzhz7vj3kkp71q' appears as a random string, which is unusual and could be used to obscure intent, but no malicious code or obfuscation techniques are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, minimal setup script with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or suspicious operations. The only notable anomaly is the package name, which is a non-descriptive, seemingly random string. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The unused 'find_packages()' import is a minor inefficiency but not a security concern. The license 'SentinelOne' is a known cybersecurity company but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is set to 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code. The security risk score is slightly elevated (~0.1-0.2) due to the suspicious package name but remains low because no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with an unusual package name that warrants cautious monitoring but does not indicate malicious behavior. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the overall security risk is minimal. The suspicion is solely based on the package name, not on any malicious code or obfuscation.",
