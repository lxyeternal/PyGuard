  "purpose": "Define and configure the package setup for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines static variables and calls setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is sent or written insecurely.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static data used for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The package name appears as a random string, which may be suspicious; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' modules for package setup, defines a package version, and calls 'setup' with a package name, version, and license. The package name 'drlzhz7vj3kkp71q' looks like a randomly generated string, which can be suspicious as it may be used to obscure the package's purpose or origin. No code injection, dynamic execution, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is minimal and standard for package configuration. The license is specified as 'SentinelOne', which is a known cybersecurity company, but this alone is not suspicious. Overall, the code appears benign but the package name warrants cautious review if downloaded from untrusted sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard setup for a Python package with no malicious behavior detected. The unusual package name is notable but not inherently malicious. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
