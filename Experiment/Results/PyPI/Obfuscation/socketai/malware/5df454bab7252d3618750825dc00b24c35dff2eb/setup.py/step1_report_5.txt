{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'setuptools' functions and defines package version and name inline.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input handling, no data leaks or sensitive data exposure present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only sets up package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'drlzhz7vj3kkp71q' appears to be a randomized string, which could be suspicious, but not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions from setuptools, assigns a version string, and calls setup() with a package name, version, and license. It does not perform any network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The package name looks like a randomized or obfuscated string, which could be used to hide malicious intent, but by itself, it is not proof of malicious behavior. The code is minimal and standard for package setup, with no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward package setup script with an unusual package name. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior detected. The package name might warrant further investigation for intent, but the script itself is benign.",
