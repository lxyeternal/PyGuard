  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution using setuptools",

  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static metadata assignment",
  "anomalies": "Package name appears as a random string, potentially suspicious; minimal metadata; no use of find_packages() despite import",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions, assigns a version string, and calls setup() with minimal metadata. The package name 'drlzhz7vj3kkp71q' is non-descriptive and appears random, which could be suspicious but not malicious by itself. No data input or untrusted sources are involved. There are no malicious code constructs, backdoors, or malicious behaviors present. The imported find_packages is unused, which is inefficient but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple package setup script with an unusual package name. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The main concern is the suspicious package name, which could be used to obscure malicious intent, but on its own, this code does not exhibit malicious activity.",
