  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; setup configuration is static",
  "anomalies": "Package name appears obfuscated or non-descriptive, but no malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for packaging purposes and sets package metadata such as name, version, and license. The package name 'drlzhz7vj3kkp71q' is unusual and non-descriptive, which could be suspicious, but it is not inherently malicious. There are no input/output data flows, no dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or other suspicious patterns. The code is minimal and standard for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic package setup script with a non-descriptive package name. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident from this snippet.",
