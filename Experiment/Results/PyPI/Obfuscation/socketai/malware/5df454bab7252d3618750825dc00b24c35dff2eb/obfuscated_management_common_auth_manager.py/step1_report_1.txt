  "purpose": "Define a class that appears to set up headers and a token attribute, potentially for HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Initialization of class attributes: 'self.CyazzYSoUjXnvzWuYqBiuFgYJILShmkn', 'self.QTTAJnvyjdOJIXPqCpnyJcTBRVhCpaOB', and 'self.token'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this code snippet; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident; the code only initializes attributes without further actions.",
  "anomalies": "Class name is nonsensical and obfuscated; attribute names are also obscure, which could be intentional obfuscation but are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an obfuscated name and initializes two dictionaries and a token attribute set to None. No functions or methods that handle input, external communication, or sensitive operations are present. The obfuscation could be to conceal purpose, but there's no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign class initialization with obfuscated naming. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
