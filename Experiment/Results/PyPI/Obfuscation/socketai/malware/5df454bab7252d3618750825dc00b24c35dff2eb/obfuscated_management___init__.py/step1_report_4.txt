  "purpose": "Set up logging configuration for the 'MgmtSdk' module, including log level and log file path based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'; system information via sys.platform; environment variables for log configuration.",
  "sinks": "Logging handlers write logs to files and stdout; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log file path and log level; configuration functions set up handlers based on these variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names with no apparent purpose; no other suspicious code behavior; code is heavily obfuscated through naming but functionally straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logging setup function that configures file and stream handlers with levels based on environment variables. It uses obfuscated variable names, which could be suspicious, but no malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful actions is evident. The environment-driven configuration is common for flexible logging. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard logging configuration with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent. It simply sets up logging handlers based on environment variables. There is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
