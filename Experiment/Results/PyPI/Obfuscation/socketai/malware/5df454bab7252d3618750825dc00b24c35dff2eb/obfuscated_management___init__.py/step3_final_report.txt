  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers based on environment variables, setting up file and stdout logging for the 'MgmtSdk' logger.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH' and 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL'; os.environ.get for configuration; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Logging handlers writing to a file specified by environment variables and to stdout.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log file path and level; handlers process logs and output accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no suspicious code or network activity; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logger with file and stream handlers, configurable via environment variables. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated but serve only to obscure the code's purpose. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The obfuscation appears to be solely for concealment, not malicious intent. The logging setup is standard and benign, with no vulnerabilities or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, environment-configurable logging setup with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
