  "purpose": "Configure logging for a management SDK, setting up log file and console handlers with dynamic log levels and paths.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS' for log path, level, and handler activation.",
  "sinks": "Logging handlers write to specified log file or stdout, but no data is sent externally or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log configuration; log handlers process and output logs locally.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, which do not contribute to functionality clarity, but are not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logging configuration that uses environment variables to determine log file location and log level. It includes custom formatting and dual handlers (file and stdout). Variable names appear intentionally obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward and consistent with standard logging setup. No data exfiltration, network connections, or malicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated malicious code, or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard logging configuration with obfuscated variable names, likely for obscurity. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this code fragment.",
