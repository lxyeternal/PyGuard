  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers for a management SDK, including file and console logging, with dynamic log level and path settings based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH' and 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL'; system platform detection; 'os' and 'sys' modules for system info.",
  "sinks": "Logging to a file at a path determined by environment variables; printing logs to stdout.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log file path and level -> Log handlers are created -> Log messages are output to file and stdout.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names which may obscure intent; no hardcoded secrets; logging configuration appears standard. No suspicious code execution or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger with a specific name and sets up log handlers based on environment variables. It dynamically determines the log file location and log level. The use of environment variables for configuration is typical. The variable naming appears intentionally obscure, but there is no malicious pattern such as network activity, data theft, or backdoors. The code does not perform any suspicious or harmful actions beyond standard logging setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logging configuration with obfuscated variable names, likely to obscure its purpose. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The overall security risk is low, with no apparent security threats or malicious behavior.",
