{
  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers and levels for an SDK or application, writing logs to a file and stdout.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH' and 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL' for log file location and log level; environment variable 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS' for enabling default handlers.",
  "sinks": "Log file written at the path specified by 'SDK_LOG_PATH'; logs output to stdout.",
  "flows": "Environment variables determine log path and level -> Handlers format and output logs -> Log messages are generated and written to file and stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden code; variable names are obfuscated but seem to serve normal functions.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logging configuration based on environment variables, with a default log file location and log level. It creates a file handler and stream handler, attaches them to a logger, and sets the log level accordingly. The code only deals with logging setup and does not execute any external network requests, system modifications, or data collection. No malicious or malicious-looking patterns are present. The obfuscated variable names do not appear to serve malicious purposes, possibly just obfuscation. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate logging setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging configuration script that dynamically sets log file location and level based on environment variables. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No signs of malware or supply chain sabotage are evident.",
