  "purpose": "A minimal Python setup script for package configuration.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, assignment of obfuscated variable, static setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are used.",
  "flows": "Unused obfuscated variable assigned a string; setup() called with static parameters; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name, unusual package name, and license string 'SentinelOne'. The variable is unused, indicating superficial obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script importing standard functions, defining an obfuscated variable, and calling setup() with static, benign parameters. No dynamic data, network activity, or code execution occurs. The obfuscated variable is unused, serving no functional purpose, likely for concealment. The license string 'SentinelOne' is just a string parameter, not indicative of malicious intent. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as no malicious behavior is present. Obfuscation scores vary but are justified given the variable and package names. The overall security risk is negligible. The code's benign nature and static structure support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or malicious intent are evident. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
