  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that gathers system information and sends it to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), socket.getfqdn(), socket.gethostbyname(), socket.gethostbyaddr(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to a suspicious domain with collected system info as parameters",
  "flows": "system info collected from hostname, current directory, FQDN, IP address, username flows into the requests.get() call to send data to external server",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, sending system info to an external server during package installation, unusual collection of hostname, fqdn, IP, username, and posting to a suspicious domain",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from setuptools' install command, overriding its method to collect system information such as hostname, current working directory, fully qualified domain name, IP address, and username. It then sends this data via a GET request to a potentially malicious domain. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code executes during package installation, which could be used for unauthorized tracking or information gathering without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely malicious as it secretly collects system information and transmits it to an external server during package installation, indicating potential privacy violation or malicious surveillance. The obfuscation and external communication are suspicious behaviors.",
