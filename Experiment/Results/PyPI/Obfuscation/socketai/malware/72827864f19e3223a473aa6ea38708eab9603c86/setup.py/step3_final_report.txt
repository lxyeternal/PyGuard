{
  "purpose": "The code overrides the setuptools install command to collect system information (hostname, current directory, fqdn, IP address, username) and exfiltrate it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), socket.getfqdn(), socket.gethostbyname(), socket.gethostbyaddr(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call sending data to external URL",
  "flows": "Data collected from system info functions flows into the requests.get() call, which transmits it to the external server during setup",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, use of socket and getpass modules for data collection, contact with a suspicious external URL during package installation",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert collection of system information and exfiltrates it during the package installation process, indicating malicious intent. The obfuscation of class and method names suggests an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. The URL contacted is unrelated to package functionality and appears suspicious. The data flow from system info sources to the external URL via requests.get() confirms data exfiltration. The high obfuscation score reflects the obfuscated naming, and the high malware and security risk scores are justified by the covert data collection and exfiltration activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, acting as a backdoor to exfiltrate system information during package installation. The obfuscation and contact with a suspicious URL strongly indicate malicious intent, constituting a supply chain attack vector. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior.",
