  "purpose": "This code defines a custom setup process that collects system information and sends it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), socket.getfqdn(), socket.gethostbyname(), socket.gethostbyaddr(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to a remote URL with system information as parameters",
  "flows": "System info collected from sources is compiled into a dictionary and sent via an HTTP GET request to an external domain during package installation",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming conventions for classes and functions, sending system data to a suspicious domain during setup, obfuscated code structure, no documentation or comments explaining intent",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules for system info collection and network requests. It defines a class with a method that, upon installation, gathers hostname, current working directory, fully qualified domain name, IP address, and username. These data are assembled into a dictionary and sent via an HTTP GET request to a potentially malicious domain. The setup function registers this custom class as part of the package installation process, which means this data collection and transmission occurs automatically when the package is installed. The code's structure and naming are intentionally obfuscated, and the data exfiltration behavior during setup is suspicious and indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This package includes malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and exfiltrating it to an external domain during installation. The obfuscation and the timing of data transmission suggest a supply chain attack vector. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered dangerous for deployment.",
