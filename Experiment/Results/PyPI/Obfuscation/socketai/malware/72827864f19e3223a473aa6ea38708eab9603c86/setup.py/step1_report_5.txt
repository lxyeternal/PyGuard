  "purpose": "Customize the setup process to collect system information and send it to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), socket.getfqdn(), socket.gethostbyname(), socket.gethostbyaddr(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to an external URL with collected system information",
  "flows": "Data collected from hostname, cwd, fqdn, ip address, and username flows into the request's parameters, which are then sent to an external server",
  "anomalies": "Unusual function naming (random strings), gathering comprehensive system info, and sending it to a suspicious domain during install process; the URL 'https://cas54n1gfihn6082nil0kz451ubndy6rt.dooracle.in' is potentially malicious or untrusted",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during package installation, gathers extensive system information including hostname, current working directory, fully qualified domain name, IP address, and username. Instead of just performing typical setup tasks, it sends this data to a suspicious external URL via an HTTP GET request, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The use of obfuscated class and method names, along with the external communication during install, indicates an attempt to collect user data covertly or perform malicious activities. The code's intent appears to be tracking or data exfiltration during package installation, which is a common supply chain attack technique.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting detailed system info and transmitting it to a suspicious external server during installation, indicating a potential supply chain attack or malicious backdoor. The obfuscated naming and network activity during setup are clear indicators of malicious intent.",
