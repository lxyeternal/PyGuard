  "purpose": "Custom installation script that gathers system information and sends it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), socket.getfqdn(), socket.gethostbyname(), socket.gethostbyaddr(), getpass.getuser(), requests.get() to a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() sending data to an external URL.",
  "flows": "System information is collected through socket and os modules, stored in a dictionary, then sent via HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Code collects detailed system info and sends it to an external server without user consent. The function name and class name are obfuscated and nonsensical, indicating potential malicious intent. The URL appears suspicious and unrelated to typical package functionality.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install command to perform additional actions during package installation. It collects hostname, current directory, fully qualified domain name, IP address, and username. Immediately after, it sends these details via a GET request to a remote server. The use of obfuscated class and method names suggests an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. The URL contacted is suspicious and unrelated to the package’s stated purpose. No other benign or functional code is present. This pattern indicates potential data exfiltration at install time, which is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears malicious, primarily due to its data collection and exfiltration behavior during installation, coupled with obfuscated naming and suspicious URL. It constitutes a supply chain attack vector by secretly collecting user/system data and transmitting it to an external entity.",
