  "purpose": "To define a custom setup process that gathers system information and sends it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), socket.getfqdn(), socket.gethostbyname(), socket.gethostbyaddr(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call with system information sent to a suspicious domain",
  "flows": "Data collected from system info functions flows into a dictionary, which is then sent via HTTP GET request to a remote server",
  "anomalies": "Code collects detailed system info (hostname, fqdn, IP, username) and sends it to an external server during package installation without user consent, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that extends the standard 'install'. During installation, it gathers hostname, current working directory, fully qualified domain name, IP address, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain, passing the collected info as parameters. This behavior indicates potential data exfiltration during package install, which is unusual for a legitimate setup script. The code does not use standard setup practices for information gathering and transmits data to a domain that appears malicious or untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and sending it to an external server during package installation, which could be used for tracking or further malicious activities. This is a security concern and should be flagged as malicious.",
