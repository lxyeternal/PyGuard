  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, acting as a backdoor to exfiltrate system information during package installation. The obfuscation and contact with a suspicious URL strongly indicate malicious intent, constituting a supply chain attack vector. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior."
