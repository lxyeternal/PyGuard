  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, hardcoded secrets, eval usage, network or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, data exfiltration points, system commands, hardcoded credentials, eval execution.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via variable assignments, eval calls, network functions, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, unsafe eval usage, hardcoded URLs/credentials, suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high suspicion when it contains obfuscation, unsafe eval, hardcoded secrets, and potential backdoors, leading to high malware and security risk scores. Benign code with no suspicious patterns justifies low scores. The consistency of scores with descriptions across reports indicates accurate assessments. Report 4's high scores are justified by the described malicious indicators; benign reports align with low scores.",
  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are consistent with their analyses. Report 4 correctly reflects high malicious potential due to suspicious patterns, while others are justified as benign. No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are accurate and well-founded.",
