  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be any network calls, file operations, or system commands, but none are explicitly shown in the provided code.",
  "flows": "There are no evident source-to-sink data flows; the code primarily consists of function definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code includes typical import statements and function definitions. No network activity, data leakage points, or malicious operations are present. The absence of external data handling, network communication, or obfuscated code suggests a low likelihood of malicious intent. The code structure is simple, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns or hidden malicious intent.",
