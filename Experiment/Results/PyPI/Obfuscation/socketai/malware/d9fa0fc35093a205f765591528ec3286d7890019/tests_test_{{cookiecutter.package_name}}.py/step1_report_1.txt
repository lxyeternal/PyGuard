{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a standard Python script intended for general utility or application logic, with no immediately apparent malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data is not explicitly read from external sources such as files, network, or environment variables; the code uses standard library functions and possibly imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions or data storage points, but none of these indicate untrusted data processing or leakage.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the code mainly performs straightforward computations or operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code reveals standard programming patterns with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no suspicious network calls, credential leaks, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code maintains typical security hygiene, avoiding insecure practices such as unsafe eval, insecure SQL, or hardcoded credentials. The code structure is clear, and no anomalies or obfuscation techniques are observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with low likelihood of being used for harmful purposes.",
