  "conclusion": "The current scores are appropriate; however, Report 3's malware score should be elevated to 0.4 to account for eval/exec and obfuscation patterns. Other reports are correctly scored as benign with low risk. Vigilance is advised when eval/exec or obfuscation are present, but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed in the provided snippets."
