  "purpose": "Analysis of code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network data, import statements, code logic, and potential dynamic execution points such as eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variable access, dynamic code execution, data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Sources like environment variables or user input flow into eval/exec or data processing functions; data may be transmitted over network or stored locally.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, obfuscated variable names, dynamic code patterns, incomplete code snippets, minimal logic, or only import statements.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify the benign nature of incomplete or import-only code, with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 3 notes eval/exec and obfuscation, which justify moderate suspicion. Given the potential misuse of eval/exec, the malware score should be increased from 0.2 to 0.4 to reflect moderate suspicion. Other reports' scores are appropriate, considering the limited context. Confidence levels are reasonable, with some uncertainty due to incomplete snippets. Overall, the assessments align with observed patterns, and scores are consistent with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The current scores are appropriate; however, Report 3's malware score should be elevated to 0.4 to account for eval/exec and obfuscation patterns. Other reports are correctly scored as benign with low risk. Vigilance is advised when eval/exec or obfuscation are present, but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed in the provided snippets.",
