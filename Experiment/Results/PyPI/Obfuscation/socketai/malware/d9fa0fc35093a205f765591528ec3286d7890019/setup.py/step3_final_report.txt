    "Creation of a temp file based on hostname hash as a marker"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code defines a function fun() that gathers system username, hostname, external IP, timestamp, and Python version. It creates a marker file in the temp directory. It then sends this data as JSON to a remote IP address via HTTP POST. The function is called immediately during setup, causing data exfiltration during package installation. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads like backdoors or crypto-mining. The behavior is privacy-invasive and covert, indicating malicious intent. The external IP and URL are suspicious, and the data transmission occurs without user awareness or consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration during package setup, collecting sensitive system info and transmitting it to an external server. This behavior is malicious and privacy-invasive, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation. The activity should be flagged as malicious in supply chain security assessments.",
