  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration during package setup, collecting sensitive system info and transmitting it to an external server. This behavior is malicious and privacy-invasive, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation. The activity should be flagged as malicious in supply chain security assessments."
