      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration during package setup, collecting sensitive system info and transmitting it to an external server. This behavior is malicious and privacy-invasive, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation. The activity should be flagged as malicious in supply chain security assessments."

Other reports are correctly scored as benign with low risk. Vigilance is advised when eval/exec or obfuscation are present, but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed in the provided snippets."
