      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell payload during package setup. The behavior aligns with tactics used in malicious supply chain components. Without decoding the payload, definitive confirmation isn't possible, but the evidence warrants treating this as potentially malicious."
