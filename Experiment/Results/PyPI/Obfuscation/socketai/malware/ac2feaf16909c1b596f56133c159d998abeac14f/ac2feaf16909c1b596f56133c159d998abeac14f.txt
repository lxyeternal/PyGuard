Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware score at 0 and obfuscation scores reflecting suspicion due to the package name. Overall security risk remains low."

While no payloads causing system harm are evident, the behavior aligns with spyware or data theft tools. The malware score should be high, and the security risk is significant, warranting caution and further investigation."
