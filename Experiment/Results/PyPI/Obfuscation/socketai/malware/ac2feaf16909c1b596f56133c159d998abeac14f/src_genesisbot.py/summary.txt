  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily through covert data collection and exfiltration using obfuscated URLs, threading, and message manipulation. While no payloads causing system harm are evident, the behavior aligns with spyware or data theft tools. The malware score should be high, and the security risk is significant, warranting caution and further investigation."
