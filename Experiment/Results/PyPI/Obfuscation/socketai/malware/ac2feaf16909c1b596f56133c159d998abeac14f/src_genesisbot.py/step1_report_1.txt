{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather user information from Discord API, process it, and send it to a remote server; also includes functions for sending data, generating random strings, and handling messages.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from variables such as auth tokens, config files ('assets/config.json'), and message content.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs (via requests.get and requests.post), especially to remote servers with base64 decoded URLs and Discord API endpoints; also sending data with requests.post including user info and possibly message content.",
  "flows": "Source (user tokens, config, message content) -> External HTTP requests (data exfiltration or API interaction) -> Output to remote servers or logs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded URLs that are decoded at runtime, potentially hiding malicious endpoints; fetching and processing sensitive user data from Discord API; sending user info and message content to remote URL; function that generates random string likely for obfuscation or token creation; message manipulation involving random choices; starting a thread that calls a function with user auth info.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves user information from Discord API endpoints, which could be used to gather sensitive data. It decodes base64 URLs, possibly obfuscated malicious endpoints. It sends user data and logs to external servers, which could be for data exfiltration. The code creates threads to run functions asynchronously, including data collection. The random string generator could be used for generating tokens or obfuscation. The function QmqsXbBOLXpxznwjnrwzABSCCKfvkfed modifies message content randomly, which could be malicious if used for message manipulation or injection. Overall, the code exhibits suspicious behaviors like external data exfiltration, use of obfuscated URLs, and gathering user info without explicit user consent, indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates significant malicious activity indicators, including collecting user data from Discord, communicating with potentially malicious external endpoints, and manipulating message content randomly. The use of base64-encoded URLs and threading suggests an attempt to hide and perform covert operations. These behaviors pose security risks and indicate that this package may be malicious or used for malicious purposes.",
