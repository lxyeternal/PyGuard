  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with an obfuscated package name. No malicious behavior is detected, but the naming warrants caution. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware score at 0 and obfuscation scores reflecting suspicion due to the package name. Overall security risk remains low."
