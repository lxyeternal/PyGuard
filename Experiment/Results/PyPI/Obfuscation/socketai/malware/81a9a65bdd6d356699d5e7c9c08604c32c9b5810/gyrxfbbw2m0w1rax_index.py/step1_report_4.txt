  "purpose": "Obfuscated script likely intended to perform malicious actions or conceal malicious intent through dynamic code execution and encoding tricks.",
  "sources": "eval() functions with decoded and encoded strings, base64 decoding, imported modules (base64, codecs), hardcoded encoded strings.",
  "sinks": "eval() with dynamically decoded code, potentially executing obfuscated malicious code, network request URLs, decoding functions, and other dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoded data (from eval) is compiled and executed; encoded strings are decoded and evaluated via eval(); suspicious code is dynamically reconstructed and run, making it hard to analyze static content.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on obfuscated strings, dynamic code reconstruction with eval and base64, inclusion of hexadecimal byte strings, multiple layers of eval(), hidden strings and functions, indirect references to code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules base64 and codecs but primarily uses eval() on obfuscated strings, which are decoded from hex and base64 encoding. The code constructs functions and code snippets dynamically, then executes them via eval() and compile(), which significantly hampers static analysis. The presence of multiple eval() calls with encoded strings suggests an attempt to conceal malicious payloads or behaviors. The URLs embedded within the code point to potentially suspicious endpoints, and the pattern of decoding and executing code indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, possibly to perform remote code execution or data exfiltration. The code does not perform any clear benign actions; it is highly obfuscated to evade detection and analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It uses multiple layers of obfuscation with eval(), base64, and hex-encoded strings to hide its true intent, which appears to be to execute concealed malicious code at runtime. The structure and techniques employed strongly suggest malicious behavior, and it should be flagged as dangerous for use or distribution.",
