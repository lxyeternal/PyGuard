  "purpose": "Obfuscated script likely intended to execute dynamically decoded and encoded code, possibly for malicious or unauthorized activity.",
  "sources": "Data read from base64-encoded strings, eval calls on obfuscated data, eval of dynamically decoded code, use of eval on string representations of code, eval of imported modules.",
  "sinks": "eval calls executing decoded code, potentially malicious code execution, dynamic code evaluation, decoded code potentially performing network operations or system modifications.",
  "flows": "base64 decoded data -> eval -> execution of decoded code; obfuscated string evaluation -> execution; dynamically imported modules and string evaluations -> code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval on obfuscated and encoded strings; dynamic execution of code from base64 strings and eval of string representations; heavily obfuscated code structure; multiple eval and compile calls on data that appears to be intentionally concealed.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with importing modules base64 and codecs, then defines several large strings containing obfuscated, base64-encoded data. It constructs functions or code snippets using eval on string literals representing code, which are then executed via eval after decoding. The presence of eval on base64 strings and string representations of code indicates obfuscation to hide malicious intent. The code's end involves decoding base64-encoded code and executing it dynamically, which is a common technique for executing malicious payloads or payloads that are meant to evade static analysis. The initial part constructs or manipulates strings through eval, while the latter part decodes and executes potentially malicious code, suggesting an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. The obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and decoding strongly point to malicious intent or at least highly suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated, employing dynamic decoding and execution techniques that are typical in malicious scripts aiming to hide their true purpose. It likely executes malicious payloads decoded at runtime, representing a high security risk. The script should be considered dangerous and should not be run in any environment without thorough sandbox analysis.",
