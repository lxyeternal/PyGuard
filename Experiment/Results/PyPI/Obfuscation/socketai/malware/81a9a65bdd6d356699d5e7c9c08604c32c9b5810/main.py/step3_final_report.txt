  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'discordcmd' Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Variables for version and description, package discovery via find_packages(), dependency list in MVaoTIcrHcDVoWyVDQIJEbTDsoVkyALH.",
  "sinks": "No explicit untrusted data sinks; dependencies are declared but contain non-standard package names.",
  "flows": "Data flows from variables to setup parameters; dependencies listed in MVaoTIcrHcDVoWyVDQIJEbTDsoVkyALH.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, non-standard argument names (e.g., 'EziqKxNNWoWehQUXeZfTjAurwyTdsxpZ'), misspelled 'install_requires', suspicious dependency names ('loads', 'urlopen').",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names and a typo in the dependencies argument, which is incorrectly named. The dependencies include non-standard package names, raising suspicion. No malicious code or payloads are present in this snippet. The obfuscation and misconfiguration suggest potential concealment but do not confirm malicious intent. The empty reports provide no additional evidence. The overall risk is low, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script appears standard but contains obfuscation and misconfiguration issues. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the suspicious naming and typos justify a cautious approach. The package should be reviewed further before use.",
