{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the implementation of a Python package, possibly for general utility or application-specific functions. No explicit malicious intent is evident based on the visible code.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, local variables, or imported modules; no external data sources or untrusted input sources are clearly identified.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to return values, file operations, or standard output; no sinks that handle untrusted or sensitive data are explicitly identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks; no suspicious source-to-sink paths or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are detected. No hidden backdoors or malicious logic appear present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to follow standard Python practices without signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The structure and flow are typical of a utility or application module. There are no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling behaviors. Given the lack of any anomalies, malicious activity, or security risks within this fragment, the code seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a normal, benign Python module with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
