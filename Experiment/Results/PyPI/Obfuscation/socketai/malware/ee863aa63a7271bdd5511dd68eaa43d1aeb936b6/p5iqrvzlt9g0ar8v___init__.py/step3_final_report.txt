  "purpose": "Analysis of Python package code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, environment variables, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, dynamic code execution, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input or environment variables flow into eval()/exec() or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation patterns, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, especially in reports indicating eval()/exec() with untrusted data and hardcoded secrets. Benign reports lack suspicious patterns, external data handling, or obfuscation. High malware and risk scores are justified where eval()/exec() and secrets are present. Low scores are appropriate for benign code. The overall assessment aligns with the described behaviors, with the highest concern in report 2 due to dangerous functions and secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that report 2 contains likely malicious code with high obfuscation and security risks, while other reports are benign or suspicious but non-malicious. Scores are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary.",
