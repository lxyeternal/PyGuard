      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to embedded, obfuscated PowerShell payloads executed silently during package setup. The techniques used are typical of malware or backdoors, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The evidence justifies treating this package as malicious until further payload decoding confirms benignity."
