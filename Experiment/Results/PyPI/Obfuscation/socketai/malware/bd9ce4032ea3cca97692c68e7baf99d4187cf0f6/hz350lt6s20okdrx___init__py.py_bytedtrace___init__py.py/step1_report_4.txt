{
  "purpose": "The code gathers system information (username, current working directory, hostname) and sends it to a remote server via an HTTP POST request.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() to 'https://0v0.in/pypi/'",
  "flows": "Sources (user, cwd, hostname) -> Data assembled into JSON -> POST request to remote server",
  "anomalies": "The code immediately posts system information to an external URL without any user consent prompts or validation; URL appears suspicious (non-standard domain '0v0.in'). No other malicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system information such as the username, current working directory, and hostname, then sends this data to an external server. This behavior can be used for tracking or reconnaissance without user consent, especially given the suspicious URL. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads. The activity aligns with data exfiltration or fingerprinting, which could be part of malicious intent depending on context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system info exfiltration to an untrusted, suspicious domain without user awareness. While no malware is directly embedded, this behavior poses privacy and security risks and could be used maliciously for tracking or reconnaissance.",
