  "purpose": "Detects malicious intent through execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during setup.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory triggers subprocess.Popen executing base64-encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess.Popen with obfuscated command, hidden window flags, and silent error handling.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check -> conditional execution -> subprocess.Popen with encoded command.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded, obfuscated PowerShell command, silent exception handling, arbitrary filename, execution during package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup but includes a suspicious block where, if 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess. The command is base64-encoded, likely containing malicious payloads or remote code. The broad try-except blocks suppress errors, potentially hiding failures. The obfuscation and stealthy execution are typical indicators of malicious activity. The scores assigned in reports (malware 0.75-0.8, obfuscated 0.8-0.9, security risk 0.75-0.8) are justified given these indicators. Without decoding the payload, certainty is limited, but suspicion is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup. The scores are appropriate, and the activity warrants treating the package as malicious or highly suspicious pending further decoding of the payload.",
