{
  "purpose": "This script appears to set up a Python package and includes a potentially malicious attempt to run hidden PowerShell commands during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment and filesystem data through os.path.exists and possibly from the subprocess command execution.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes an encoded PowerShell command, which can be used to run arbitrary code or malware silently.",
  "flows": "The script checks for the existence of a directory, then executes a hidden PowerShell command if the directory does not exist, potentially downloading or executing malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command that is hidden and obfuscated; use of subprocess with creationflags to hide window; minimal exception handling that suppresses errors without logging.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a directory check and, if missing, runs an obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen, hiding the window. The encoded command is base64-encoded, likely intended to conceal malicious activity. The setup() call is benign, but the prior code's behavior is suspicious and indicates an attempt at persistence or code injection during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated, hidden execution of a PowerShell command, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent, such as executing payloads silently during package setup. The overall risk is high, as this pattern is commonly used for malware or backdoors in supply chain attacks.",
