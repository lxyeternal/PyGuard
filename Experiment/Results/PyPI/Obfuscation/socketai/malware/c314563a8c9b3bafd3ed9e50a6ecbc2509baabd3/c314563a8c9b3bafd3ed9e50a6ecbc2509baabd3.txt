      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior indicative of malicious activity, notably the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command with stealth tactics during setup. While payload content is unknown, the pattern aligns with supply chain attack techniques. Scores of approximately 0.8 for malware, 0.9 for obfuscation, and 0.9 for security risk are appropriate given the evidence."
