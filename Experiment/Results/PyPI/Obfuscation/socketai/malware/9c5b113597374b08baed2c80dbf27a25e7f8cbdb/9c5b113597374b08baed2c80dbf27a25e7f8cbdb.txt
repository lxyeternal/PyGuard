      "conclusion": "Based on the provided reports and analysis, the dependency shows no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is low, primarily due to network and input handling concerns, but nothing indicates active threats. The scores are justified and consistent with the observed data."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and exhibits classic signs of malicious obfuscation and payload execution. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified based on the observed pattern. The reports correctly identify the malicious intent, and no score adjustments are necessary."
