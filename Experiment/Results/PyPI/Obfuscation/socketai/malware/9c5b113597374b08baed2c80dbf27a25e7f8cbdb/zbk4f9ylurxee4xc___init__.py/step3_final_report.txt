{
  "purpose": "The code is a Python dependency intended for data processing, network communication, or environment interaction, with no explicit malicious intent identified.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, files, user input, and possibly network sockets or subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to network endpoints, files, or console; subprocess calls may execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment/user inputs to processing functions, possibly passing through subprocess or network operations, but no malicious flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code appears standard. Slight concern with untrusted input handling and network usage, but no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign, with standard data and network operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or credential leaks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2-0.3) are consistent with the analysis. The confidence level is high (0.8-0.9), given the lack of suspicious patterns. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. Overall, the dependency seems safe, with minor considerations for untrusted input handling.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided reports and analysis, the dependency shows no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is low, primarily due to network and input handling concerns, but nothing indicates active threats. The scores are justified and consistent with the observed data.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
