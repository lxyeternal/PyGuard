{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, downloads and executes a remote script from a Discord URL.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1061889522541011006/1089965304202928128/ratfinal.py' is fetched via requests.get and saved locally.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded script 'ratfinal.py' is executed using subprocess.check_call, which executes untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves fetching remote code from the URL (source) and immediately executing it (sink) during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically downloads and executes a script from an external source during setup, which is highly unusual and suspicious. The class and method names are obfuscated or nonsensical, indicating potential malicious intent. The URL points to a likely malicious or C2 server hosting a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration that, when run, downloads a Python script from a Discord CDN link and executes it. The URL and the method names are obfuscated, and the code performs network activity and code execution during installation. Such behavior indicates malicious intent, likely to compromise the system once the package is installed. The use of requests to fetch code and immediate execution suggests a supply chain attack or malicious backdoor.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It downloads and executes code from a remote server during package installation, which could lead to remote code execution and system compromise. It exhibits obfuscation and suspicious behavior consistent with malware deployment.",
