{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script that, upon installation, downloads and executes a Python script from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "requests.get() to fetch remote code; reading from URLs and potentially external sources.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'ratfinal.py' and executing it via subprocess.check_call().",
  "flows": "requests.get() -> writing 'ratfinal.py' -> subprocess.check_call() to execute the downloaded script.",
  "anomalies": "Download and immediate execution of remote code within the installation process; code is obfuscated with non-descriptive class and method names.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install command of setuptools to fetch a Python script from a suspicious Discord URL. The script is saved locally as 'ratfinal.py' and then executed directly. The code structure, including obfuscated class and method names, suggests an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The presence of hardcoded URLs and immediate execution of downloaded content is highly suspicious and typical of supply chain attacks or malware delivery mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious in nature. It downloads and executes remote code during package installation, which is a common technique for delivering malware or backdoors. The obfuscation and behavior strongly indicate malicious intent.",
