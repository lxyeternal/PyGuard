{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extend the setuptools install command to download and execute a remote script during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the URL 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1061889522541011006/1089965304202928128/ratfinal.py' using requests.get.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded content is saved to 'ratfinal.py' and then executed via subprocess.check_call, which runs the script with the current Python interpreter.",
  "flows": "Source: requests.get from the URL -> File write to 'ratfinal.py' -> Execution via subprocess.check_call -> Arbitrary code execution",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically downloads and executes a script from a Discord CDN, which is unusual and suspicious. The class name is obfuscated, and the URL appears to point to a potentially malicious payload ('ratfinal.py'). No validation or verification of the downloaded script is performed.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command class that, when invoked, downloads a Python script from a remote URL hosted on Discord. It saves this script locally as 'ratfinal.py' and then executes it immediately. The setup() configuration includes various metadata, some of which seems normal; however, the core behavior of fetching and executing external code at install time is highly suspicious. This pattern is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious package behavior. No input validation or integrity checks are performed on the downloaded script. The obfuscated class name and the use of Discord for hosting malicious payloads are common tactics used by malware to evade detection. The package's intent appears to be to infect systems with remote code, possibly for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote script during installation, which can lead to remote code execution, system compromise, or malware deployment. The usage of Discord as a hosting source and the absence of validation strongly suggest malicious intent.",
