The code dynamically downloads and runs external code without validation. Use of obfuscated class and method names indicates potential concealment.

The custom install class 'WGtONQepjDYfBRgMuHsDGioawGfDcJqe' overrides the 'run' method (albeit obfuscated) to download a script from a Discord URL. It then executes this script immediately. The URL appears to host potentially malicious code ('ratfinal.py' implies Remote Access Trojan). The code does not validate or verify the downloaded script, leading to high risk of executing malicious payloads. The presence of hardcoded email and password further indicates malicious intent or backdoor capabilities. The obfuscation and misleading naming are typical of malware.\")\n  \"conclusion\": \"The script is highly suspicious due to its downloading and execution of remote code from a potentially malicious URL, use of obfuscated code, and hardcoded credentials. It appears to be designed for malicious activity, such as establishing remote access or executing arbitrary code during package installation.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.8,\n  \"malware\": 0.9,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.9\n}",
