{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a remote script from a Discord URL during setup, saves it locally as 'ratfinal.py', and executes it immediately, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1061889522541011006/1089965304202928128/ratfinal.py' during the install process.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'ratfinal.py' via subprocess, leading to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Remote URL (source) -> Save as 'ratfinal.py' (sink) -> Immediate execution via subprocess (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; no validation or integrity check of downloaded code; URL hosted on Discord CDN; filename 'ratfinal.py' implying malicious payload.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, fetches a script from a suspicious Discord URL, writes it locally, and executes it without validation. The obfuscated naming and lack of verification strongly suggest malicious intent. The behavior aligns with known malware tactics such as remote code download and execution, potentially establishing backdoors or RATs. The high malware (0.9), obfuscation (0.8), and security risk (0.9) scores are justified given the severity of executing untrusted remote code during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by downloading and executing external code without validation, with obfuscation to conceal intent. It poses a severe security risk and should be considered malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified.",
