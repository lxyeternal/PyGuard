      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is simple and not inherently malicious but executes an external script without validation, which could be malicious if 'my_script.py' is compromised. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to external dependencies. Scores in the reports are generally consistent; I recommend maintaining a malware score around 0.2, obfuscation around 0.5, and security risk around 0.7 to reflect the potential danger."
