  "purpose": "Execute an external Python script named 'my_script.py' via a system call.",
  "sources": "The os.system call executing 'python my_script.py'.",
  "sinks": "The system call could execute arbitrary code contained in 'my_script.py', which may be malicious if 'my_script.py' is compromised or contains harmful instructions.",
  "flows": "The function sZqNyAsQvLayNtKvpDwRudqXnIrLFQIg() calls os.system with 'python my_script.py', leading to execution of 'my_script.py'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated function name and dynamic system call to run an external script. No input validation or dynamic parameters involved.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that invokes os.system to run 'python my_script.py'. This pattern is common in executing external scripts, but here it could be exploited if 'my_script.py' is malicious or has been tampered with. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no other suspicious behavior or hardcoded credentials. The obfuscation of the function name may suggest an attempt to hide its purpose, but the core action is simply executing an external script, which can be risky if the script is untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary concern is executing an external script, which could be malicious if 'my_script.py' is compromised or malicious. However, the code itself does not contain direct malicious behavior. Its risk depends entirely on the content and integrity of 'my_script.py'.",
