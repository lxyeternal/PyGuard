  "purpose": "Execute an external script named 'my_script.py' using a system call.",
  "sources": "The os.system() call with the string 'python my_script.py'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external script via os.system, which could potentially run malicious code if 'my_script.py' is malicious or replaced.",
  "flows": "Input data (the string 'python my_script.py') flows directly into the system shell command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() to run a specific Python script without validation or sanitization; no indication of input validation or dynamic data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that runs a separate Python script using os.system(). It does not take external input, so no external data influences the command directly. The script name is hardcoded, which limits dynamic behavior, but the use of os.system() to execute another script can be risky if the script path or name is manipulated externally or if the script itself is malicious. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present. The function is called in the main block, indicating straightforward execution.\n\nOverall, the code's primary concern is the execution of an external script, which could be malicious if 'my_script.py' is compromised. The script's origin and integrity are critical; without validation or restrictions, this could pose a security risk.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code executes an external Python script using os.system(), which may be risky if 'my_script.py' is malicious or tampered with. It does not include input validation or security measures. The behavior is straightforward but potentially dangerous if the script's integrity is not assured.",
