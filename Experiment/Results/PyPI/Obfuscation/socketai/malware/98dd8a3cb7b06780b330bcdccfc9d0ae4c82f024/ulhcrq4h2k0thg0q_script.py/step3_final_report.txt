  "purpose": "Execute an external script ('my_script.py') via a system call, potentially to run malicious or benign code.",
  "sources": "The function sZqNyAsQvLayNtKvpDwRudqXnIrLFQIg calls os.system('python my_script.py')",
  "sinks": "os.system executes 'python my_script.py', which can run arbitrary code, leading to potential system compromise if the script is malicious",
  "flows": "Function invocation -> os.system call -> execution of 'python my_script.py'",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; no input validation or sanitization; static external script call; no dynamic parameters",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated function that calls os.system to run 'python my_script.py'. When executed, it runs an external script without validation or sanitization. The primary concern is that if 'my_script.py' is malicious or compromised, this code facilitates malicious activity. The obfuscation of the function name may suggest an intent to hide malicious behavior, but the code itself is straightforward. Scores assigned in the reports reflect low malware likelihood (0.1-0.3), moderate obfuscation (0.4-0.7), and moderate security risk (0.3-0.7). Given the potential for external script maliciousness, the overall security risk should be considered moderate to high. The code itself is not malicious but poses a security concern depending on the external script's integrity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and not inherently malicious but executes an external script without validation, which could be malicious if 'my_script.py' is compromised. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to external dependencies. Scores in the reports are generally consistent; I recommend maintaining a malware score around 0.2, obfuscation around 0.5, and security risk around 0.7 to reflect the potential danger.",
