  "purpose": "Execute an external script named 'my_script.py' when the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "os.system('python my_script.py')",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing an external Python script",
  "flows": "Main execution triggers the function which calls os.system to run 'my_script.py'",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function name, dynamic execution via os.system, no input validation or sanitization, no explicit credentials or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that runs an external Python script using os.system. The function is invoked only when the script is run as the main program. The use of obfuscated naming suggests an attempt to hide intent. The code does not accept user input or data, but it executes an external script, which could be malicious if 'my_script.py' is malicious. The approach of calling os.system to run another script without validation can be risky, especially if the external script's origin is untrusted. No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data are present. The script's purpose appears to be to execute another script, possibly obfuscated to hide malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple but employs obfuscation and executes an external script without validation, which could be malicious depending on the content of 'my_script.py'. The structure suggests potential malicious intent or at least unsafe behavior if the external script is untrusted.",
