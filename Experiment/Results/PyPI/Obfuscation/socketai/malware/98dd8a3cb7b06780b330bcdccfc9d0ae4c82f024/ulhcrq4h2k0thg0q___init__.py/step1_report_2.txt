  "purpose": "Execute an external Python script named 'my_script.py' through a system call.",
  "sources": "The os.system call that executes 'python my_script.py'.",
  "sinks": "The execution of an external script via os.system, which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The function sZqNyAsQvLayNtKvpDwRudqXnIrLFQIg calls os.system, which runs 'python my_script.py' directly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated function name, but otherwise straightforward execution command. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data passed into os.system.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that, when called, executes 'python my_script.py' via os.system. The main block invokes this function. The code itself is simple, with no dynamic input or external data sources. The execution of an external script is a common operation, but it can be dangerous if 'my_script.py' is malicious or tampered with. No other malicious patterns or obfuscation techniques are evident beyond the obscure function name. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or hidden backdoors within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily serves to run an external script 'my_script.py' without any direct user input. While the code itself does not contain malicious logic, its behavior depends on the content of 'my_script.py'. The use of obfuscated function names could be an attempt to hide intent, but in isolation, it does not necessarily indicate malicious behavior. It warrants caution, especially if the source of 'my_script.py' is untrusted.",
