{
  "purpose": "This code defines an obfuscated function that executes an external script 'my_script.py' via os.system, and calls this function when run as main.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only executes a fixed system command.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes 'python my_script.py', which could lead to execution of malicious code if 'my_script.py' is compromised.",
  "flows": "The function call 'sZqNyAsQvLayNtKvpDwRudqXnIrLFQIg()' leads directly to executing the system command, which is a sink for executing external code.",
  "anomalies": "The function name is highly obfuscated, indicating potential concealment of intent; no input validation or sanitization is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple launcher that executes an external script without validation, with obfuscated naming to conceal behavior. It does not contain malware itself but can be exploited if 'my_script.py' is malicious. The obfuscation and external execution pose security risks, with scores reflecting high obfuscation and moderate risk. Malware suspicion remains low, as no malicious code is present within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The script acts as an obfuscated launcher for an external script, which could be malicious if 'my_script.py' is compromised. The code itself is not malicious but warrants caution due to obfuscation and external execution without validation.",
