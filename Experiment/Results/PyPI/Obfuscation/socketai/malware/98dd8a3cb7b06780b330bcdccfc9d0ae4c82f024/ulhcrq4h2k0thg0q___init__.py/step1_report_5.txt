  "flows": "Function sZqNyAsQvLayNtKvpDwRudqXnIrLFQIg() calls os.system() with a script name, leading to execution of 'my_script.py'",
  "anomalies": "The function name is obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide intent; no other suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated function that runs 'python my_script.py' through os.system(), which executes an external script. The script name is hardcoded, and the function is called unconditionally in the main block. Using os.system() to run scripts is potentially risky, especially if the script name or command is influenced by external input; however, here it is a static string. The obfuscation of the function name may indicate an attempt to hide behavior, but the actual command executed is benign in isolation. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands, based solely on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply executes an external script 'my_script.py' via a system call with an obfuscated function name. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident within this isolated code, although using os.system() can be risky if inputs are uncontrolled. The obfuscation may suggest intent to hide, but functionality appears straightforward.",
