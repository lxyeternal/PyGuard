      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The pattern aligns with common malware delivery techniques, warranting a high security risk assessment. The package should be treated as malicious or compromised until further decoding of the payload confirms its purpose."
