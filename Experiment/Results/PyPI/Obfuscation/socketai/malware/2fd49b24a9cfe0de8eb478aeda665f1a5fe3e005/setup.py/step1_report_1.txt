{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup script for a Python package, with custom installation commands that execute certain functions during the install process.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls to execute shell commands and retrieve system information; potentially malicious URLs in curl commands; usage of os.getcwd() and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "curl commands that send data to external IP addresses; os.popen() executing shell commands with dynamic content; data potentially sent to external server.",
  "flows": "Initialization functions call other functions that execute shell commands with URLs containing getFolderName() and system info; these commands are run during installation, sending data externally.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated function names, dynamic URL construction with potentially sensitive system info, use of os.popen() with external network calls, hardcoded IP addresses in curl commands, functions executing shell commands with no clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup modules and defines functions with obfuscated names. The function ONuxmbVTPYAkmxDvYsDZcigakIgbpUwz() collects system info using platform and environment variables, then executes curl commands to send data to an external IP address (3.221.152.203). The functions are invoked during the custom install class's initialization, meaning data is sent during package installation. The code does not perform any benign package setup actions; instead, it attempts to exfiltrate system information to a remote server, indicating malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated function names and dynamic URL construction suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting system information and sending it to a remote server during package installation. The obfuscation and external network activity strongly suggest malicious intent, possibly for reconnaissance or data theft. The package should be considered dangerous.",
