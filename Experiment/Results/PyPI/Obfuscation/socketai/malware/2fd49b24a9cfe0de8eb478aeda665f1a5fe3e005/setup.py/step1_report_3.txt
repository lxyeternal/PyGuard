{
  "purpose": "The code appears to modify the installation process of a Python package, possibly to execute additional actions during installation.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment information using os.popen('whoami'), 'echo $HOME', and makes HTTP requests to external IPs with curl.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external IPs can leak system information; use of os.popen to run system commands and fetch environment info.",
  "flows": "Initialization of installation class triggers functions that gather system info and send it to external server URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obfuscated function names, dynamic command execution with os.popen, and HTTP requests to fixed external IPs, which is suspicious. No input validation is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script redefines standard setup commands to include custom behavior during installation. It collects system info such as username, hostname, and platform details, then sends this data via HTTP requests to a hardcoded external server IP. The obfuscated function names and the use of system commands combined with external communication suggest an intent to collect and transmit potentially sensitive system data without user consent. There is no indication of malicious payloads like file system modification or privilege escalation, but the data exfiltration behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code modifies the package installation process to secretly gather system information and send it to an external server, indicating malicious data exfiltration behavior. The obfuscation and network communication are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
