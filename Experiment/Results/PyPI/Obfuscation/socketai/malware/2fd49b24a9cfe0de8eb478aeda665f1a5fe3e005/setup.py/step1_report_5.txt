{
  "purpose": "The script modifies the install process for a Python package, potentially to execute additional code during installation.",
  "sources": "os.popen calls executing 'whoami' and 'echo $HOME'; curl requests to a suspicious external IP address; function calls that seem to gather system info.",
  "sinks": "curl commands send data to an external server; os.popen executes commands that could leak system information; code dynamically constructs URLs with potentially malicious intent.",
  "flows": "System info (user and home directory) is gathered, then sent via curl to an external IP, indicating data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names; code gathers system information and sends it to a remote server without clear purpose; use of hardcoded IP address; no clear documentation or benign purpose; dynamic URL construction with system data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions with obfuscated names that gather system info ('whoami', 'echo $HOME') and platform details, then send this data to an external IP address via curl commands. It hooks into the setup process, specifically the 'install' command, to execute these functions during package installation. The use of obfuscated names, external data transmission, and gathering sensitive system information without user consent are suspicious. The external IP address (3.221.152.203) and the URL pattern suggest an attempt at data exfiltration. No benign functionality is apparent; these behaviors could serve malicious purposes such as user tracking, information theft, or establishing backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior indicative of potential data exfiltration and covert system information gathering during package installation. The obfuscated names and external network communication to a suspicious IP address strongly suggest malicious intent. It is recommended to treat this package as malicious or compromised, and avoid usage.",
