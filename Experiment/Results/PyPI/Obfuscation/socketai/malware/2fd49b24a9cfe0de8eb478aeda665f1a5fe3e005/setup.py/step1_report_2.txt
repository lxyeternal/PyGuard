{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with some custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, executes shell commands ('whoami', 'echo $HOME'), and performs HTTP requests using 'curl'. It also reads the current working directory.",
  "sinks": "Shell commands execution via os.popen, HTTP requests that could send data to external servers, and use of system information (username, home directory).",
  "flows": "The functions gather system information and potentially send data via curl commands to an external IP address. The custom install class invokes functions during installation, which triggers data collection and transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated function names and variables, usage of 'os.popen' with command injections (curl calls with data), and sending system info and possibly other data to a remote server. The URL endpoints suggest data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as a setup script, which normally should only handle package installation. However, it contains functions that collect system info ('whoami', 'echo $HOME') and send this info via HTTP requests to an external server at 3.221.152.203. The functions are obfuscated with nonsensical names, which raises suspicion. The functions are called during the custom install process, leading to data exfiltration during package installation. The use of 'os.popen' and 'curl' commands indicates attempts to send environment or system info to an external address. No user input is directly read, but the code acts on system data and makes network calls, which is unusual for a typical setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior, notably exfiltration of system info during package installation via obfuscated functions and network calls. This suggests malicious intent to collect and transmit system data without user consent, indicative of a supply chain attack or malicious package behavior.",
