{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information and exfiltrate it to an external server during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Functions executing shell commands ('whoami', 'echo $HOME', 'platform.VanheeBvDTigHuPYXQUbtPuBbOPbHhhT()'), and the curl commands sending data to external IPs during the install process.",
  "sinks": "External network calls via curl, transmitting system info to hardcoded IP addresses during setup.",
  "flows": "Source functions gather system info, which is then sent through curl commands to external IPs during the execution of the custom install class.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names, dynamic URL construction, network activity during package installation, hardcoded external IP, and use of os.popen() for system info collection.",
  "analysis": "The code contains obfuscated functions that gather system info ('whoami', 'echo $HOME', platform info) and send this data via curl to a fixed external IP during package installation. The functions are invoked in the constructor of a custom install class, ensuring exfiltration occurs automatically. The use of hardcoded IP addresses, obfuscated names, and network activity during setup strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at data theft or reconnaissance. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks, and the external communication is suspicious and potentially harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious activity involving data exfiltration during installation, obfuscation to hide intent, and external communication with a suspicious IP. It should be classified as malware with high severity, and usage should be avoided.",
