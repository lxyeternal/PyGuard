{
  "purpose": "The code appears to modify the setup process for a Python package, potentially injecting malicious behavior during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment and system information using os.popen() calls, such as 'whoami' and 'echo $HOME'. It also constructs and executes curl commands to send data to a remote server.",
  "sinks": "The curl commands send data to an external IP address, which could be used for exfiltration of system or user information. The functions that generate these commands are invoked during the custom installation process.",
  "flows": "Sources like 'whoami' and 'echo $HOME' are used to gather system info. The data from these sources is incorporated into curl commands that send this info to a remote server during the install phase, creating a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated function names, use of os.popen() with network calls during setup, and remote data exfiltration patterns are highly suspicious. The code gathers sensitive information and sends it externally without user consent or transparency.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions with obfuscated names that gather system information, including current user and home directory, then send this data to a remote server via curl commands embedded in os.popen(). These functions are invoked during the installation process by overriding the install class, meaning this malicious activity occurs automatically when the package is installed. The code uses obfuscated function and variable names, which is typical in malicious or obfuscated code. The remote IP address and URL suggest potential data exfiltration or command/control activities. The code does not appear to serve any legitimate purpose related to package setup and instead focuses on collecting and transmitting system data surreptitiously.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to an external server during package installation. The obfuscation and network activity are typical indicators of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or backdoor setup. It should be considered malicious and unsafe to use.",
