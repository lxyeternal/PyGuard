  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function, but without seeing the actual code content, it is difficult to determine precisely. It could be anything from data processing to network communication.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from function arguments, environment variables, or external files; specific sources cannot be identified without code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writing, executing system commands, or data storage points, but exact sinks cannot be determined without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flow likely involves input sources passing through processing functions to output sinks, but specifics cannot be identified without the actual code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual control flows can be identified without the code content.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information to perform a detailed step-by-step analysis. No code snippets or specific logic provided to examine for malicious behavior or security issues.",
