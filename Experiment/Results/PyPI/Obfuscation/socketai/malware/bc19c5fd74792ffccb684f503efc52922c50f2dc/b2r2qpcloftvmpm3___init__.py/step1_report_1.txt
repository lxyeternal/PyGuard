  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific computational task, possibly involving data processing or interaction with external systems.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables and possibly from function parameters or external files (if any).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if present; specifically, code that executes external commands, writes to files, or sends data over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions through internal processing functions, potentially reaching sinks such as network or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident. No unusual dynamic execution or misleading variables are detected. The code appears straightforward; however, without full context, some risk remains if external inputs are untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with standard import statements and environment variable access, which are common. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, suspicious network calls, or backdoors are apparent. The logic flows logically with no anomalies or unusual constructs. The absence of dynamic code execution or obfuscated parts reduces suspicion. Since the code is minimal or incomplete, the confidence is limited; further context could be necessary to rule out hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious activities detected. Due to the limited scope, confidence is moderate; no malicious intent is indicated.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
