  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to executing an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup. The pattern aligns with known supply chain attack tactics. The scores assigned are appropriate; the overall security risk is very high. This package should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious pending further payload analysis."
