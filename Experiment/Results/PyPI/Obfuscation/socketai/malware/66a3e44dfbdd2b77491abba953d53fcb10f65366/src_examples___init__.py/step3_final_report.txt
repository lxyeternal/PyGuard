  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code indicators such as obfuscation, dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input points include environment variables, user inputs, hardcoded URLs/IPs, and dynamic imports or eval/exec statements.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration, network communication, file system modifications, or command execution pathways originating from sources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or user input through dynamic code execution or variable manipulation to sinks such as network sockets, file writes, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, dynamic imports, eval/exec usage, hardcoded URLs/IPs, conditional external execution, and convoluted code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical indicators of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are suspicious. Hardcoded network addresses and conditional external calls further increase risk. The suspicion is justified by the presence of obfuscation and potential for malicious payloads. No evidence of benign behavior or safe patterns was identified. The overall behavior suggests a high likelihood of malicious intent, especially if dynamic code execution is confirmed. The code's structure and signals warrant a malware score of 0.6, obfuscation score of 0.8, and security risk score of 0.75, aligning with the suspicion level.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains obfuscated code with dynamic execution and suspicious patterns, indicating a high probability of malicious behavior. While no explicit payload is confirmed, the indicators justify a high security concern. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm malicious intent.",
