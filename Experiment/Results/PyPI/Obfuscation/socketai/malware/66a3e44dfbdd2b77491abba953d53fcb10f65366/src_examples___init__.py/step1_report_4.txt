  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be the implementation of a Python package, potentially for general use or a specific functionality. Without specific functionality shown, it is not possible to determine the exact purpose.",
  "sources": "Input reading points are not explicitly shown; typical sources could include environment variables, user input functions, or external data files if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system calls, but none are explicitly identified in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No clear data flows from sources to sinks are observable in the snippet, as it mainly contains structural or import statements without active data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hard-coded secrets, or obfuscated code are evident. The code structure appears standard with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code reveals standard Python syntax and imports. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors, are present. The code does not include dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious libraries. Due to the lack of active logic in the snippet, no malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious activities or anomalies identified.",
