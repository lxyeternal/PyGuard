{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'multicolored', with custom installation behavior that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from an embedded base64-encoded string within the notmalfunc() function.",
  "sinks": "The decoded base64 string is executed via os.system(), which can run arbitrary system commands.",
  "flows": "The code decodes the base64 string in notmalfunc(), then executes it with os.system() during the install process, leading to remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to conceal code; the execution of decoded code via os.system(); the obfuscated nature of the payload; code does not include any validation or safeguards.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools modules and defines a base64 decoding function. It embeds an obfuscated base64 string that, when decoded, is executed through os.system(). This code is called during the package installation phase, specifically in the AfterInstall class's run() method, which is invoked automatically during setup. The decoded payload appears to be a cURL command that likely fetches additional code or performs a network operation, indicating potential malicious activity. The use of base64 and execution functions suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent, potentially installing or executing remote content without user awareness. The rest of the setup code appears standard and benign, but the embedded payload's behavior is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated and hidden malicious behavior that executes arbitrary system commands during installation. This pattern is typical of malicious supply chain attacks aiming to run remote or harmful code without user consent. It is highly suspicious and should not be trusted for secure use.",
