{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to decode a base64-encoded string and execute it via os.system() during package installation, likely to run a remote command such as fetching malicious content.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in notmalfunc(), which is decoded and executed during the run of AfterInstall.run().",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executing the decoded string, which is a remote fetch command (curl to a URL).",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded in notmalfunc(), then passed directly to os.system() during the AfterInstall run, executing remote code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate a remote fetch command, executed during package installation without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code decodes a base64 string that translates to a remote curl command, then executes it via os.system() during setup. This pattern indicates remote code execution, typical of malicious supply chain attacks. The obfuscation via base64 and execution during install are suspicious. The payload likely fetches and runs malicious content from a remote server, posing high security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior involving remote code fetch and execution during package installation, with obfuscation to conceal intent. It should be classified as malicious, representing a severe security threat.",
