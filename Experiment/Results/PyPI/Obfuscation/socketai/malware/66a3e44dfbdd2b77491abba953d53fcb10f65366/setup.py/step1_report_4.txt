{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, upon installation, executes a function that decodes and runs a Base64-encoded string which performs an HTTP request.",
  "sources": "The function 'notmalfunc' reads an encoded string and executes system commands via 'os.system'. The encoded string is decoded from Base64 and then executed.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' call executes shell commands decoded from the Base64 string, which could potentially run malicious commands or network requests.",
  "flows": "The package installation triggers 'notmalfunc' via 'AfterInstall', decoding and executing the Base64 payload. The payload executes a cURL command to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of Base64-encoded code that is decoded and executed at install time is suspicious. The encoded command likely performs network activity without user consent. The code avoids explicit hardcoded credentials but obfuscates its intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration that includes a function 'notmalfunc' which decodes a Base64 string and runs it using 'os.system'. This string, when decoded, runs a 'curl' command to a suspicious URL. The function is invoked during package installation via the 'AfterInstall' class. The code's structure and obfuscation suggest an intent to execute remote commands or retrieve data during install, which is a common tactic for malicious payloads. There are no other suspicious or malicious behaviors evident outside this obfuscated payload execution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is potentially malicious, as it executes a decoded string that performs network activity during package installation, possibly for data exfiltration or remote control. The obfuscation and execution at install time are red flags.",
