{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that, upon installation, executes hidden code potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string within the notmalfunc() function, which is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The decoded command is run through os.system, which could execute arbitrary system commands.",
  "flows": "The setup process triggers notmalfunc() during the installation phase, leading to execution of decoded code via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "The use of base64 encoding to obscure code execution, combined with the execution of decoded content via os.system, suggests obfuscation and potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and defines functions to decode base64-encoded code. The function notmalfunc() decodes a base64 string and executes it with os.system. The base64 string decodes to a curl command that fetches and executes remote content from a suspicious URL, which could be malicious. The run method of the AfterInstall class calls notmalfunc() during installation, meaning this potentially executes malicious remote code without user awareness. The code employs obfuscation techniques, such as base64 encoding, to hide malicious intent. No other suspicious behaviors or hardcoded secrets are present beyond this. The structure suggests an attempt to run malicious code upon package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated remote code execution triggered during package installation, indicating high malicious potential. It is designed to fetch and execute remote content without user consent, representing a significant security threat.",
