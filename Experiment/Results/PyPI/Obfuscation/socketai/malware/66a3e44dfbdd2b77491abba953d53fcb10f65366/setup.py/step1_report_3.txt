  "purpose": "Define a setup process for a Python package that includes executing obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "Base64 encoded string in the notmalfunc() function, executed via os.system after decoding.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executes decoded code, potentially running malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Base64 string -> b64d() decoding -> os.system() executing decoded string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding followed by execution via os.system indicates obfuscated behavior; the string decodes to a URL and command that fetches or interacts with remote content.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a function b64d() for decoding base64 strings. The function notmalfunc() decodes a base64 string which, when decoded, forms a shell command that appears to fetch and execute code from a remote URL. The notmalfunc() is called during the custom install process in the AfterInstall class, which runs after the package installation. This pattern is suspicious because it executes remotely fetched code during setup, which could be malicious. The code uses obfuscation through base64 encoding and execution via os.system, common tactics to hide malicious intent. No other third-party libraries are used, and the code is straightforward in its structure. Overall, the setup process executes remote code during installation, representing a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script executes obfuscated remote code during installation via a base64-encoded command run through os.system. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent, as it can download and run arbitrary code from a remote source during setup. The obfuscation and remote execution pattern are typical indicators of malicious package behavior.",
