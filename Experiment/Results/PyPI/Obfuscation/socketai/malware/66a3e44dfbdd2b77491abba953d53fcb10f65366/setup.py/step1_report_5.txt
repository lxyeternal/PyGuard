{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that performs installation and development setup, with a function that decodes base64-encoded code and executes it during installation.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string inside the notmalfunc() function, which is decoded and executed during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executing the decoded code, which is potentially running arbitrary commands.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string is decoded via b64d() and then passed to os.system(), executing the decoded shell command during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically during installation, which is unusual and suspicious. The payload appears to be a URL or command string, indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package using setuptools, with custom install and develop commands. The notmalfunc() function decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it via os.system(), which is a common technique for obfuscated or malicious code execution. The encoded payload decodes to a cURL command that fetches content from a suspicious domain and possibly executes it, representing a high risk of malicious activity. The code does not validate or sanitize the decoded content, increasing the risk. The structure and code do not contain obfuscation beyond base64 encoding, and the payload’s purpose is hidden intentionally, raising suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious behavior: during installation, it decodes and executes a base64-encoded command that could fetch and run malicious code from a remote server. This indicates malicious intent, possibly to infect systems during package installation. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered unsafe to use.",
