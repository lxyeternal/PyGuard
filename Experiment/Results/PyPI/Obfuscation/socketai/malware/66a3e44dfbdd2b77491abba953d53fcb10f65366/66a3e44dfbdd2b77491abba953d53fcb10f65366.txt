The recommended malware score for report 4 is increased to 0.8 to better reflect the observed obfuscation and dynamic code usage. The other scores are appropriate. No further adjustments are necessary."

While no explicit payload is confirmed, the indicators justify a high security concern. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
