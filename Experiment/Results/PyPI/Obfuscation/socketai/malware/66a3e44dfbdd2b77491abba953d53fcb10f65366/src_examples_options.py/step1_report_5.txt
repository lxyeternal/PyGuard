  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided or is empty.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, user input, and external modules.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to files, makes network requests, and executes system commands.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables and user input flows through processing functions to network requests, file writing, and system execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are immediately evident. The code uses standard library functions and common third-party modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules and uses environment variables, network requests, and system commands in typical ways. No malicious code patterns such as data exfiltration, unauthorized network communication to suspicious domains, or backdoors are evident. The data flow appears consistent with legitimate operations. No obfuscated code, hidden functions, or suspicious control flows are observed. The code may contain security considerations like insecure environment variable usage or command execution, but nothing explicitly malicious is identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or malware. The code appears to be standard, with normal data handling and system interactions. No security risks surpass typical application vulnerabilities. Confidence is high that the code is benign in its current form.",
