  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit purpose evident from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from standard input (e.g., sys.stdin), environment variables, or file reads if present. Specific source points are not shown in the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Data is outputted via print statements, writing to files, or network connections (e.g., socket or requests library). These are typical sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from sources may flow into functions that process or send data, such as HTTP requests or file writes. Exact flow paths are not fully detailed without complete code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code or unusual language features, and no suspicious network connections are evident in the provided code fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code seems to follow standard patterns for input handling, data processing, and output. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are visible. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical. The absence of any obfuscated or hidden code suggests low suspicion. However, due to the limited snippet, some potential hidden behaviors cannot be ruled out without more context.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to be a normal data processing script with no indications of supply chain sabotage or security issues.",
