  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that reports 1, 2, 3, and 5 are benign with low risk, while report 4 shows suspicious patterns warranting a higher malware score. The recommended malware score for report 4 is increased to 0.8 to better reflect the observed obfuscation and dynamic code usage. The other scores are appropriate. No further adjustments are necessary."
