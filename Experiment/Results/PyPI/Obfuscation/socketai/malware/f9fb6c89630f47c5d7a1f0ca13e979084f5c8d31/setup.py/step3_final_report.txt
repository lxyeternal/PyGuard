{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform malicious data exfiltration during package setup and exit, collecting system info, encoding it, and sending it to a suspicious external domain, while obfuscating its behavior.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org', reading 'README.md', os.uname() for hostname, and writing 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests to 'https://kotko.org' with encoded system info, writing to 'pocbykotko.txt', and executing network requests during setup and at exit.",
  "flows": "Code reads system info and external IP, encodes data in base64, then transmits it via GET request to external domain during setup and at program exit; also writes proof file during exit.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, network requests during package installation and exit, writing proof files, and data encoding and transmission to suspicious domains.",
  "analysis": "The code performs external network requests to fetch IP and send data, writes a proof file, encodes system info in base64, and transmits it to a suspicious domain during setup and exit. Variable names are heavily obfuscated, indicating an intent to hide malicious activity. The use of 'atexit' to trigger data exfiltration at program termination further suggests malicious intent. These behaviors are typical of malware designed for covert data collection and exfiltration without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including data exfiltration, obfuscation, and suspicious external communication. The activities during setup and exit strongly indicate malicious intent, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
