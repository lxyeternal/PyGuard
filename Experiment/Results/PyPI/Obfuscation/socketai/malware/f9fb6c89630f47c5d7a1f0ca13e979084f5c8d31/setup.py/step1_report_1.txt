{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package using setuptools, including custom installation behavior and a function triggered at exit, potentially for malicious data collection or exfiltration.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local 'README.md' file; fetches the public IP address via 'https://api.ipify.org'; gathers system information through 'os.uname()'; constructs and encodes data; makes HTTP GET requests to external domains ('https://kotko.org').",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests to external domains with encoded data; writing to a file ('pocbykotko.txt'); possibly sending system info and IP data via requests; executing code at exit (e.g., data exfiltration).",
  "flows": "The system info and IP address are collected, encoded, and sent to external servers; a file is written locally; requests are sent with data that could be used for tracking or malicious purposes.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic system info collection, data encoding, and external HTTP requests at package installation and exit time. The use of encoded data and requests to suspicious domains ('kotko.org') indicate potential malicious intent. The 'atexit' registration and request pattern suggest possible data exfiltration. No legitimate setup function justifies such behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing various modules, some used for system info, HTTP requests, and encoding. It registers a function to run at program exit, which collects system and network data, encodes it, and sends it to a suspicious domain. During setup, it also fetches the public IP address, writes to a file, and makes external requests. The obfuscated variable names and obfuscated data handling hint at malicious intent. The external communication to 'kotko.org' with encoded data strongly indicates data exfiltration. No benign setup or configuration activities justify these network activities, which are characteristic of malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated variables, collects system and network data, and transmits this data to a suspicious domain during package installation and exit, indicative of malicious behavior. It appears to be designed for unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, representing a security risk.",
