{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package, but it includes code that executes network requests and writes to files, potentially with malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Network requests via requests.get(), reading the __file__ path, reading system info with os.uname(), and fetching external IP address.",
  "sinks": "Writing to a file 'pocbykotko.txt', sending data via HTTP GET request to 'https://kotko.org' with encoded system info and IP address.",
  "flows": "The code collects external IP and system info, encodes and sends it to an external server, and writes a proof text file upon installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code makes unsolicited external network requests during package installation, writes a proof file, and encodes system info into a base64 string before exfiltration. Variable names are obfuscated, and code structure is complex without clear documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is an installer script that registers a function to run at exit, which collects system data and sends it to an external server, potentially exfiltrating sensitive info. It writes a proof message to a text file, which might be a marker or proof of compromise. The use of obfuscated variable names and network activity during setup suggests malicious intent. No user input is processed, but the network activity and file writing are suspicious behaviors. The code leverages 'atexit' to ensure data collection and exfiltration occurs at the end of the installation process.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior, primarily data exfiltration of system and network info during package installation. It shows signs of sabotage by secretly transmitting data to an external domain, with obfuscated variables and unexplained external requests. The overall security risk is high, and this package should be considered malicious or compromised.",
