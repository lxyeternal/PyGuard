{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package using setuptools, with additional custom installation behavior that includes network requests and file operations.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org', reading the script's directory, reading README.md, and writing to 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Network requests sending data to external domains, writing to local file 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "flows": "The code makes an HTTP GET request to retrieve the public IP, gathers system info, encodes this data, and sends it to an external server via GET request; it also writes a proof string to a local file during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration by collecting system and network information and sending it to an external domain without clear user consent. The function RiKYBbRvcbNMVacHQXIFWUgNeOqakfeK is registered to run at exit, executing network requests and writing files, which is unusual for standard package setup scripts. The variable and class names are obfuscated, indicating potential intent to hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing modules and defining paths. It defines a custom install class that registers a cleanup function to run at program exit. This function creates a file 'pocbykotko.txt' and writes a proof string, then performs a network request to obtain the system's public IP address. It gathers system hostname info, encodes combined data (IP, hostname, path) in base64, and sends this encoded data via a GET request to an external domain 'kotko.org'. The code's obfuscated variable names and the behavior of collecting and transmitting system information upon installation strongly suggest malicious intent, specifically data exfiltration without user consent. The network communication occurs during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious behavior. The package setup includes standard configuration, but the embedded code performing network operations and writing to a file indicates malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, notably data collection and exfiltration during package installation. It appears designed to stealthily gather system info and send it to an external server, which is indicative of malicious intent. The obfuscation and network activity at install time are warning signs. Overall, this package exhibits high malicious behavior risk.",
