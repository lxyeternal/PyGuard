{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package using setuptools, with custom installation behavior that involves network communication and file writing.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include network requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org', as well as reading the current directory path and reading 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "Sinks include writing to a local file ('pocbykotko.txt'), sending data via an HTTP GET request with encoded parameters, and reading external files ('README.md').",
  "flows": "The code fetches the public IP, encodes and sends this data along with system info to a remote URL during the installation process, which constitutes a source-to-sink flow. File write occurs in the 'atexit' registered function, triggered upon script termination.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes network activity during package setup, writing a proof message to a file named 'pocbykotko.txt', and sending system info and encoded data to an external domain ('kotko.org') without clear justification. The code structure is complex and obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names, and network requests are embedded directly in setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools but introduces a custom install class that registers a function 'RiKYBbRvcbNMVacHQXIFWUgNeOqakfeK' to run at exit. This function writes a proof string to a file and performs network requests to retrieve the system's external IP address, system hostname, and current directory path. It encodes these details and sends them as a parameter in a GET request to an external domain. The presence of hardcoded file names and network communication during setup indicates suspicious activity. The code does not perform any benign or necessary setup tasks that justify such network activity, which could be indicative of data exfiltration or malicious monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to an external domain during the package installation process. The obfuscated variable names and network activity during setup are signs of potential malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, given the unprompted data exfiltration and file writing actions triggered at exit.",
