{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup script for a Python package with additional behaviors during installation and development, including network requests and file operations.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org', reading the script's directory, and writing to a file 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Network requests send data to external servers; writing to 'pocbykotko.txt'; base64 encoding data and sending it via a URL.",
  "flows": "The script gathers external IP and environment info, encodes it, and transmits it to a remote server during the installation process.",
  "anomalies": "Code collects system and network data during package installation, writes to a file, and sends data to external servers without clear legitimate purpose. The variable and class names are obfuscated, which is suspicious. The 'RiKYBbRvcbNMVacHQXIFWUgNeOqakfeK' function is registered to run at exit and performs network requests and file operations, which is unusual for a setup script. The code also contains multiple hardcoded strings and obfuscated variable names, indicating potential intent to hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and performs typical setup configurations, but includes obfuscated variable names and a class that registers an exit function. This function creates a file 'pocbykotko.txt' and writes a proof message, then performs network requests to obtain the external IP address and send encoded data to 'kotko.org'. The data sent includes system hostname, IP address, and the script's directory path, all encoded and transmitted without user consent or clear necessity. The obfuscation and network activity during package setup are suspicious and indicative of potential data exfiltration or malicious tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior through obfuscation, network communication, and data collection during package installation. These activities suggest malicious intent, such as tracking or data exfiltration, making this package potentially harmful. The obfuscation and the data exfiltration steps warrant high security concern.",
