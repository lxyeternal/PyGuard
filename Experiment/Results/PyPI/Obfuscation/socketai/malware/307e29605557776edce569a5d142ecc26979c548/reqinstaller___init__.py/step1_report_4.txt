  "purpose": "Download and execute a remote executable file",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1109115014054416495/1109465188433936425/Windows.exe' is fetched via requests.get()",
  "sinks": "The temporary file created and executed via subprocess.call() can lead to malicious code execution",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves the remote executable -> writes to temporary file -> subprocess.call() executes the file",
  "anomalies": "Direct download and execution of an executable from a remote URL without validation or verification",
  "analysis": "The code downloads an executable from a specified Discord CDN URL, saves it to a temporary file, and then executes it. There is no validation, signature check, or sanitization. The immediate execution of the downloaded file strongly indicates malicious intent, as this pattern is typical for malware delivery. No obfuscated code or suspicious variable names are present, but the behavior itself is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and potentially malicious as it automatically downloads and executes an external executable without verification, which is a common malware delivery method. It should be treated with high caution.",
