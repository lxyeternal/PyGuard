  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from a Discord CDN and directly executes it without validation or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches an executable file from a remote URL using requests, saves it temporarily on disk, and then executes it immediately without any checks or validation. The URL points to a Discord CDN, which is a common vector for hosting malicious payloads. The lack of validation, signature check, or user confirmation indicates potential malicious intent, especially considering the automatic execution of downloaded content. The code structure is straightforward but indicates an intent to run arbitrary code fetched from the internet, which poses high security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This script downloads an executable from a remote source and executes it directly, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The absence of validation or user interaction confirms malicious behavior or intent.",
