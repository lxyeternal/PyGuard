  "purpose": "Evaluation of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on dynamic code execution, suspicious patterns, and potential sabotage.",
  "sources": "Any code reading input, environment variables, network connections, or dynamic execution points such as eval/exec calls.",
  "sinks": "Data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or system commands that could be exploited or malicious.",
  "flows": "Sources leading to sinks via data processing, dynamic code execution, or network communication pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec, suspicious imports, complex or obscure code constructs without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The reports generally recognize signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution in Report 1, with moderate suspicion. Other reports indicate benign or minimal activity, with low confidence in malicious intent. Scores are mostly aligned with the described behaviors, though the malware score in Report 1 could be slightly lowered to reflect the absence of confirmed malicious payloads. Obfuscation scores are appropriate based on the described complexity. Overall, the assessments are consistent, with minor adjustments recommended for accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are largely justified by their analyses. Report 1's moderate suspicion warrants a malware score of 0.3 rather than 0.4, given no confirmed malicious activity. Other reports correctly reflect benign or low-risk code. The overall security posture appears low to moderate, with no definitive malicious payloads detected.",
