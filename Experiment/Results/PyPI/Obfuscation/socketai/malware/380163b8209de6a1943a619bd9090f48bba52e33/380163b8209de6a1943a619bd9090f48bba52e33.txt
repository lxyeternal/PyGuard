      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly collecting and transmitting system information during package installation, functioning as a backdoor. The obfuscation, hardcoded IP, and immediate execution during setup confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the package should be flagged and removed from repositories."
