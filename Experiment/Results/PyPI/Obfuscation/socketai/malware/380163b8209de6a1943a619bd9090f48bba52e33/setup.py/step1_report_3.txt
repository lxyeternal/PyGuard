{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package and includes a potential backdoor function that gathers system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; executing system commands via os.popen; defining the function 'ocYJgYDKpeFONkUmxYIgNnQbvCmoujbt' which collects system info and makes a network request.",
  "sinks": "os.system call to execute 'curl' with a constructed URL containing base64-encoded system info, which sends data to a remote server.",
  "flows": "The function 'ocYJgYDKpeFONkUmxYIgNnQbvCmoujbt' gathers system info, encodes it, then uses 'os.system' to make an HTTP request to 'http:/81.70.191.194:14333/start/' with the data as a URL parameter.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded URL pointing to an external IP, the collection and encoding of system info, and immediate invocation of the function during setup. The code uses base64 encoding differently depending on Python version, which may be obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities and other modules, then reads a README file. On MacOS systems, it defines a function that gathers system information such as 'uname', 'id', 'pwd', and 'ifconfig' output. It encodes this data in base64, then makes an HTTP GET request to an external IP address with this data appended in the URL. The function is called immediately during the setup process, suggesting it runs when the package is installed or imported. The URL and data collection behavior indicate an attempt to exfiltrate system details to a remote server. While the core setup is legitimate, the embedded function acts as a hidden backdoor, potentially malicious, collecting and transmitting sensitive info without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a concealed data exfiltration mechanism that gathers system info on MacOS systems and sends it to an external server during package setup. This behavior is malicious and constitutes a backdoor. The presence of immediate execution during setup and the hardcoded external URL strongly indicates malicious intent.",
