{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it also contains hidden malicious behavior that exfiltrates system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md', collecting system info via os.popen calls ('uname -a', 'id', 'pwd', 'ifconfig'), and reading 'long_description_content_type' (though not a typical source of untrusted data).",
  "sinks": "The os.system call that executes a curl command to send encoded system information to an external IP address: 'http:/81.70.191.194:14333/start/' + encoded data.",
  "flows": "System info gathered via os.popen calls is JSON-encoded, base64-encoded, then appended to the URL and sent via curl command, representing a clear data exfiltration flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a function that collects system data and exfiltrates it over the network in a non-standard setup script. The code is embedded within a package setup file, which is unusual and suspicious. The code also redundantly imports setup and Extension modules multiple times. The IP address used is suspicious and hardcoded, and the base64-encoded JSON includes potentially sensitive system info.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with standard setup imports but then contains a hidden function (ocYJgYDKpeFONkUmxYIgNnQbvCmoujbt) that executes only on macOS ('darwin') systems. This function collects system details ('uname', 'id', 'pwd', 'ifconfig') via os.popen calls, encodes the information in JSON, then base64, and sends it via a curl command to an external IP address. This behavior is hidden within a typical setup.py, indicating an attempt to exfiltrate data covertly. The code does not have any legitimate purpose related to package setup or distribution; instead, it stealthily leaks sensitive system info, which is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, specifically hidden data exfiltration of system information to a remote server, embedded within a package setup script. It appears to be designed for malicious surveillance or data theft, disguised as a normal setup procedure.",
