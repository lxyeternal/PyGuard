{
  "purpose": "The code clandestinely collects system information on macOS and exfiltrates it to an external IP address during package setup, indicating malicious backdoor behavior.",
  "sources": "Execution of system commands ('uname -a', 'id', 'pwd', 'ifconfig') via os.popen; reading sys.version; reading README.md file.",
  "sinks": "Network request sent via os.system calling curl to external IP with encoded system info.",
  "flows": "System commands -> JSON serialization -> base64 encoding -> URL construction -> os.system call to send data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; hardcoded external IP; immediate execution during setup; use of deprecated modules ('imp'); redundant imports; covert data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code runs a function only on macOS that gathers sensitive system info using system commands, encodes it, and transmits it to an external IP address via a curl request embedded in os.system. The function is invoked during setup, indicating active covert data exfiltration. Variable names are obfuscated, and the URL is hardcoded, which are typical signs of malicious intent. The behavior aligns with known malicious backdoors or info-stealing malware. The use of base64 encoding and obfuscated identifiers further supports malicious activity. The code's purpose is to surreptitiously harvest system data and send it to an attacker-controlled server, constituting a high-severity security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly collecting and transmitting system information during package installation, functioning as a backdoor. The obfuscation, hardcoded IP, and immediate execution during setup confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the package should be flagged and removed from repositories.",
