{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup configuration and execute a hidden PowerShell command to perform potentially malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Reading the existence of the file 'tahg' from the filesystem; executing a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen",
  "sinks": "Executing a PowerShell command that appears to be encoded, potentially for malicious purposes",
  "flows": "Check if 'tahg' exists -> if not, run encoded PowerShell command via subprocess, potentially to download or execute malicious code",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command with hidden window; no explanation for the command's purpose; absence of comments; broad try-except blocks hiding errors; the PowerShell command is encoded, which is often used to obfuscate malicious activities",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to check for the existence of a specific file ('tahg'). If the file does not exist, it executes a PowerShell command with hidden window and encoded content, which is a common obfuscation technique. The command is base64-encoded, making it difficult to immediately interpret, but encoded PowerShell commands are frequently used in malicious activities such as downloading or executing payloads, exfiltrating data, or establishing backdoors. The setup function is standard for packaging but appears to be used here to mask malicious behavior under the guise of a legitimate setup script. The use of broad try-except blocks further conceals errors or detection attempts.",
  "conclusion": "The script combines benign-looking setup code with obfuscated PowerShell execution that likely aims to run malicious payloads silently. The intent appears to be malicious, leveraging obfuscation and hidden execution to evade detection.",
