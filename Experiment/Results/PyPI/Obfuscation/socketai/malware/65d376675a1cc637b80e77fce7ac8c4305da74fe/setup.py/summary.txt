  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily through the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The pattern aligns with common malware delivery tactics. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and error suppression justify high malware and security risk scores. Further decoding of the payload is recommended before deploying or distributing this package."
