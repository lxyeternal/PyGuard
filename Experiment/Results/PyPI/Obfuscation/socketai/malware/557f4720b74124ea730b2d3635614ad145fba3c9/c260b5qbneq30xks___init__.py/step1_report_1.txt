  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility module that performs some form of data processing or configuration handling, but without specific context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, input parameters, and possibly files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, outputs, network connections, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through processing functions to sinks like output functions or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or backdoors observed. The code uses dynamic features but nothing inherently malicious is evident from static analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, employing standard libraries and practices. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious data handling patterns detected. It avoids insecure functions, and no hardcoded secrets are visible. Without runtime context or external dependencies, no malicious behavior is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears benign with no signs of malicious intent. It follows normal coding practices and does not exhibit malicious patterns or security risks based on static review.",
