  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; Report 4 exhibits moderate suspicion due to potential data leakage and obfuscation, but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. The scores are generally appropriate, with a slight recommendation to lower malware suspicion in Report 4 if further evidence does not emerge."
