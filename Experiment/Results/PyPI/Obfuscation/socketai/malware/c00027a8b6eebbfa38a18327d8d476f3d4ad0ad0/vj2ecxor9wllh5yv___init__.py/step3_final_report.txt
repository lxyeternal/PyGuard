  "purpose": "The code's purpose appears to be data processing or communication, with no suspicious activity indicated.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, or data received from external sources.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, or system commands where untrusted data could cause effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/env) to sinks (network/file/system), but no malicious flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. No suspicious data flows or hardcoded secrets are present. The absence of code limits the analysis, but the provided descriptions suggest benign intent. Scores are consistent with the evidence, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and low security risk scores justified by the lack of suspicious activity. Confidence is moderate due to limited context but aligns with the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is low, and the scores are appropriate given the available information.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
