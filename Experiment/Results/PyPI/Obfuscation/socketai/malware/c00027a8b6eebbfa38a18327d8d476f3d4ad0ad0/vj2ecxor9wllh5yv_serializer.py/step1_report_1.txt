{
  "purpose": "The code transforms Django model instances into dictionaries, optionally including extended info serialized via protobuf, and processes collections of such models.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from Django model instances and protobuf serializations.",
  "sinks": "The data is returned as dictionaries, with no evident direct data sinks such as network or file I/O, but these could be potential sinks depending on downstream usage.",
  "flows": "Input model instances are converted to dictionaries; if 'with_extinfo' is true, additional protobuf data is included; the resulting dictionaries are returned or assembled into lists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or unusual behaviors are observed. The code uses obfuscated variable names but that alone isn't malicious.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform data serialization from Django models and protobufs into dictionaries. The code appears to be straightforward data transformation without any network activity, system modification, or hidden behaviors. Variable names are obfuscated, but logic remains standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection. The use of helper functions for serialization and optional inclusion of extended info is typical. No suspicious code patterns or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data serialization routine with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It converts model instances into dictionaries, optionally including protobuf-serialized extended info, which is a common pattern in web applications. No malicious behavior or malware indicators are detected.",
