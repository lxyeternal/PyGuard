  "purpose": "The code converts Django model instances to dictionaries, optionally including protobuf extended info, and processes querysets to produce lists of such dictionaries.",
  "sources": "model_to_dict, qvBioWYyqIrBeOvEXhYzYpZUzQAUAWBa.ext_info_proto()",
  "sinks": "Returning dictionaries, possible use of protobuf data",
  "flows": "model_to_dict reads the model data; qvBioWYyqIrBeOvEXhYzYpZUzQAUAWBa.ext_info_proto() provides additional data; data is aggregated into dictionaries and returned",
  "anomalies": "The code uses highly obfuscated variable and function names, which may be a tactic to hide malicious intent. There are no direct network or file operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions: one converting a single model to a dictionary, optionally including protobuf info, and the other processing a queryset into a list of such dictionaries. The use of obfuscated names suggests attempts to conceal purpose, but the operations themselves are standard data serialization steps typical in Django applications. No evident malicious payloads, network activity, or system manipulation are present. The code seems intended for data processing and serialization, which is common in APIs or logging features.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform typical model serialization with optional protobuf extension inclusion. Despite obfuscated identifiers, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is likely a benign utility function within a larger system.",
