  "purpose": "The code converts Django model instances to dictionaries, optionally including extended info from a protobuf attribute.",
  "sources": "model_to_dict on model instance; qvBioWYyqIrBeOvEXhYzYpZUzQAUAWBa.ext_info_proto() if with_extinfo is True",
  "sinks": "The code does not include data sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or database operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model_to_dict and pb_to_dict into a dictionary, optionally including serialized protobuf data, then returns or processes lists of such dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated, but there are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily involves serializing model data into dictionaries, with optional protobuf data inclusion. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data sinks that could leak or manipulate data, and no signs of obfuscated or malicious logic. The function names and variable names are intentionally obscure, but the operations themselves are straightforward data serialization. No malware behavior or security vulnerabilities are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard serialization tasks with no signs of malicious behavior, no sensitive data leakage, and no security risks identified. It appears to be utility functions for data transformation within a safe context.",
