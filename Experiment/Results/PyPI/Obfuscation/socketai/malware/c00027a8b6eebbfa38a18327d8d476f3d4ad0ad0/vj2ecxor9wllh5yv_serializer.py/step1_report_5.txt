  "purpose": "The code converts Django model instances to dictionaries, optionally including extended information from protobuf objects.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'qvBioWYyqIrBeOvEXhYzYpZUzQAUAWBa' (model instance), 'qset' (queryset or list of models). Data is read from model instances and protobuf methods.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from functions; no data is sent externally, no network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model instance input to dictionary output, optionally including protobuf converted data; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which is often a sign of intentionally hidden or malicious code. Use of multiple import aliases and dynamic-like functions may hide intent.",
  "analysis": "The functions convert Django models to dictionaries using 'model_to_dict' and 'pb_to_dict', and conditionally include protobuf data. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, which could be intended to hide malicious intent or complexity. There are no evident network, file, or environment interactions, and no use of untrusted input data from outside the function scope. The code appears to be standard data serialization, with no clear malicious behavior. The obfuscation level suggests low confidence in benign intent, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate data serialization functions with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues within this code segment.",
