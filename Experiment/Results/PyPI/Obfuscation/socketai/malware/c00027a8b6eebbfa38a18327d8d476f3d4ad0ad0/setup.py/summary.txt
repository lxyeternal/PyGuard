  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation, indirect code execution, and import of a suspicious module during installation, which are strong indicators of malicious or backdoor behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, reflecting high suspicion and security risk. This package should be treated as potentially malicious until further analysis confirms its safety."
