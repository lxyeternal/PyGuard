  "purpose": "To customize the installation process of a Python package, potentially executing additional code during installation.",
  "sources": "Execution of subprocess.Popen with inline Python code that imports 'secrevtwo' and 'dist_util'.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing Python code with import statements, potentially executing arbitrary code during install.",
  "flows": "Setup script runs install command -> Custom install class calls subprocess with Python code -> Imports 'secrevtwo' and 'dist_util'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names, indirect subprocess calls with inline Python code, importing 'secrevtwo' during install, which may be a secret or malicious module.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class with obfuscated naming. During installation, it attempts to run Python code in a subprocess, importing 'secrevtwo' and 'dist_util'. The repeated fallback attempts and obfuscated code suggest an attempt to conceal behavior. Importing 'secrevtwo' during installation, especially when dynamically executed, can be a vector for malicious actions such as secret data collection or backdoor activation. No explicit malicious activity like network calls or file manipulation is evident, but the indirect code execution and obfuscated style are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to intentionally execute hidden Python code during package installation, importing a module named 'secrevtwo', which raises suspicion of malicious behavior. The obfuscation and dynamic execution methods suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent or sensitive operations during installation.",
