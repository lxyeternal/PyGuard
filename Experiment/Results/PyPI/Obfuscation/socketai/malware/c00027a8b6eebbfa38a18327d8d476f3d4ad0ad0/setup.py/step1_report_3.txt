  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to execute code that imports a module named 'secrevtwo', potentially for setup or initialization purposes.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.Popen calls executing inline Python code that imports 'secrevtwo' and 'dist_util'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess with potentially malicious code execution or unintended side effects during installation.",
  "flows": "The setup script runs a subprocess that imports 'secrevtwo' during installation, which could be used to perform actions outside normal installation scope.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, indirect subprocess calls to import 'secrevtwo', use of try-except without handling, and importing 'dist_util' in a subprocess. The code appears intentionally obscure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of the 'install' command that, upon installation, runs a subprocess to import 'secrevtwo' and 'dist_util'. The method names and class names are obfuscated, which is suspicious. The subprocess calls execute inline Python code that imports 'secrevtwo', which could be malicious if 'secrevtwo' is malicious or if the import triggers malicious behavior. The try-except blocks suppress errors without any logging or fallback, which could hide malicious activities or failures. The setup installs the 'secrevtwo' package as a dependency, and the import during installation could be used to execute malicious code at install time, possibly without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The script employs obfuscation and executes code during installation that imports 'secrevtwo', suggesting potential malicious intent or hidden behavior. This behavior warrants suspicion, as it could be used to execute arbitrary code or compromise the environment during installation.",
