{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for encrypting and decrypting data using AES CBC mode with base64 encoding, likely for secure data transmission or storage.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'key' and 'raw' for encryption; encrypted data input for decryption.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted output (base64-encoded), decrypted plaintext returned; no external network or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "Raw data is padded and encrypted with a key; encrypted data is decoded, separated into IV and ciphertext, then decrypted to recover the original plaintext.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic IVs per encryption; padding scheme based on block size; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious external calls; code appears to implement standard AES CBC encryption/decryption. No hidden or obfuscated code features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements AES encryption and decryption in CBC mode with PKCS7-like padding, using base64 for encoding. Random IVs are generated for each encryption, enhancing security. The functions appear straightforward and adhere to common cryptographic patterns. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code is clean and uses standard libraries. No obfuscation or malicious anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard encryption/decryption routines securely, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a secure data handling mechanism rather than malicious malware or sabotage.",
