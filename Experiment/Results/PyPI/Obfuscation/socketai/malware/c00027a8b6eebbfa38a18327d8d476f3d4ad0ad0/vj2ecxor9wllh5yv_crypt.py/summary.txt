  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of AES CBC encryption/decryption with proper practices. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. Obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0."
