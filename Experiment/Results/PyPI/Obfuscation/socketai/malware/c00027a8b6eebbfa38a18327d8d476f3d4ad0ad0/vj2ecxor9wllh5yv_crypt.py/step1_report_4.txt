{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for AES encryption and decryption using CBC mode with random IVs, encoding, and decoding data with base64. It appears to facilitate secure data transformation, likely for cryptographic purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'raw' parameter for encryption and the 'iajVlhzWqbqSBWVPUHtHIffdKTMQjgRD' parameter for decryption, both passed into the respective functions.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'nuSdTDTmdeKWMMLgxVojrkroAwFBbyVO' is base64-encoded encrypted data, potentially to be transmitted or stored. The decryption function returns plaintext data after decryption and padding removal.",
  "flows": "Plaintext input -> padding -> encryption with random IV -> concatenate IV + ciphertext -> base64 encode -> output; For decryption: base64 decode -> extract IV -> decrypt -> remove padding -> output plaintext.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a function 'common.crypt' imported but not utilized; the padding scheme manually appends PKCS#7 style padding; random IV generation is standard. No suspicious or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cryptographic routines: PKCS#7 padding, CBC mode AES encryption, and base64 encoding/decoding. It relies on external 'Crypto' library and 'common.crypt' which isn't used here. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The functions serve typical cryptographic purposes without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of AES-CBC encryption and decryption with proper IV handling and padding. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The code's purpose seems to be secure data encryption/decryption, with no indicators of malware or malicious intent.",
