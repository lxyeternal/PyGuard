{
  "purpose": "Provides AES CBC encryption and decryption functions with PKCS#7 padding, using randomly generated IVs for each operation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data (raw plaintext or base64-encoded ciphertext), generates IVs with Random.new().read(), and receives cryptographic keys as parameters.",
  "sinks": "Outputs base64-encoded encrypted data or decrypted plaintext; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input data is padded and encrypted with a new random IV; IV is prepended to ciphertext; during decryption, IV is extracted from the input, and data is decrypted and unpadded.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated, but no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The import 'common.crypt' is unused but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cryptographic routines for AES CBC mode with proper IV management and PKCS#7 padding. IVs are generated securely with cryptographically strong randomness. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or backdoors are detected. Obfuscation appears superficial, aimed at variable name concealment, not malicious intent. The functions perform straightforward encryption/decryption tasks without malicious payloads or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low risk, moderate obfuscation) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of AES CBC encryption/decryption with proper practices. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. Obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0.",
