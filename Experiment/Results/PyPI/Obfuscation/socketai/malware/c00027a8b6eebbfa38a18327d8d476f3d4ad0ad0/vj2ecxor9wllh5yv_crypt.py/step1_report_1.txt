  "purpose": "The code provides functions for encrypting and decrypting data using AES in CBC mode with base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "Input data: raw data in `nuSdTDTmdeKWMMLgxVojrkroAwFBbyVO`, key in function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted data returned as base64 string; decrypted output returned as plaintext.",
  "flows": "Input raw data → padding → encryption (AES-CBC with random IV) → base64 encode → output; base64 decode → extract IV → decrypt → remove padding → output.",
  "anomalies": "Uses predictable IV generation via randomness, which is standard but could be risky if not properly managed. No hardcoded secrets or credentials observed. No unusual control flow or obfuscated code features. The function names are non-descriptive but not suspicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard symmetric encryption with AES CBC mode. It appends PKCS#7 padding to plaintext before encryption and removes it after decryption. IV is generated randomly per encryption. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or data leaks are present. The cryptographic approach is generally correct but uses a potentially insecure method of IV management if IVs are reused or predictable. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident. The functions rely on an external import (`common.crypt`), but this is common in cryptographic modules and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement standard cryptographic functions without malicious intent or malicious behavior. There are no indications of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious network activity. The use of randomness for IVs is appropriate if managed correctly. Overall, this code does not exhibit malware traits but could be part of a larger cryptographic scheme.",
