{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for encrypting and decrypting data using AES in CBC mode with base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'key', 'raw', and 'iajVlhzWqbqSBWVPUHtHIffdKTMQjgRD' which are data provided for encryption and decryption.",
  "sinks": "Base64 encoding output of encrypted data, and decryption output which could be sensitive data, but no direct data leak or network transmission present.",
  "flows": "Input data (raw or base64 string) flows into decryption or encryption functions, with IV extracted or generated, then processed with AES, and output is encoded or decoded base64.",
  "anomalies": "Use of high-entropy random IV generation and CBC mode encryption is standard; however, the code includes functions with obfuscated-looking variable names, which may suggest an attempt to conceal intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors like network transmission or system modification are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one for encrypting data (nuSdTDTmdeKWMMLgxVojrkroAwFBbyVO) and one for decrypting data (lHwjqrcegFDfKQOdMNHNHdVrgXmTOmIy). Both functions use AES in CBC mode with a random IV, which is prepended to the ciphertext during encryption and extracted during decryption. The data is base64-encoded after encryption and decoded before decryption. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system access, or backdoors. The variable naming is obfuscated, but the core cryptographic functions are standard. The presence of the 'common.crypt' import might hint at additional functionality, but it is not used here. Overall, the code appears to implement standard cryptographic routines without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of AES CBC encryption/decryption with base64 encoding. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security violations. The obfuscation may suggest an attempt to conceal, but the core functionality is legitimate cryptography. No malware or malicious activity detected.",
