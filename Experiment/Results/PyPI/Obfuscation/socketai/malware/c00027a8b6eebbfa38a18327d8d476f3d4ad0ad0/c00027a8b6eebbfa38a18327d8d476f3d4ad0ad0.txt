      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation, indirect code execution, and import of a suspicious module during installation, which are strong indicators of malicious or backdoor behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, reflecting high suspicion and security risk. This package should be treated as potentially malicious until further analysis confirms its safety."

The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

Obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0."

      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates extensive, obfuscated modifications to core network and server functions, likely aimed at covert control or data interception. While no explicit malicious payloads are evident, the techniques employed are characteristic of malicious or stealthy behavior. The high degree of patching, obfuscation, and environment-aware modifications justify a high malware suspicion."
