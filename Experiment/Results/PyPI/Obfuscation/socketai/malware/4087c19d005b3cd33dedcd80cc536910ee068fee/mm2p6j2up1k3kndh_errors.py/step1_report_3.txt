{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes, mostly inheriting from a base exception class; no functional behavior beyond class declarations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions are static, no input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling operations present; no potential data leaks or untrusted data effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only defines class hierarchies without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Class names appear obfuscated or randomly generated, with no meaningful identifiers. No code execution, dynamic code, or suspicious logic present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions with obfuscated names, inheriting either from built-in exception classes or from each other. There is no executable code, input handling, or data processing. The purpose seems to be hiding intent or hindering readability but does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The pattern of class names suggests obfuscation, but this alone does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a set of obfuscated class definitions for custom exceptions without any malicious activity. It poses no security threat or malware risk. The obfuscation may serve to hide intent or complicate analysis but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
