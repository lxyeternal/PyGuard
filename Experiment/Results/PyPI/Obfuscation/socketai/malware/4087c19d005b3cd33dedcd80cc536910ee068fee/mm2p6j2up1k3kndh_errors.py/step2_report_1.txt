  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- All classes inherit from Exception, OSError, or other exception classes.\n- No functions, data handling, or runtime logic.\n- Class names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be an attempt at hiding or obfuscation.\n- No external interactions, data flows, or active behaviors.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Define custom exception classes.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; code only defines classes, no active logic.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, benign.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0.7 (reasonable given the nonsensical class names)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, defining exception classes with obfuscated names.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no active code, just class definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, likely obfuscation.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0.9 (appropriate)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (reasonable)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern.\n- **Analysis:** Valid; no executable code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0.8 (reasonable)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; purely class definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0.7 (reasonable)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (acceptable)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate.\n- **Conclusion:** No active malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0.9 (appropriate)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (reasonable)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** High, reflecting the nonsensical class names, which could be an attempt to hide or obfuscate code.\n- **Risk score:** Near zero, as the code is purely structural and does not perform any operations.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malware)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8 (consistent with the class names)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to obfuscation alone)\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code appears to be benign, possibly obfuscated to hinder readability.\n- No active or malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the provided code and reports.",
