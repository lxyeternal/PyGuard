{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with obfuscated names, likely for structural or placeholder purposes.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception, OSError, or other exception classes; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions present; code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static class definitions without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are nonsensical and obfuscated, indicating obfuscation but not necessarily malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only class definitions for custom exceptions with obfuscated names, no functions, data handling, or active logic. The high obfuscation scores reflect the nonsensical class names. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or external interactions are present. Malware score is zero, consistent with the absence of malicious code. Obfuscation is notable but not inherently malicious. Risk scores are low, justified by the static, benign nature of the code. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of obfuscated exception class definitions with no active or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, but there is no evidence of malware or security risk. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
