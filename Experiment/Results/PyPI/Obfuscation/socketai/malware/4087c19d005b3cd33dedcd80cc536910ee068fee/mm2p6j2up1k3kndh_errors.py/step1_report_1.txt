{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, primarily inheriting from Exception, OSError, or other exception classes.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that inherit from exception types; no input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data could leak or cause harm, as there is no executable code or data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code consists solely of class definitions with inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code. All classes are simple custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple custom exception classes, most inheriting from a base exception class or standard exceptions like OSError. There are no functions, data handling, or active behaviors that could indicate malicious activity. The code appears to be structural, intended for exception handling within a larger system. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The class names are non-descriptive, possibly obfuscated, but this alone does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes, with no active logic, data handling, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present. It appears to be a benign, structural part of a larger codebase.",
