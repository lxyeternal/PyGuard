{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling with obfuscated class names",
  "sources": "Class definitions at the beginning of the code, no external data input observed",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing or output functions present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely class declarations",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class names, no docstrings or comments, no meaningful class functionality, no imports or external data sources, no code execution or external calls, only class inheritance",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated, non-descriptive names. The classes inherit from standard exception types such as Exception and OSError. There are no functions, methods, or dynamic code execution. The structure suggests an attempt to obscure intent, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network activity. The classes do not contain any attributes or logic, indicating they serve as placeholders or markers. Overall, this appears to be an obfuscated but benign set of class definitions with no active malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of obfuscated class definitions for exceptions, with no operational or malicious behavior detected. The obfuscation may be intended to hide intent, but in its current form, it appears harmless.",
