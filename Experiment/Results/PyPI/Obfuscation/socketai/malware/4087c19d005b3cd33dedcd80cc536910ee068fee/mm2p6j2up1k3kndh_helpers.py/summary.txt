  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a network utility with significant obfuscation and proxy validation logic. While no direct malware is detected, the obfuscation and proxy enforcement could be exploited maliciously. Further analysis of the imported modules and runtime behavior is recommended before deployment in security-sensitive contexts."
