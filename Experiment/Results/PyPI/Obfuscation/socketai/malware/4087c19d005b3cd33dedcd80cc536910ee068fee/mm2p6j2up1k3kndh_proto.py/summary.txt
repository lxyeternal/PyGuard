  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants cautious review, but static analysis does not justify a malware classification. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis, with a low malware score (0.0–0.2), high obfuscation (0.75–0.8), and moderate security risk (0.2–0.45)."
