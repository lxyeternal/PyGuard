      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, characterized by heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and system manipulation. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified given these behaviors. It should be flagged as malicious and avoided in any deployment."

      "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet and the absence of detailed evidence, there is no indication of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is superficial and does not necessarily imply malicious intent. The reports lack substantive data, so risk and malware scores should be minimal. Further detailed analysis or context is required for a definitive assessment."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a network utility with significant obfuscation and proxy validation logic. While no direct malware is detected, the obfuscation and proxy enforcement could be exploited maliciously. Further analysis of the imported modules and runtime behavior is recommended before deployment in security-sensitive contexts."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a sophisticated, obfuscated proxy configuration module. While the obfuscation and dynamic URL handling could be exploited for malicious purposes, there is no concrete evidence of malware or sabotage. The low malware score reflects this, but caution is advised due to obfuscation. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate utility that warrants review in its deployment context."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants cautious review, but static analysis does not justify a malware classification. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis, with a low malware score (0.0–0.2), high obfuscation (0.75–0.8), and moderate security risk (0.2–0.45)."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of obfuscated exception class definitions with no active or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, but there is no evidence of malware or security risk. The current scores are appropriate and justified."
