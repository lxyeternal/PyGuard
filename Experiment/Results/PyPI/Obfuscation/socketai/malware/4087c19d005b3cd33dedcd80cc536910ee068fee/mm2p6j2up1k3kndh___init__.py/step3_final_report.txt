  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on code content, obfuscation, and potential vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Imports with obfuscated names, version string, __all__ declaration",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks or untrusted data flows in the provided snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow indicating malicious activity; primarily import statements and metadata",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import names, minimal code structure, absence of functional logic",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module with obfuscated class and function names, likely part of a larger framework or library. No network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The reports indicate 'Empty response' with no detailed data, making it impossible to identify vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent; without additional context or evidence, the code appears benign. The lack of detailed findings suggests the scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be very low. The code's structure does not reveal any suspicious patterns or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet and the absence of detailed evidence, there is no indication of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is superficial and does not necessarily imply malicious intent. The reports lack substantive data, so risk and malware scores should be minimal. Further detailed analysis or context is required for a definitive assessment.",
