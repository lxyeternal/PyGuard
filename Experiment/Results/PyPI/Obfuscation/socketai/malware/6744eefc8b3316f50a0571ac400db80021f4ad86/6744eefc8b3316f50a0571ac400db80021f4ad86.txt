      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior aimed at covertly exfiltrating user data from Telegram Desktop directories. It uses hardcoded credentials, suppresses errors, and communicates with an external server, fitting the profile of malware. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score is justified at 0.9. The obfuscation score remains low (around 0.2) due to code clarity but slightly elevated because of the decoy 'setuptools.setup()' call. The behavior warrants prompt detection and removal."
