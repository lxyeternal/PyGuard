  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are minimal or placeholders; no external or untrusted data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows identified; no untrusted data handling or potential leaks detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks due to lack of active code; code is either benign or placeholder.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or presence of placeholder scripts; no suspicious functions, obfuscation, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "All reports conclude benign code with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. Malware scores are consistently zero, and security risk scores are low (0 or 0.2). Confidence levels are high, reflecting the limited scope and benign nature of the code. Given the absence of suspicious patterns or actual code, the risk scores should be minimized further. The assessments are consistent and appropriate, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. Scores are accurate; the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The security risk score can be reduced to 0 across all reports to better reflect the absence of any security concerns.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
