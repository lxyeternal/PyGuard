  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to involve data processing, possibly related to user input or external data handling.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, input functions, or external modules; specific data sources are not explicitly shown due to lack of code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data outputs, but specifics are not provided in the current code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., user input or environment variables) to sinks via intermediate processing, but details are not visible without the actual code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are identified due to lack of code content.",
  "analysis": "The provided input contains no code to analyze. Therefore, there are no observable sources, sinks, or flows. No anomalies or suspicious patterns can be identified without actual code. The absence of code prevents detection of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "No code was provided for review. As a result, no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation can be assessed. The evaluation cannot be completed without the actual code content.",
