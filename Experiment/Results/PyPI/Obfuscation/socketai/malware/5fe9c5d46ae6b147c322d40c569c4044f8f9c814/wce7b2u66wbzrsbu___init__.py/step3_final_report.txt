  "finalAnalysis": "All provided reports correctly identify the absence of suspicious code, malicious activity, or obfuscation, assigning appropriate scores accordingly. The malware and obfuscated scores are consistently zero, reflecting no evidence of malicious intent. The security risk scores are uniformly low (0.2), which is reasonable given the minimal or absent code content, though slightly conservative. Confidence levels vary based on the amount of information, with higher confidence where analysis is more thorough. Overall, the scores are consistent with the findings, and no adjustments are necessary.",
