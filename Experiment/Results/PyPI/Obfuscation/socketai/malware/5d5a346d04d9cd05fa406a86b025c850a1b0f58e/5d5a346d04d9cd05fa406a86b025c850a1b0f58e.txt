      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious, potentially malicious behavior through the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The pattern suggests malicious payload delivery or backdoor activity. Scores are justified and should be considered high until further decoding confirms benign intent."
