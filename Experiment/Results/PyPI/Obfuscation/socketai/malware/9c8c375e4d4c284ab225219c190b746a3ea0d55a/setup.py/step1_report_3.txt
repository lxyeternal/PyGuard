{
  "purpose": "Collect system information, network details, and send encoded data to an external URL.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser(), socket.gethostname(), platform.platform(), os.popen('echo $LANG'), socket connections to 8.8.8.8:53, and data assembly involving system info.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to http://numipy.openvc.org/ymal.php with base64-encoded data.",
  "flows": "System info collected from sources -> assembled into a string -> base64 encoded -> sent via HTTP request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple platform-specific code paths, obfuscated variable names, string concatenation with '###', sending system data over network, use of base64 encoding, conditional URL request based on Python version, and suspicious hardcoded string 'epeu09oskp8qbd2q'.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers user, hostname, platform, locale, and IP address information, then encodes and transmits this data to an external server. The use of obfuscated variables, concatenation, and data encoding indicates an intent to mask behavior. It does not perform obvious malicious actions like damaging files or executing reverse shells but actively exfiltrates system info, which is suspicious. The presence of network communication to an external domain without clear user consent suggests malicious intent or at least privacy invasion. The setup call does not specify a legitimate purpose related to package functionality but appears to serve as a cover for the data exfiltration activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code acts as a system info collector and exfiltrator, sending data to an external server without explicit user consent, indicating malicious behavior. It should be considered high risk for privacy invasion and potential misuse, likely part of a malicious supply chain component.",
