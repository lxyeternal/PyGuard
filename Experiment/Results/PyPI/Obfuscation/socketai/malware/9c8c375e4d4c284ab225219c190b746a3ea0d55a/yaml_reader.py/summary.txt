  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated utility for text decoding and error management with no explicit malicious behavior detected. The syntax error in __str__ should be fixed. The high obfuscation suggests caution, but the current evidence does not support a malware classification. The overall security risk is low, but further review of the entire package is recommended."
