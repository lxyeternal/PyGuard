  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and malicious potential of the analyzed open source dependency based on provided code or descriptions.",
  "sources": "No concrete code provided; analysis based on descriptions and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources identified; no data leaks or malicious actions detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows observable due to absence of code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; all reports indicate lack of code or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly acknowledge the absence of code, leading to appropriate zero scores for malware and obfuscation. The risk scores are low (around 0.2) in some reports, reflecting minimal uncertainty, which is reasonable given the limited information. Confidence scores align with the evidence, and no suspicious behaviors are indicated. Minor adjustments suggest lowering the risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 in reports with high confidence to better match the benign assessment. Overall, the scoring is consistent and justified by the lack of concrete evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed reports are consistent, cautious, and appropriate given the absence of code. No evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior exists, and the low risk scores accurately reflect the limited uncertainty. Minor score refinements can improve alignment but are not strictly necessary.",
