{
  "purpose": "Defines a Python package setup with custom install and develop commands that execute code during installation.",
  "sources": "os.environ (environment variables), user input (via environment), external URL request with encoded data",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to an external URL with encoded environment data",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> base64 encoding -> URL concatenation -> HTTP GET request",
  "anomalies": "The function iirisfunc encodes environment variables and sends the data to a suspicious URL during installation, which is unusual behavior. The long description and URL suggest a demonstration or proof of concept related to dependency confusion attacks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and defines a function to decode base64 strings. It then defines a function iirisfunc that encodes all environment variables into a base64 string and appends it to a suspicious external URL, sending a GET request during package installation or development setup. This behavior can leak environment data to an external server, which is a security concern. The setup configuration includes custom commands that invoke this function during installation, indicating an active data exfiltration step. The overall structure is standard, but the execution of environment data transmission during install/develop phases is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a mechanism to exfiltrate environment variables to an external server during package installation, which is suspicious and could be malicious. The purpose appears to be demonstrating dependency confusion or data leakage. The code demonstrates malicious intent by actively sending environment data without clear user consent.",
