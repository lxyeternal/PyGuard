  "conclusion": "The provided code actively exfiltrates environment variables during package setup, representing malicious behavior. It is a clear example of supply chain sabotage through covert data theft. The scores assigned (malware: 1, security risk: 1, obfuscated: 0) are justified based on the active data exfiltration and the malicious intent. The package should be flagged as malicious, and users should avoid installing it."
