{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'iiris' with some custom install and develop commands that perform an environment variable leak.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ, data constructed from environment variables, and the URL used for HTTP GET request.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call with a constructed URL potentially sending environment variable data to an external server.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> base64 encoding -> URL concatenation -> HTTP GET request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "The function iirisfunc encodes environment variables into base64 and sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL during installation, which is unusual and suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines functions for base64 decoding and an unusual function iirisfunc that encodes environment variables and transmits them externally. The custom install command triggers this function during installation. This behavior could be used for secret exfiltration or tracking system info without user consent. There are no other malicious actions like data theft or backdoors but the intentional environment data leakage is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs environment variable exfiltration during package installation, which is a malicious privacy violation and potentially malicious behavior. This indicates malicious intent or a supply chain attack component.",
