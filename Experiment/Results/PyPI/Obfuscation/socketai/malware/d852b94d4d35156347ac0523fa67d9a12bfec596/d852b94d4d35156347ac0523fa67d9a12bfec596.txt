      "conclusion": "The provided code actively exfiltrates environment variables during package setup, representing malicious behavior. It is a clear example of supply chain sabotage through covert data theft. The scores assigned (malware: 1, security risk: 1, obfuscated: 0) are justified based on the active data exfiltration and the malicious intent. The package should be flagged as malicious, and users should avoid installing it."

Minor score refinements, especially reducing confidence in Report 3, improve accuracy. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears low risk, with scores reflecting the absence of evidence."

No evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior exists, and the low risk scores accurately reflect the limited uncertainty. Minor score refinements can improve alignment but are not strictly necessary."
