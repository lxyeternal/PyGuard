  "sources": "Code snippets, data input points, environment variables, network calls, system functions.",

  "flows": "Sources to sinks through code execution paths, data handling, or dynamic code evaluation.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, unusual code patterns, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "All reports acknowledge the absence or incompleteness of code, limiting detailed analysis. Scores for malware and obfuscation are generally low and appropriate, with minor variations justified by mentions of obfuscation signs. Confidence levels are mostly reasonable; a slight adjustment in Report 3's confidence from 0.8 to around 0.6-0.7 would better reflect the limited evidence. No reports indicate confirmed malicious activity or significant security risks. The overall assessment remains cautious, aligning with the lack of concrete code evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and appropriately cautious given the limited data. No active malicious behavior or obfuscation is confirmed. Minor score refinements, especially reducing confidence in Report 3, improve accuracy. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears low risk, with scores reflecting the absence of evidence.",
