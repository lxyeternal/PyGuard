  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and appropriately cautious given the limited data. No active malicious behavior or obfuscation is confirmed. Minor score refinements, especially reducing confidence in Report 3, improve accuracy. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears low risk, with scores reflecting the absence of evidence."
