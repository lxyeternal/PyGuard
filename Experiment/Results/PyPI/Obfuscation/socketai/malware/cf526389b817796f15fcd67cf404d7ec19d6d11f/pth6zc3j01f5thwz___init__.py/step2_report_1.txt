  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe provided code snippets are:\n\n```python\ndef SGiRfCkRcTxgdHmQSjQVQqnaxamJMBpv(n1: int, n1:int) -> int:\n    return n1 + n2\n\ndef KVHCCYzcoIttCDSaSIukzHaSWZAXKMef(n1: int, n1:int) -> int:\n    return n1 - n2\n```\n\nImmediately, there are syntax errors:\n- Both functions have parameters named `n1` twice, which is invalid in Python.\n- The functions attempt to use `n2`, which is not defined within their scope.\n- These issues suggest either incomplete code, typos, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**Common observations:**\n- All reports recognize the functions are intended for basic arithmetic.\n- Multiple reports note the parameter naming errors (`n1` used twice), which would cause syntax errors.\n- No report indicates any malicious activity, external data leaks, or obfuscation beyond poor naming and syntax issues.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The majority of reports assign a very low security risk score (mostly 0 or 0.1), consistent with benign, flawed code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious intent detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree there is no obfuscation (score 0).\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the syntax errors and lack of malicious behavior, the overall security risk is minimal, mostly 0 or 0.1, which is appropriate.\n\n**Errors in the reports:**\n- The second report mentions a syntax error due to parameter naming, which is accurate.\n- The third report notes that `n2` is used but not defined, which is correct.\n- The last report notes the invalid duplicate parameter names and the flawed syntax.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The core issue is **syntax errors** caused by duplicate parameter names and undefined variables.\n- These are **not** signs of malicious code but rather coding mistakes or incomplete snippets.\n- There is **no evidence** of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior.\n- The code's purpose appears benign: simple arithmetic functions.\n\n### Scores Justification:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** Given the syntax errors and no malicious intent, a low risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate. No security risk is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports:**\n\n- The **malware score** should remain **0**.\n- The **obfuscated score** should remain **0**.\n- The **risk score** should be **around 0.1**, reflecting the syntax errors but no security threat.\n\n**Note:** The syntax errors suggest the code is incomplete or poorly written, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is benign but flawed.\n- No malicious or obfuscated behavior detected.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0; set the security risk at approximately 0.1, reflecting the syntax issues but no security threat.",
