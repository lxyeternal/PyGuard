{
  "purpose": "Benign arithmetic functions with syntax errors due to duplicate parameter names and undefined variables.",
  "sources": "Function parameters and internal variable references (n1, n2).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data sources; code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (n1) intended for arithmetic operations; references to undefined 'n2' suggest incomplete code; no data flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate parameter names ('n1' used twice), use of undefined variable 'n2', nonsensical function names, syntax errors prevent execution.",
  "analysis": "The code contains syntax errors due to duplicate parameter names and references to undefined variables, indicating incomplete or poorly written code rather than malicious intent. No external data leaks, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The functions perform simple arithmetic, and no malicious behavior or obfuscation techniques are detected. The syntax errors are the primary issue, not security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign but flawed, with syntax errors that prevent proper execution. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate, reflecting code quality issues rather than security threats.",
