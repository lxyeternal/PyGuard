{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define two simple mathematical functions, likely intended for arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters n1 and n2 for the functions, although there is an inconsistency with parameter naming.",
  "sinks": "The functions return arithmetic operations; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly in calculations; the data flow is straightforward from input to output.",
  "anomalies": "Parameter naming is inconsistent (both named n1) which could be a typo, but no malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions with confusing and inconsistent parameter naming. The first function attempts to return n1 + n2, but both parameters are named n1, indicating a likely typo. The second function performs subtraction similarly with a naming issue. There is no input validation, no data leakage, and no external communication. The code lacks complex logic or obfuscation and does not contain malicious code such as data exfiltration or backdoors. The apparent errors are more indicative of poorly written or incomplete code rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in nature, mainly consisting of simple arithmetic functions with naming inconsistencies. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
