{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define two simple arithmetic functions, likely intended for mathematical operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'n1' and 'n2' (though 'n2' is not properly defined), which could be from external input if used in a broader context.",
  "sinks": "Return statements are straightforward; no external data output or network activity is present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly in return statements, but due to a coding error (using 'n1' twice), the intended data flow is compromised.",
  "anomalies": "Variables 'n2' are used but not defined within the functions, indicating a coding mistake. No code obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The functions are intended to perform addition and subtraction, but both have a parameter naming error ('n1' used twice) and refer to 'n2' which is undefined, leading to a runtime error if executed. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious side effects. The code is simple, but flawed due to the variable naming issue.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains basic arithmetic functions with a variable naming bug, but no malicious intent or security risks are evident. The main concern is a coding mistake rather than malicious activity.",
