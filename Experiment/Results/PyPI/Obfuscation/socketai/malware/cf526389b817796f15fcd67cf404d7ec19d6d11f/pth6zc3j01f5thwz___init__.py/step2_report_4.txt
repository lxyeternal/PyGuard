  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippets, the described issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n```python\ndef SGiRfCkRcTxgdHmQSjQVQqnaxamJMBpv(n1: int, n1:int) -> int:\n    return n1 + n2\n\ndef KVHCCYzcoIttCDSaSIukzHaSWZAXKMef(n1: int, n1:int) -> int:\n    return n1 - n2\n```\n\n**Key observations:**\n\n- Both functions have duplicate parameter names (`n1` twice), which is invalid in Python.\n- The functions reference `n2`, which is not defined or passed as a parameter.\n- The code appears to be either incomplete, poorly written, or intentionally obfuscated.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or malicious code is present.\n- The functions perform simple arithmetic operations, with no side effects or data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Basic arithmetic functions.\n- **Findings:** Inconsistent parameter naming, no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the parameter naming issues as typos, not malicious.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.1 (probably due to code errors, not malicious intent).\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** Duplicate parameter name (`n1`), which causes syntax errors.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes syntax errors are due to coding mistakes, not malicious activity.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Findings:** Uses `n2` which is undefined; references to variables that are not declared.\n- **Analysis:** Identifies the bug but emphasizes no malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1 (due to code errors).\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Findings:** Duplicate parameter names causing syntax errors.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states the code is flawed but not malicious.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Findings:** Same syntax issues, poor code structure.\n- **Analysis:** Notes the invalid syntax but no malicious activity.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports due to syntax errors and poor coding practices, but no real security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The code snippets are primarily flawed due to syntax errors (duplicate parameter names, undefined variables), not malicious intent.\n- The security risk is minimal; the main issue is poor coding quality or incomplete code.\n- The malware score should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The risk score could be slightly higher if the code were part of a larger, insecure system, but based solely on this snippet, it remains low (~0.1 at most).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** ~0.1 (reflecting poor code quality, not security threat)\n\nThe reports are consistent with this assessment. No evidence suggests malicious activity, and the issues are primarily syntax errors and poor coding practices rather than security vulnerabilities.",
