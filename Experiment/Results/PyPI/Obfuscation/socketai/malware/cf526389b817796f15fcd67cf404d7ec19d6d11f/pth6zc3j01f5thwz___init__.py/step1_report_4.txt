{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define two functions that perform basic arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction).",
  "sources": "Input parameters n1 and n2 for each function, which are integers provided when functions are called.",
  "sinks": "The functions return computed integer values; no external data or untrusted sources are used or affected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed directly in arithmetic operations and returned, with no external data or network calls involved.",
  "anomalies": "Functions have duplicate parameter names ('n1') which is a syntax error; code structure is flawed. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two functions with invalid parameter definitions due to duplicate parameter names, which would cause syntax errors in Python. The functions perform simple arithmetic and do not read external input, write to files, or interact with network sources. No malicious behavior or malicious code patterns are evident. The flawed syntax indicates a possible mistake or incomplete code, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks; it is simply flawed due to duplicate parameter names. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are present based on this snippet.",
