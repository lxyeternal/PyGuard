{
  "purpose": "The code defines two simple mathematical functions, likely for basic arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Function parameters n1 and n1 (which appear to be a typo; probably intended as n1 and n2), but no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "None; the functions only perform arithmetic operations and return results.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into arithmetic operations without any external influence or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains parameter name duplication ('n1' used twice) which leads to a syntax error; no suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions intended for addition and subtraction, but both have the same parameter name 'n1', which is invalid in Python. The functions perform straightforward operations without external data sources or side effects. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is simple and does not exhibit any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The duplicate parameter naming is a syntactic error rather than malicious activity.",
