{
  "purpose": "The functions appear to perform simple arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction) on input integers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters n1 and n1 (note the duplicate parameter names), which are the source of data for the functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements output the result of arithmetic operations; no external data sinks or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into return expressions without any processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate parameter names ('n1' repeated), which is a syntax error in Python; no other anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions with cryptic names performing basic arithmetic. The duplicated parameter names suggest code is invalid or incomplete, which could be an error or obfuscation attempt. There are no data leaks, external connections, or malicious behaviors. The code does not do anything suspicious beyond poor naming and syntax issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is syntactically invalid due to duplicate parameter names. It appears to be simple arithmetic functions with no malicious intent. No malware or security risks are evident. The main concern is the code's correctness rather than security.",
