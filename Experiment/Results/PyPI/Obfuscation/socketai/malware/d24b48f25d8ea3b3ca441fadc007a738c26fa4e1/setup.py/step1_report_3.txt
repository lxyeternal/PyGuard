  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to download and execute an external executable file from a remote URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'CBLines.exe') for the download path; subprocess.rTxVdGUqQodJcnaJxqNxshQaRsCveSXu for executing download and start commands.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.rTxVdGUqQodJcnaJxqNxshQaRsCveSXu used to execute PowerShell commands that download and run external code.",
  "flows": "The code constructs PowerShell commands to download a remote executable and then execute it; subprocess runs these commands, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name and method names; use of dynamic PowerShell commands to download and execute an external executable, which is suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the install method. It constructs a PowerShell command to download an executable from a GitHub URL into the current directory. If the download succeeds, it attempts to open the downloaded file using PowerShell. The obfuscated naming and automatic execution of external code during package install strongly suggest malicious intent. The code does not perform any validation on the downloaded file and executes external code without user consent, which is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains obfuscated code that downloads and executes an external executable during installation, indicating malicious behavior. The code aims to surreptitiously run external code on the user's system, representing a high security risk.",
