{
  "purpose": "This code modifies the installation process to download and execute a remote executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current working directory (os.getcwd()) and the URL 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe' for downloading the executable.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file is executed via PowerShell 'Start-Process' command, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "The code fetches the executable from the URL and then opens/runs it directly, creating a source-to-sink flow from network download to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and method names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which is unusual. The code downloads and executes an external executable silently during installation, which is suspicious. Use of PowerShell commands for download and execution without user consent is a notable anomaly.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that inherits from setuptools. During installation, it constructs a PowerShell command to download an executable file from a specified URL. If the download succeeds, it proceeds to launch the executable via PowerShell 'Start-Process'. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. Downloading and executing code during package installation without explicit user knowledge is a significant security concern, indicating malicious behavior. The code does not perform any validation of the downloaded file, increasing risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote executable during package installation, with obfuscated naming to hide intent. It poses a security risk as it can run arbitrary code without user awareness, making this package highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
