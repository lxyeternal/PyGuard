{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable from a remote URL during installation and executes it without validation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'CBLines.exe') and the constructed PowerShell command to download the file from the suspicious URL.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.rTxVdGUqQodJcnaJxqNxshQaRsCveSXu() executing the PowerShell command that runs the downloaded executable.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a download command from the URL, executes it via subprocess, then executes the downloaded file via another PowerShell command.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; dynamic construction and execution of PowerShell commands; download from a suspicious GitHub URL; execution of external code without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to download an executable from a suspicious URL during package installation. It obfuscates class and method names, constructs PowerShell commands dynamically, and executes them via subprocess. The download is unverified, and the executable is run directly, posing a high security risk. The behavior aligns with malicious supply chain attacks, with high potential for system compromise. The obfuscation and remote execution are clear indicators of malicious intent. The code does not validate the downloaded file, increasing the risk of executing malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, actively downloading and executing external code during installation without validation. The obfuscation and remote URL further support malicious intent. The malware score should be set to 1, with very high security risk, reflecting the dangerous nature of this code.",
