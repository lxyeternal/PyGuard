{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the installation process to download and execute an external executable file from a specified URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current working directory (os.getcwd()), constructs a file path, and executes a PowerShell command to download a file from 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via PowerShell 'Start-Process', which could run arbitrary code with the same privileges as the installer.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a download command (source) and, upon successful download, executes the downloaded file (sink), creating a source-to-sink flow that results in running external code.",
  "anomalies": "The class and method names are obfuscated (random strings). The code downloads and executes an external file during installation without user consent. The URL is from a suspicious domain ('github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe'), which could be malicious. The download and execution are embedded inside the setup script, which is unusual and suspicious for a package installation routine.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to run a method that downloads an executable from an external URL via PowerShell. It checks if the download was successful and then executes the file. This behavior can facilitate malicious activity such as installing malware, backdoors, or other harmful code during package installation. The obfuscated class and method names further suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The download URL is suspicious, and executing an external executable during package installation poses a significant security risk. The code does not perform any validation or verification of the downloaded file, increasing the danger.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It downloads and executes an external executable during installation without user knowledge or consent, representing a serious security threat. The obfuscation and embedded external download indicate malicious intent.",
