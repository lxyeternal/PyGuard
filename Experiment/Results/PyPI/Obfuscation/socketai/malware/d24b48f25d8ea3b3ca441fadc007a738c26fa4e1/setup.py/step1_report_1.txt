{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script that, during installation, downloads and executes an external executable from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd() for the download path, subprocess calls for executing commands, and the URL 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe' for downloading the executable.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing the downloaded executable, which may run arbitrary code; also, invoking 'Start-Process' to open the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "The code downloads a file from a remote URL using PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest, saves it locally, and then executes it via PowerShell Start-Process.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically downloads an executable during installation without user consent, executes it automatically, and uses obfuscated variable and class names, which are common in malicious scripts. The URL points to a suspicious GitHub raw link, and the code runs a downloaded file without validation.",
  "analysis": "The script hijacks the setup process by extending the install command. It constructs a PowerShell command to download an executable from a remote URL, saving it to the current directory. If successful, it proceeds to execute this executable using PowerShell, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution. The obfuscated class and variable names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The remote URL hosted on GitHub appears suspicious and not related to legitimate package sources. The script performs actions that could compromise the system security, including downloading and executing code without validation or user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, as it downloads and executes an external executable during installation without user consent, and uses obfuscation techniques. This behavior indicates a supply chain attack vector, potentially installing malware or backdoors.",
