  "purpose": "A simple print statement outputting 'hello' with no external inputs or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static code with no input reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks due to static nature.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a trivial print statement with no inputs, external dependencies, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
