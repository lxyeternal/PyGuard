  "purpose": "The code outputs the string 'hello' to the console.",
  "sources": "Input sources are none; no data is read or imported.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the print() function which outputs data to standard output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the print statement outputs a static string.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hidden code, or suspicious constructs; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a print statement displaying 'hello'. There are no inputs, no external data sources, and no complex operations. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or file operations. Given its simplicity, there are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent. It appears to be a benign, introductory code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is completely benign, performing a basic output operation with no malicious or suspicious elements detected.",
