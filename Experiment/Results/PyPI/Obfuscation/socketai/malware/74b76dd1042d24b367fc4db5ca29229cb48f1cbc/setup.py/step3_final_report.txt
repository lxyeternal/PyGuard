{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script that, on macOS, collects system information via system commands, encodes it, and exfiltrates it to a remote IP during package installation, indicating malicious activity.",
  "sources": "System commands ('uname -a', 'id', 'pwd', 'ifconfig') executed via os.popen() to gather system info.",
  "sinks": "Network request via os.system() executing curl to send encoded data to external IP address.",
  "flows": "Source: system commands -> data serialization and encoding -> URL construction with encoded data -> sink: os.system() executing curl command to exfiltrate data.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate execution of data exfiltration during setup, use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded external IP, and collection of sensitive system info without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs malicious data exfiltration by collecting system info and transmitting it to an external server during package installation. The function is conditionally executed on macOS and is invoked immediately, indicating active malicious intent. The obfuscation via variable names and encoding further suggests malicious concealment. The network request to a hardcoded IP is suspicious. All reports correctly identify these behaviors, assigning high malware and security risk scores. The logic is sound, with no false assumptions; the behavior is clearly malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains active malicious behavior involving system info collection and exfiltration during setup, representing a high security threat. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, obfuscated ~0.8, security risk ~0.9-1.0) are justified and consistent with the observed behavior.",
