{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package with some potentially malicious behavior embedded within the installation script.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, executing system commands via os.popen, constructing a URL with system information, and executing a curl command.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a curl command that sends data to a remote server, base64-encoded data potentially sent over the network.",
  "flows": "System commands (uname, id, pwd, ifconfig) collect system info → info is encoded and sent to a remote URL via curl in the os.system call.",
  "anomalies": "The function SHFntrAZhbrsxjIeoQnpynnLDkfewJKn collects system information and sends it to an external IP address without user consent. The URL is hardcoded with an IP address. The code imports both setuptools and distutils unnecessarily. It executes a system command immediately upon import, indicating possible backdoor behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the README file, then, if on macOS ('darwin'), defines and executes a function that collects system info including OS details, user ID, working directory, and network configuration. This data is encoded in base64 (with differences based on Python version) and sent via a curl request to a specific IP address. The package setup details include a seemingly innocuous package name and description but contain obfuscated or placeholder variables. The immediate execution of network-related commands during import suggests malicious intent to exfiltrate system info without user knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior: it collects sensitive system information and exfiltrates it to a remote server upon installation. The obfuscated function names and immediate data transmission indicate an intent to spy or backdoor the system. Overall, the package exhibits malicious behavior with high confidence.",
