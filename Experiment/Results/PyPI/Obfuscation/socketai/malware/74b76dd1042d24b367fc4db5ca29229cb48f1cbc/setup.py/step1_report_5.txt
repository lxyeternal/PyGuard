{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, primarily used for packaging and distribution purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from 'README.md' and system commands executed via os.popen() within the function SHFntrAZhbrsxjIeoQnpynnLDkfewJKn()",
  "sinks": "The function constructs a URL with encoded system information and uses os.system() to send a curl request to an external IP address, potentially leaking system data.",
  "flows": "System information collected via os.popen() flows into JSON serialization and base64 encoding, then flows into a URL which is accessed by os.system() with a curl command, potentially transmitting data externally.",
  "anomalies": "The function SHFntrAZhbrsxjIeoQnpynnLDkfewJKn() gathers system info, encodes it, and exfiltrates it via an HTTP request to an IP address. This behavior is suspicious for a setup script, especially as it runs unconditionally on macOS. The URL is hardcoded to an external IP, which is a typical indicator of malicious activity or command-and-control communication.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and reads a README file. On macOS, it defines a function that collects sensitive system information (uname, id, pwd, ifconfig), encodes this info in base64, and then exfiltrates it by sending a request to a remote server via curl. The function is called immediately after definition, meaning this behavior executes during package setup. The package metadata appears typical except for the suspicious code. The URL used ('http:/81.70.191.194:14333/start/') is potentially malicious, indicating data exfiltration. The use of untrusted system commands and external network requests during setup is a security concern. No other malicious code or backdoors are detected outside this function.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a clear malicious behavior: during package setup on macOS, it exfiltrates system information to an external IP address without user consent. This constitutes a security threat and potential data leakage. The rest of the setup code appears normal, but the embedded exfiltration behavior is malicious.",
