{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, including some system information gathering and a function that contacts a remote server with encoded system details.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; system commands executed via os.popen; hardcoded URL and command strings; environment variables and system info collected in SHFntrAZhbrsxjIeoQnpynnLDkfewJKn.",
  "sinks": "os.system call that executes a curl command to send data to a remote server; base64-encoded system info potentially used for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "System info gathered via os.popen, encoded in base64, then sent via os.system with curl to remote URL.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of system commands that collect sensitive information (uname, id, pwd, ifconfig) and send it to a remote server; use of base64 encoding; execution of external network request during package setup. The function is invoked during setup, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, but it contains code that collects system information, encodes it, and transmits it to a remote IP address via a curl request, which is not typical behavior for a standard setup script. The code also reads a README file, but the main suspicious part is the function SHFntrAZhbrsxjIeoQnpynnLDkfewJKn(), which is called during setup and performs data exfiltration. This behavior indicates malicious intent, likely to spy on the user’s system and send sensitive information to an external server without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by gathering system information and exfiltrating it to a remote server during package installation. This is a clear supply chain security risk, indicating the package may be intentionally malicious or compromised. The use of encoded system info and network communication during setup is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious.",
