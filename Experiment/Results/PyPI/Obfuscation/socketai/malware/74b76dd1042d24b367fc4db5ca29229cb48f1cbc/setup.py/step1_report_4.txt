{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration and includes a conditional function that performs system information collection and exfiltration on macOS systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file; on macOS, it executes system commands ('uname -a', 'id', 'pwd', 'ifconfig') via os.popen; it constructs a URL with base64-encoded system info and uses os.system to send data via curl.",
  "sinks": "os.system call that executes 'curl' to send collected data to an external IP address.",
  "flows": "On macOS, system commands gather sensitive system info, which is then base64-encoded and appended to a URL; os.system executes a curl command to send data to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a function that gathers sensitive system info and exfiltrates it without user consent, executed conditionally on macOS; the use of base64 encoding to obscure data; the setup includes a malicious-appearing URL with a hardcoded IP address.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing modules and reading 'README.md'. It then re-imports setup and Extension modules redundantly. The function 'SHFntrAZhbrsxjIeoQnpynnLDkfewJKn' is defined only on macOS, where it collects system info (hostname, user id, current directory, network config). This info is assembled into a dictionary, serialized to JSON, encoded in base64 (with handling differences between Python 2 and 3), and sent via a curl command to an external IP address. This function executes immediately upon import, meaning any installation of this package on macOS triggers data exfiltration. The setup call includes typical package metadata but also sets a 'console_scripts' entry point.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it secretly collects system information on macOS and transmits it to an external server without user consent. The exfiltration is obfuscated using base64 encoding, and the data flow occurs during package installation. This behavior poses a significant security risk and indicates malicious intent.",
