{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup configuration for a Python package, but also includes code that executes system commands and makes network requests, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md', system commands via os.popen('uname -a'), 'id', 'pwd', 'ifconfig', and reading 'sys.platform'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of os.system() with a constructed URL containing base64-encoded system information, which is sent via curl, potentially exfiltrating system data.",
  "flows": "System info gathered from system commands (sources) is encoded and appended to a URL, then sent via os.system() call (sink), possibly exfiltrating data.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code that collects system information and sends it over the network without clear purpose; redundant imports, double import of setup and Extension modules, use of base64 encoding for obfuscation; the network request to an IP address (81.70.191.194) is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing setup and Extension from setuptools and distutils, which is typical for package setup scripts. However, it contains a function 'SHFntrAZhbrsxjIeoQnpynnLDkfewJKn' that, on MacOS platforms, executes several system commands to gather system info (uname, id, pwd, ifconfig). It encodes this info in base64, with a different handling for Python 2 and Python 3, then constructs a URL containing this encoded data and uses 'curl' via os.system() to send a GET request to an IP address. This behavior indicates potential data exfiltration. The setup call at the end defines a package with specific metadata but does not seem directly malicious. The code's obfuscation of system info collection and exfiltration step strongly suggest malicious intent, possibly for unauthorized system monitoring or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The script includes legitimate setup configuration code but also contains obfuscated and suspicious system info collection and exfiltration behavior. The network request to an external IP with encoded system data indicates malicious intent, likely to secretly collect and send system information without user consent.",
