  "conclusion": "The code contains active malicious behavior involving system info collection and exfiltration during setup, representing a high security threat. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, obfuscated ~0.8, security risk ~0.9-1.0) are justified and consistent with the observed behavior."
