{
  "purpose": "The code collects environment variables, SSH private keys, and '.env' files, encodes this data in base64, and exfiltrates it to a hardcoded external IP address, likely for malicious data theft.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, SSH private key file (~/.ssh/id_rsa), files with '.env' extension, system commands to locate these files.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing 'curl' commands to send encoded data to http://65.1.221.11:1337/.",
  "flows": "Sources (environment variables, SSH keys, env files) -> encoding in base64 -> network exfiltration via subprocess 'curl' commands.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, dynamic URL construction, silent exception handling, execution during package setup commands, platform-specific file searches.",
  "analysis": "The code is intentionally obfuscated, reads sensitive data from system files and environment variables, encodes this data, and transmits it to an external server during package installation routines. The use of subprocess with curl, hardcoded IP, and the timing during setup indicates malicious intent. The code does not perform legitimate setup tasks and actively exfiltrates data, which is characteristic of malware designed for data theft and backdoor access.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including data exfiltration of sensitive information, obfuscation to hide intent, and integration into package setup routines. It should be classified as high severity malware with a high security risk.",
