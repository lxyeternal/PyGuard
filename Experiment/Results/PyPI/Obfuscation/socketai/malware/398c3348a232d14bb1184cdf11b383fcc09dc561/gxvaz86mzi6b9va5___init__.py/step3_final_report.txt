{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle data input and processing, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation noted.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, files, or user input.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or external connections), but specific paths are not detailed due to lack of code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, dynamic execution, or malicious behavior. The high confidence score (0.8) and low security risk (0.2) are justified based on the description. No suspicious signals or anomalies are present; the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely safe with no malicious intent. The risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and the overall assessment indicates minimal security concern.",
