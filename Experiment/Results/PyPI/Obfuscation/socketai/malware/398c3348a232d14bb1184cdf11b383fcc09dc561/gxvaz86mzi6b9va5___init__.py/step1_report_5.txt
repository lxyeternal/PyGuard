{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose is unclear due to the lack of comments and context.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from user input (e.g., input() function) or environment variables. Possible reading of external files or network sources is not evident.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe functions such as executing system commands (os.system, subprocess), or writing to files, which could be exploited if input is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources to sinks through variables; no clear malicious flow identified without execution of external commands or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code does not perform obfuscated operations. No unusual or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. It uses common Python functions and libraries. No external or network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The absence of comments and context limits detailed understanding, but nothing suspicious appears from static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the static review, the code does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign with no indications of malware, data leaks, or supply chain sabotage.",
