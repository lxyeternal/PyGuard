  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to handling data input and performing some form of processing, potentially involving network or file operations.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user input, or external files; specific source functions or input points are not explicitly shown in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file write operations, or data output functions; exact sink points are not explicitly detailed in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/environment variables) to sinks (outputs, network, files), but explicit source-to-sink paths are unclear due to missing context.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution detected; code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code demonstrates standard Python structures without signs of obfuscation. No suspicious imports or functions are evident. The absence of explicit external connections or malicious patterns suggests no malicious intent. However, without full context, subtle issues cannot be completely ruled out. There are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. The structure appears typical for a legitimate data processing script.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears benign and intended for normal data handling. The confidence score is high due to lack of suspicious elements, but limited context restricts absolute certainty.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
