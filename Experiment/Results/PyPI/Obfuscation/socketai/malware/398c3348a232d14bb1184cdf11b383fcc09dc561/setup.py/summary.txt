  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and performs system modifications, package management, and privilege checks that are characteristic of malicious backdoors or sabotage scripts. The high obfuscation score (1), malware score (0.8), and risk score (0.85) are justified given the behavior. It should be considered malicious and handled with caution in supply chain security contexts."
