{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather system uptime and environment information, then sends this data to a remote IP address, possibly for tracking or malicious exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads from '/proc/uptime' (system uptime), uses 'platform' module for OS details, 'socket' module for IP and network connection.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to IP '134.209.85.64' on port 80, sending system info data over the network.",
  "flows": "Reads system info -> formats data -> establishes socket connection -> sends data to remote IP.",
  "anomalies": "Connects to an external IP address without any apparent legitimate reason, uses hardcoded IP. Data is sent immediately upon installation, suggesting potential data exfiltration or tracking. Code structure and variable names are obfuscated, which may hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules but then executes a function that reads system uptime from '/proc/uptime', gathers system and platform info, and sends this info via a socket connection to a hardcoded external IP. The code is executed during the installation process of a package, which is suspicious. The IP address is hardcoded and the data transmission occurs automatically without user consent. The obfuscated variable names and lack of documentation suggest an attempt to hide malicious activity. No other malicious behavior such as code injection, file manipulation, or persistence mechanisms is evident, but data exfiltration at install time is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits potentially malicious behavior by collecting system info and sending it to an external server during package installation. It may be used for tracking, surveillance, or data theft. The obfuscation and the nature of network communication elevate the security risk. The overall risk score is high, and this package should be scrutinized or avoided.",
