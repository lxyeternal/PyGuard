  "purpose": "The code collects system uptime, OS details, hostname, and IP address, then transmits this information to an external server during package installation, indicating malicious intent for data exfiltration.",

  ],
  "analysis": "The code performs system info collection and transmits it to an external IP during setup, with obfuscated identifiers. This pattern is characteristic of malicious backdoors or spyware. The network activity occurs automatically during installation, with no user awareness. The obfuscation and hardcoded IP further support malicious intent. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware, obfuscation, security risk) are justified by these behaviors, indicating a high probability of malicious activity and significant security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through automatic data exfiltration during package installation, obfuscation, and hardcoded external communication. The activity poses a high security risk and warrants classification as malware. The reports' assessments and scores are consistent with these findings.",
