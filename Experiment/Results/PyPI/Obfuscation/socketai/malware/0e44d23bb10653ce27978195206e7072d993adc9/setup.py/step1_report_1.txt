{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information and send it to an external server, possibly for surveillance or unauthorized data collection.",
  "sources": "Reads from '/proc/uptime', platform information via 'platform' module, socket.gethostname(), and socket.gethostbyname() for IP details.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to IP 134.209.85.64 on port 80, sending system info data.",
  "flows": "Reads system uptime and platform info -> formats data -> establishes socket connection -> sends data to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual pattern of collecting system info and immediately sending it over a network to an IP address without user consent. The code uses obfuscated function names and imports from setup tools in a suspicious manner. Hardcoded external IP address involved in data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that gathers system uptime, OS details, and IP address. It then creates a socket connection to a specific external IP (134.209.85.64) on port 80 and sends the gathered information. This activity suggests data exfiltration without user consent, indicative of malicious intent. The use of obfuscated names and the timing of data collection during installation (via a custom install command class) further indicates an attempt to hide malicious behavior. There is no legitimate reason for this code to collect system info and transmit it to an external server within a package installation process.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and exfiltrating it to an external server without user approval. It is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous, representing a privacy violation and possible backdoor activity.",
