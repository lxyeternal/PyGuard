{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather system information and send it to an external IP address upon installation.",
  "sources": "Reads from /proc/uptime, platform module functions, socket.gethostname()",
  "sinks": "socket connection to IP 134.209.85.64 on port 80, sending data over network",
  "flows": "Reads system uptime and details -> constructs string -> opens socket connection -> sends data to external server",
  "anomalies": "Unusual network activity during package installation, hidden data transmission in setup process, obfuscated function and variable names, no clear legitimate purpose for data collection",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that collects system uptime, OS info, and IP address, then establishes a socket connection to a remote IP address and sends the collected data. The function is called during the custom installation process via a subclass of setuptools' install command, indicating this network activity occurs during package installation. No user input or environment variables are used to influence the data collection. The remote IP and data transmission are suspicious, indicating potential malicious activity such as data exfiltration. The code is intentionally obfuscated through cryptic function and variable names, and the data is sent unencrypted to a fixed IP, which is characteristic of malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to an external server during installation, without user consent. This suggests potential malicious intent, such as data theft or remote control setup. The obfuscation and timing further support this assessment.",
