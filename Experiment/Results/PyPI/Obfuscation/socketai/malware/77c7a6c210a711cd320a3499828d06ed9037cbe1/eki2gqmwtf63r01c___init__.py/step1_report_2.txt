{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed to extract Roblox user information and cookies from the user's browser, verify the cookie validity, gather user data via Roblox APIs, and send this information to a Discord webhook, potentially for malicious data collection or abuse.",
  "sources": "Reads cookies from browser storage (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera), retrieves external IP address, fetches Roblox user info via API calls, and reads environment variables for cookies.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected user data and cookies to a Discord webhook URL, which can leak sensitive data externally. Also executes system commands via os.system.",
  "flows": "Browser cookies -> Roblox API calls -> Webhook POST request with user data and cookies -> System commands (via os.system) if needed.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obfuscated variable names, contains hardcoded webhook URL, attempts to access cookies across multiple browsers, and includes code execution functions that could run arbitrary commands. Some variables are undefined (e.g., 'roblox_cookie', 'rid') indicating incomplete code or potential obfuscation. The code also constructs messages with user info, which can be misused.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by importing modules and defining functions for executing system commands and clearing the console. It retrieves Roblox cookies from various browsers by searching for the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie. It then validates the cookie via a Roblox API call. Upon validation, it fetches user info such as UserID, username, Robux balance, premium status, account age, creation date, and headshot. It constructs URLs for user profiles and external sites like Rolimons, though some variables (like 'rid', 'rolimons', 'roblox_profile') are undefined, indicating incomplete or obfuscated code. Finally, it posts collected data to a Discord webhook URL, which is hardcoded, potentially for malicious data exfiltration. The presence of obfuscated variable names and functions, along with the execution of system commands, suggests an intent to hide malicious behavior. Overall, the script is designed to collect user data and send it to an external server, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is likely malicious, as it collects Roblox cookies and user information across browsers, validates and retrieves user data, then exfiltrates the information via a webhook. The obfuscated variable names, incomplete variable references, and use of system commands indicate malicious intent, possibly for data theft or abuse.",
