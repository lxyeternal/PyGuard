{
  "purpose": "The script appears to gather Roblox user data, including cookies, user info, and profile details, and then potentially share this information via a webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (firefox, chrome, edge, opera), HTTP GET requests to retrieve IP and Roblox user info, local OS commands, and input data from the environment.",
  "sinks": "Webhook POST request sending potentially sensitive Roblox cookie and user info, system commands via os.system, and data fetched from user profile and IP services.",
  "flows": "Cookies are collected from browser storage -> cookies validated via robloxpy -> user info fetched from Roblox API -> data compiled and sent via webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, obfuscated variable names, multiple silent exception blocks, and use of system commands (os.system) without validation. Also, the code attempts to send Roblox cookie data externally, indicating malicious intent. The code is inconsistent and contains undefined variables and incomplete URL strings, suggesting obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple libraries, including os, requests, and browser_cookie3, to access browser cookies related to Roblox, then attempts to validate and extract user data. It makes external requests to obtain the IP address and Roblox user info. The code then prepares a webhook message containing user data and cookies, which suggests data exfiltration. The use of hardcoded webhook URL, silent exception handling, and variable obfuscation indicate malicious intent. The code’s purpose appears to be to steal Roblox cookies and personal information for malicious purposes, such as account hijacking or identity theft.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to collect Roblox cookies and user info and exfiltrate them via a webhook, indicating malicious intent with potential for account theft. The obfuscated variable names, hardcoded webhook URL, and silent error handling increase suspicion. Overall, this is malicious code aimed at data theft.",
