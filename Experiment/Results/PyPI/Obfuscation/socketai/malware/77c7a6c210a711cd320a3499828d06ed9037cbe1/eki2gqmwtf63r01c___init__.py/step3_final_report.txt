{
  "purpose": "The code extracts Roblox cookies from various browsers, validates them via Roblox API, retrieves user information, and exfiltrates this data to an external webhook, indicating malicious intent for data theft.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) for domain 'roblox.com', external IP API request, and hardcoded webhook URL.",
  "sinks": "Webhook POST request sending cookies and user info, execution of system commands via os.system, and external HTTP requests for validation and data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Cookie extraction from browsers -> cookie validation via Roblox API -> user info retrieval -> data compilation -> POST request to webhook with user data and cookies.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, incomplete variable references (e.g., 'rid', 'roblox_cookie', 'rolimons'), use of os.system commands, try-except blocks suppressing errors, and hardcoded webhook URL, indicating obfuscation and malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to harvest Roblox cookies from multiple browsers, validate them, and collect user data such as UserID, username, balance, account age, and creation date. It constructs URLs with undefined variables, suggesting incomplete or intentionally obfuscated code. The code then exfiltrates this data via a webhook, which is a typical malicious activity. The use of os.system commands and silent exception handling further indicates malicious intent to hide activity. The high obfuscation and incomplete variables support the conclusion that this is malicious code designed for data theft and privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, primarily designed to steal Roblox cookies and user information, and exfiltrate this data to an external server. Its obfuscation and incomplete variable references suggest an attempt to hide malicious activity. The behavior warrants a high malware score and security risk assessment.",
