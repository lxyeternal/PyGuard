  "purpose": "A minimal Python setup script defining package name, version, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the package name, version string, and dependencies in setup()",
  "sinks": "Potential misuse of dependencies for malicious activities such as data exfiltration or automation",
  "flows": "From dependencies (sources) to potential malicious actions (sinks), if used maliciously in larger context",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name and package name; no actual malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with obfuscated identifiers, which could be an attempt to hide intent. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are evident. Dependencies are common but can be exploited if misused. Obfuscation and package naming are suspicious but not definitive of malicious intent. The malware score is zero, consistent with no malicious code detected. Obfuscation and dependency concerns warrant caution, but the code itself appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is present. Obfuscation and dependency choices suggest caution but do not constitute an immediate threat.",
