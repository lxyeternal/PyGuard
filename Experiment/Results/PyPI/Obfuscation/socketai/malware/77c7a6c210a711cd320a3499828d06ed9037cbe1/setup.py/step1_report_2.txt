  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with specific dependencies.",

  "sinks": "N/A — No direct data sinks or external output functions.",
  "flows": "Initialization of setup configuration with dependencies; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'eki2gqmwtf63r01c' appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which could suggest malicious intent. The variable name 'xWXpXwBEnqFYAmLBcbvUkmIhHciDzXwA' is also obfuscated. The dependencies include common packages, but without additional context, their usage could be suspicious if malicious code is embedded elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, using setuptools. It assigns a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name and calls 'setup' with a package name that appears deliberately obscured. The dependencies listed include 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests', which could be used for benign purposes or malicious activities such as retrieving cookies, sending data to Discord, or interacting with Roblox. The obfuscated package name and variable name are typical indicators of possible malicious intent or an attempt to hide the true purpose of the package. No malicious code is directly present in this snippet, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The script itself is minimal and appears to be a typical setup configuration. However, the obfuscated package name and variable suggest potential malicious intent, especially if paired with malicious code elsewhere. The dependencies could facilitate data theft or command-and-control activities if misused.",
