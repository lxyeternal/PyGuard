  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'eki2gqmwtf63r01c', specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "The package name, version string, and install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "Dependencies list and setup function execution (installation process).",
  "flows": "Reading package name, version, and dependencies; then executing setup to install dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable name 'xWXpXwBEnqFYAmLBcbvUkmIhHciDzXwA' instead of clear identifiers; dependencies include 'browser_cookie3' and 'discordwebhook' which can be used for data exfiltration or automation; minimal code logic but dependencies can be malicious if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script using setuptools. The variable name is obfuscated, possibly to hide intent. The dependencies 'browser_cookie3' and 'discordwebhook' could be used maliciously for stealing cookies or sending data via Discord webhooks. The setup script itself does not perform malicious actions but relies on dependencies that could be abused. No direct malware code or suspicious behavior is present in this snippet, but the presence of certain packages warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable naming. It installs dependencies that could be misused maliciously, but the script itself does not contain malicious code. Overall, moderate concern due to dependencies rather than code logic.",
