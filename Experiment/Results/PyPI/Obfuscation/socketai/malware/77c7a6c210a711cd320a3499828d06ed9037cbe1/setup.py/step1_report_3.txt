{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with specific dependencies, likely for a larger project or application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'install_requires' list to specify required packages. The version string '1.0.0' is hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input; no network or data leaks directly shown.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration indicates dependency installation but no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'eki2gqmwtf63r01c' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious. The variable name 'xWXpXwBEnqFYAmLBcbvUkmIhHciDzXwA' is unusually complex and non-descriptive, possibly hiding intent. No other suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup using 'setuptools'. It defines a version string and specifies dependencies, including 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. The obfuscated package name and variable name suggest an attempt to conceal purpose, which warrants caution. The dependencies themselves are common but could be used maliciously if misused; however, the setup code itself does not include malicious actions. There are no input sources, data sinks, or suspicious flows evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package, but the obfuscated package name and variable name could be red flags. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or malware in this code snippet. Nonetheless, caution is advised due to obfuscation and dependency choices.",
