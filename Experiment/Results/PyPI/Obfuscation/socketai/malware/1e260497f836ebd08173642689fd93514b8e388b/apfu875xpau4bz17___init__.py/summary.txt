  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are consistent and appropriate in their assessments. The malware, obfuscated, and overall risk scores should remain at 0, with confidence levels reflecting the lack of code. Minor risk score adjustments are optional but not necessary."
