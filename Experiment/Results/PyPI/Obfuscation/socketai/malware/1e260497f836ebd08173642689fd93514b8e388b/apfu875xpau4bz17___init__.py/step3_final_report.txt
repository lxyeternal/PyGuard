  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the provided open-source dependency code, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "No code provided; absence of input data or code snippets.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, as no code exists.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows due to lack of code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, placeholders, or incomplete snippets; no suspicious patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code, noting that no sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors can be observed. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the lack of executable content. Confidence levels are generally low or zero, reflecting the limited information. Minor risk score adjustments (e.g., from 0.2 to 0) could be considered for conservativeness, but current scores are acceptable. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the reasoning is consistent across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are consistent and appropriate in their assessments. The malware, obfuscated, and overall risk scores should remain at 0, with confidence levels reflecting the lack of code. Minor risk score adjustments are optional but not necessary.",
