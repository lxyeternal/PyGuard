      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious and potentially malicious behavior through obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup. The high scores reflect the strong indicators of malicious intent, such as obfuscation, silent execution, and conditional activation. Without decoding the payload, absolute certainty cannot be confirmed, but the evidence warrants high suspicion and caution."
