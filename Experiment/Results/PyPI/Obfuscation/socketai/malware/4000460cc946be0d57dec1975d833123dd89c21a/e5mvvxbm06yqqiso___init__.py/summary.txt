  "conclusion": "The assessments and scores across reports are generally consistent with their descriptions. The most suspicious code (Report 3) justifies a malware score of 0.6 and risk of 0.75. Benign reports correctly assign zero or low scores. Minor adjustments, such as lowering the risk score for benign code, improve alignment. Overall, the evaluation accurately reflects the security posture of the analyzed dependencies."
