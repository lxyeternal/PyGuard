  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or system interaction, but the specific purpose cannot be fully determined due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Input reading occurs via environment variables, file reads, or user input functions (if present). Specific source points are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls that could send data externally or modify system state.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables, files) to sinks (network, file system, system commands). Exact paths are unclear due to incomplete code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. No obfuscated or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks explicit malicious indicators such as malicious network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoor functions. Usage of standard libraries and functions appears normal. Without further context or hidden logic, there are no signs of malicious behavior. However, the absence of detailed code makes comprehensive analysis limited.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but the analysis is limited due to incomplete information.",
