{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies, ensuring supply chain integrity.",
  "sources": "Code input/output handling, environment variable access, network connections, file operations, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable usage, system commands, data leaks, external API calls.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs flow into processing functions, which may lead to sinks like network transmissions or file modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code structures detected; code snippets are incomplete but show no signs of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are incomplete; however, the analysis across all reports indicates no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. Scores are consistent with the limited visibility, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and low security risk scores (~0.2). Confidence levels are moderate, reflecting the incomplete data. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified, and the reasoning aligns with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the code appears benign. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence; no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
