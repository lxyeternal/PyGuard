  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment data during package setup, using obfuscation and suspicious endpoints to hide intent. The pattern is consistent across reports, and scores of high malware (around 0.8), obfuscation (around 0.8-0.9), and security risk (around 0.8) are justified. The package should be flagged and further investigated before use."
