      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment data during package setup, using obfuscation and suspicious endpoints to hide intent. The pattern is consistent across reports, and scores of high malware (around 0.8), obfuscation (around 0.8-0.9), and security risk (around 0.8) are justified. The package should be flagged and further investigated before use."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security threats. The obfuscated function name is superficial and does not indicate malicious activity. Scores reflect a very low security risk, with the malware score at 0 and a moderate obfuscation score (~0.3-0.7). Overall, the code poses no threat."
