  "purpose": "Simple function that prints 'Hello, World!'",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output channels other than the print statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to any sink; the function just prints static text.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears intentionally obfuscated, but the code itself is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function with an obfuscated name that outputs a static greeting message. There are no input sources, no external data handling, and no complex logic. The obfuscated function name could be a technique to hide purpose, but the implementation itself is innocuous. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated function that outputs a greeting. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
