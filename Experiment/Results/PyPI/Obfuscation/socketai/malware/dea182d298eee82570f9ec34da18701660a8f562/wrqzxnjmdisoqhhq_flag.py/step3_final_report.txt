  "purpose": "A trivial Python function that prints 'Hello, World!' with an obfuscated function name.",
  "sources": "Function definition, specifically the function name and the print statement.",
  "sinks": "The print statement, which outputs to standard output; no untrusted data sources or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Function name (source) to function invocation (sink), but no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Long, nonsensical function name suggesting obfuscation; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, benign function that outputs a message. The function name appears obfuscated but does not impact security. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious operations are present. The obfuscation score is justified by the function name's complexity, but the overall behavior remains harmless. Malware and security risk scores are appropriately low. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security threats. The obfuscated function name is superficial and does not indicate malicious activity. Scores reflect a very low security risk, with the malware score at 0 and a moderate obfuscation score (~0.3-0.7). Overall, the code poses no threat.",
