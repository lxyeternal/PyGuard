{
  "purpose": "The code provides terminal styling, banner display, and animation utilities, primarily for aesthetic CLI effects and user interface enhancements.",
  "sources": "User input via input(), terminal size functions, system commands (_system()), stdout writes.",
  "sinks": "System commands for window title and clear, stdout output, user prompts, string manipulations for display.",
  "flows": "User input influences display and control flow; terminal size info affects layout; system commands are invoked with dynamic parameters based on platform.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names, complex string and control flow, placeholder functions with no operational logic, use of input() without sanitization, and minimal system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of terminal UI utilities, including styled banners, animated effects, cursor control, and text styling. No network activity, data exfiltration, reverse shells, or malicious payloads are evident. Obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious. The use of input() and system commands could pose risks if misused in broader contexts, but in this isolated snippet, no malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a terminal styling and animation utility library with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low.",
