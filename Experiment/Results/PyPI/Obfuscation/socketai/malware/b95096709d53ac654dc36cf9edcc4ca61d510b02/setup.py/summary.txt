  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation, performs covert network communication, and manipulates system and file info during setup, strongly indicating malicious or backdoor behavior. The suspicious DNS queries, external IP fetches, and file operations justify high malware (≈0.8), obfuscation (≈0.9), and security risk scores (≈0.85). It should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious, warranting further investigation or removal."
