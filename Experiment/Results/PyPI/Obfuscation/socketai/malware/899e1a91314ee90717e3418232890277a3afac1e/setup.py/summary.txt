  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to obfuscated, stealthy remote command execution triggered conditionally. The pattern aligns with malware tactics such as remote payload download, backdoor setup, or data exfiltration. The high scores in reports are justified; the package should be flagged for further analysis or avoided until decoded payloads are verified."
