{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be setting up a Python package distribution, with additional code that attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existence of the 'tahg' directory and executes a PowerShell command via subprocess if the directory does not exist.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command that could be used to run arbitrary code or perform malicious actions on the host system.",
  "flows": "The script checks for 'tahg' directory → if not found, executes PowerShell command via subprocess → potentially runs malicious payload.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Base64-encoded PowerShell command in subprocess.Popen with hidden window style; no clear purpose for this command within a standard setup script; broad exception handling suppresses errors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'distutils.core.setup' for package setup, which is normal. It then attempts to import 'subprocess' and 'os'. It checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists. If not, it executes a PowerShell command that is Base64-encoded, likely obfuscated. The command is run with the window hidden and without creating a window, suggesting stealth. The command's purpose is unclear but suspicious due to obfuscation. The setup function defines package metadata. Exception handling is broad, suppressing errors. Overall, the code attempts to execute potentially malicious PowerShell code during setup, which is a supply chain risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, which is suspicious. This suggests malicious intent to run arbitrary code stealthily, indicating a high security risk. The overall behavior is potentially malicious, with obfuscated code and system manipulation during installation.",
