  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious supply chain activity, including stealthy, obfuscated PowerShell execution during setup. The high obfuscation, conditional stealth execution, and error suppression strongly suggest malicious intent. While decoding the command would provide definitive confirmation, the current evidence justifies a high malware and risk assessment."
