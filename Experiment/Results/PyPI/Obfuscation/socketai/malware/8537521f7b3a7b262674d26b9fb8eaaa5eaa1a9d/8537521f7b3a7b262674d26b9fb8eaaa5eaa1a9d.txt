      "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with dynamic configuration and version loading. The primary concern is the use of exec() on a local file, which is acceptable if the file is trusted. No malicious or obfuscated activity is detected. The security risk is low, and the malware score is 0. The overall assessment indicates a safe, typical packaging script with a minor caution regarding the trustworthiness of '_version.py'."

      "conclusion": "The code is intended for automation tasks and does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is the insecure handling of secrets, which could be exploited if misused. The malware score should remain at 0, and the risk score is justified around 0.6 due to the insecure secrets."

The scores assigned across the reports are consistent and appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low risk score of approximately 0.2. No modifications or escalations are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for testing SSH and command execution functionalities. It poses no supply chain or malicious threat. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, primarily due to the hardcoded sudo password, which is acceptable in a controlled test environment."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits insecure handling of secrets and connection configurations, which could be exploited if misused, but does not contain active malware. The high risk scores are justified, and the malware scores should remain low. Overall, the code's security posture is poor due to embedded secrets, but no malicious payloads are detected."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code does not show active malicious behavior but employs risky patterns such as executing external code and obfuscation. The primary security concern is the integrity of '_version.py'. No evidence of malware or malicious payloads is present. The obfuscation and exec() pattern justify a moderate security alert, emphasizing the need to verify the version file's trustworthiness."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behaviors like remote file manipulation and heavy obfuscation, which could be exploited maliciously. However, no explicit malicious payloads are present. The overall malware likelihood is moderate, with a high obfuscation level and remote operations raising concern. The security risk is moderate to high, warranting cautious review before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and complex data flows involving socket assertions and threading, indicating potential covert or malicious intent. However, no direct malicious payload is confirmed. The suspicious patterns justify a moderate malware and security risk score, with high obfuscation. Further analysis is recommended before deployment."
