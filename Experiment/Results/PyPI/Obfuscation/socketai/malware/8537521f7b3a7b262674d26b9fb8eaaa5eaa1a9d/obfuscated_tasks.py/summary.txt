  "conclusion": "The code exhibits insecure handling of secrets and connection configurations, which could be exploited if misused, but does not contain active malware. The high risk scores are justified, and the malware scores should remain low. Overall, the code's security posture is poor due to embedded secrets, but no malicious payloads are detected."
