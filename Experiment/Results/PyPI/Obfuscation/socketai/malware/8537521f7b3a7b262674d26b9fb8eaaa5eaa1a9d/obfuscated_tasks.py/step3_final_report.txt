  "purpose": "The code manages build, release, and deployment tasks, utilizing environment variables, imported modules, and credentials for remote connections.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, hardcoded credentials in connection setup, imported modules, and parameters.",
  "sinks": "Fabric connection objects, assertions on connection attributes, environment variables, and subprocess commands.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables and parameters into connection configuration and control flow; hardcoded secrets directly embedded into connection setup.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials ('password'='sikrit', 'user'='admin', 'gateway'='some-gateway', port='2222'), assertions verifying connection parameters, suspicious import names, and use of environment variables for flow control.",
  "analysis": "The code contains embedded secrets and credentials used directly in connection setup, which pose security risks. Assertions on sensitive connection attributes could be exploited if assertions are disabled or manipulated. No active malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or system damage are detected. The obfuscated variable names and import names suggest some obfuscation but are not malicious. The high security risk score (around 0.75) is justified due to embedded secrets and insecure practices. The malware score remains low (0) as no malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation score (~0.3) reflects some variable name obfuscation but no advanced obfuscation techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits insecure handling of secrets and connection configurations, which could be exploited if misused, but does not contain active malware. The high risk scores are justified, and the malware scores should remain low. Overall, the code's security posture is poor due to embedded secrets, but no malicious payloads are detected.",
