  "purpose": "The code automates build, testing, release, and deployment tasks for a Python project, primarily using the Invoke library. It does not contain malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, hardcoded secrets (e.g., 'sikrit', 'mypass', 'some-gateway', 'admin', 'password', 'user'), sys.path modifications, configuration objects.",
  "sinks": "Shell commands (c.run()), environment variable settings, connection configurations, module imports.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded secrets and environment variables influence command execution and connection setup; secrets flow into environment and connection configurations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials ('sikrit', 'mypass', 'some-gateway', 'admin', 'password', 'user'), sys.path modifications, environment variable manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs build and deployment automation with insecure practices such as hardcoded secrets and environment modifications. No active malicious code, payloads, or obfuscation are present. The secrets could be exploited if the code is shared or compromised, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended for automation tasks and does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is the insecure handling of secrets, which could be exploited if misused. The malware score should remain at 0, and the risk score is justified around 0.6 due to the insecure secrets.",
