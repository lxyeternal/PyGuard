  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with dynamic configuration and version loading. The primary concern is the use of exec() on a local file, which is acceptable if the file is trusted. No malicious or obfuscated activity is detected. The security risk is low, and the malware score is 0. The overall assessment indicates a safe, typical packaging script with a minor caution regarding the trustworthiness of '_version.py'."
