{
  "purpose": "This code is used to set up a Python package called 'fabrice', determining package names based on environment variables and directory structure, reading version info, and configuring package installation details.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', reading '_version.py' for version info, reading 'README.rst' for long description",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'exec' on '_version.py', reading 'README.rst', passing dependencies to setuptools.setup()",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks influence package name and binary selection, which then flow into 'setuptools.setup' configuration",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of 'exec' is standard here for version reading, not obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically determines package names based on environment variables and directory structure, then reads version information from a '_version.py' file. It reads the README file for long description and specifies dependencies. It finally calls 'setuptools.setup' with these parameters. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Use of 'exec' is typical in setup scripts to load version info. No obfuscation or hidden code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It dynamically configures package parameters based on the environment and directory state, which is common practice.",
