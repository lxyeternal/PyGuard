  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code configures a Python package, with dynamic naming based on environment variables and directory checks. It reads version info via `exec()` from `_version.py`.\n- **Findings:** The primary concern is the use of `exec()` to execute `_version.py`. If that file is compromised or malicious, it could execute arbitrary code.\n- **Risk assessment:** The report assigns a malware score of 0, reasoning that the code appears standard and no malicious behavior is evident. Given that `exec()` can execute malicious code if `_version.py` is compromised, this is a potential risk but not necessarily malicious in itself.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8; the concern about `exec()` is valid, but if the file is trusted, the risk is minimal.\n- **Verdict:** The code is typical for setup scripts; the main concern is trusting the `_version.py` file.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on dynamic configuration and reading version info via `exec()`.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code or malicious behavior; `exec()` is standard in setup scripts.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score 0, consistent with the lack of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9; very high confidence that the code is benign.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious activity detected; standard setup script.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—dynamic configuration, reading version via `exec()`.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code or network activity; `exec()` is used on local files.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score 0, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Standard, benign setup script.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar logic; dynamic naming, reading version info via `exec()`.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code or network activity; `exec()` is common for version loading.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—dynamic configuration, reading version info via `exec()`.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Standard setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is a typical setup script with dynamic configuration based on environment and filesystem state.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious intent, network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- **Use of `exec()`:** While `exec()` can be dangerous if `_version.py` is compromised, this is a common pattern in setup scripts assuming the source is trusted. The reports correctly identify this as a potential risk but not necessarily malicious.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risks:** Very low; primarily hinges on trusting the `_version.py` file.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0**, assuming the source `_version.py` is trusted.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains **0**.\n- The **risk score** should be **low (~0.1)**, reflecting the minimal risk aside from the `exec()` concern, which is a standard practice but warrants caution if the file source is untrusted.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (standard setup with a known `exec()` pattern, assuming trusted source files)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, legitimate Python package setup script with a common pattern of dynamic configuration and version loading. The main point of caution is the use of `exec()` on local files, which should be trusted. No malicious or obfuscated activity is evident.",
