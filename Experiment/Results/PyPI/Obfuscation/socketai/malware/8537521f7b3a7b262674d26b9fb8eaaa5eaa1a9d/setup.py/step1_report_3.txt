{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically determines package configuration and sets up a Python package for distribution, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2'), filesystem directories ('fabric2', 'fabric'), files ('_version.py', 'README.rst'), and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Uses the gathered data in setuptools.setup() to define package installation, entry points, and dependencies; no untrusted data is directly executed or written.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and filesystem checks influence package names and binaries, which are then used in the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. exec() is used to read version info but on a local file, which is standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment checks and filesystem verification to determine package configuration dynamically. It reads version info via exec() from a local '_version.py' file, which is a common practice. No user input or untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks. The setup() function configures package metadata, dependencies, and entry points without executing or including any code from external or untrusted sources. No obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured setup script with dynamic configuration logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup script for package distribution. It dynamically configures package parameters based on environment variables and filesystem state but does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use.",
