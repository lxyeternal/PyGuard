  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with environment-dependent naming and version extraction.\n- The primary potential security concern is the use of `exec()` to read `_version.py`.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, with the `exec()` call being a common pattern, assuming the version file is trusted.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the purpose and sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes that `exec()` is a potential risk but notes it's standard in setup scripts.\n- **Anomalies:** Correctly points out the `exec()` usage as a risk if `_version.py` is compromised.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Reasonable; the risk is minimal if `_version.py` is trusted.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The risk score could be slightly higher (e.g., 0.3) if considering that executing an external file always carries some risk, but given the context, 0.2 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes `exec()` as standard but notes the risk.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity; the code is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; safe for use.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. The low security risk score aligns with the reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- Similar to previous, emphasizes standard setup process, with `exec()` being typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- Same reasoning; no malicious activity, standard practice.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- Same conclusion; the use of `exec()` is common in setup scripts.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. No malicious code, network activity, or backdoors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the reliance on `exec()` to load version info, a small risk exists if `_version.py` is compromised, but in a trusted environment, this is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious intent or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — the only concern is the use of `exec()` on a local file, which is standard but can be risky if the file is untrusted.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.1   |\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard setup script with minimal security concerns. The use of `exec()` to load version info is common but should be trusted. No malicious or obfuscated code is present, and the overall security risk is low.",
