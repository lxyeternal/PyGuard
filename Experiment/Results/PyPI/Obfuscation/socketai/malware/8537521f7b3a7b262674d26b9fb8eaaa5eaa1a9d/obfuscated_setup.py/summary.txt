  "conclusion": "The code does not show active malicious behavior but employs risky patterns such as executing external code and obfuscation. The primary security concern is the integrity of '_version.py'. No evidence of malware or malicious payloads is present. The obfuscation and exec() pattern justify a moderate security alert, emphasizing the need to verify the version file's trustworthiness."
