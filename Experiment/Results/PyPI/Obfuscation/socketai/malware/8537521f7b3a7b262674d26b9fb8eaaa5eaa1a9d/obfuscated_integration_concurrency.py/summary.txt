  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and complex data flows involving socket assertions and threading, indicating potential covert or malicious intent. However, no direct malicious payload is confirmed. The suspicious patterns justify a moderate malware and security risk score, with high obfuscation. Further analysis is recommended before deployment."
