  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution triggered conditionally. The use of encoded commands, hidden window, and silent error handling are classic indicators of malicious payload delivery. Overall, the code should be considered high risk and potentially malicious."
