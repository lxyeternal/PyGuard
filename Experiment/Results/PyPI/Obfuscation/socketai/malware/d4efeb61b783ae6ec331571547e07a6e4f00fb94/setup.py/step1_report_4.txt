{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package, but also attempts to execute hidden PowerShell commands, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading the filesystem with 'os.path.exists'; executing subprocess with a PowerShell encoded command.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing a hidden PowerShell command; potential for data exfiltration or remote code execution.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code runs a hidden PowerShell command, which is potentially malicious. The setup call is benign and unrelated.",
  "anomalies": "The embedded PowerShell command is encoded and executed with no clear purpose; use of try-except blocks obscures failures; the command likely fetches or executes remote payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and tries to import subprocess and os modules. It checks for a directory named 'tahg'. If absent, it runs a subprocess with a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64. This command appears designed to perform remote or hidden operations, possibly downloading or executing malicious code. The setup() call is standard but is wrapped in a try-except, indicating potential obfuscation or attempts to hide failures. Overall, the presence of an encoded PowerShell command executed in a hidden window suggests malicious intent or at least suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a hidden PowerShell command executed silently, which is highly suspicious. The setup code itself appears benign but is likely a distraction or part of the malicious payload. Overall, this package shows signs of malicious behavior, especially the obfuscated command execution.",
