  "conclusion": "The code does not contain active malicious payloads but performs suspicious external notification signaling installation with misleading content. The obfuscation and message referencing 'reverse_shell' strongly suggest malicious intent or at least deceptive behavior. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified, with a malware score around 0.7, obfuscation at 0.8, and security risk at 0.75. The package warrants caution and further review due to its potential for covert malicious signaling."
