  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Issue Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines a setup for a Python package with minimal dependencies.\n   - During execution (`if __name__ == '__main__'`), it calls `dipOQmmnaZRjYuhXaOCLCZWFZLMJsTow()`.\n   - This function constructs a hardcoded Discord webhook URL and sends a message: `'¡Alguien ha instalado el paquete reverse_shell!'`.\n   - The function name and message are obfuscated, which is suspicious.\n   - The message content explicitly references a \"reverse_shell,\" suggesting malicious intent or at least deceptive behavior.\n   - No other malicious actions (like code execution, data exfiltration, or system modification) are evident beyond the notification.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the obfuscation, the use of a webhook, and the suspicious message content.\n   - They also note the minimal setup and the fact that the notification occurs during installation or execution.\n   - No significant logical flaws are present in the reports; they are consistent with the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given & Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign high malware scores (~0.6–0.8), which is justified given the message referencing a reverse shell and the webhook notification.\n   - Security risk scores are also high (~0.6–0.8), which is reasonable considering the covert notification mechanism.\n   - Obfuscation scores (~0.7–0.8) are appropriate.\n   - The malware scores are consistent with the suspicion of malicious intent based on message content and obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk/Malware Scores:**\n   - The message \"¡Alguien ha instalado el paquete reverse_shell!\" explicitly suggests malicious activity or at least the potential for malicious use.\n   - The use of a webhook for notification during installation is a common tactic in malicious packages to report or control installations covertly.\n   - Obfuscation further indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent.\n   - These factors justify a malware score of 0.8 and a security risk score of at least 0.75.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions & Claims:**\n   - The reports assume malicious intent based on message content and obfuscation, which is reasonable.\n   - No evidence suggests the package performs destructive actions or exfiltrates data directly.\n   - However, the presence of a webhook notification with a message referencing a reverse shell is highly suspicious and often associated with malicious activity.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n   - The high malware and security risk scores are justified.\n\n7. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any actual reverse shell or malicious payload.\n   - The notification mechanism could be used for malicious purposes or simply for tracking.\n   - Given the context and message content, the risk should be considered high.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0.8** (due to the message referencing a reverse shell, obfuscation, and external notification)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.8** (function name and message are obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.75** (high, due to covert notification, suspicious message, and obfuscation)\n\n**In conclusion**, this package appears to be designed for malicious or at least suspicious purposes, primarily through covert notification of installation. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable, and the evidence supports a high security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If you were to assign scores independently, you might consider a malware score of 0.8 and a risk score of 0.75, aligning with the reports' assessments.",
