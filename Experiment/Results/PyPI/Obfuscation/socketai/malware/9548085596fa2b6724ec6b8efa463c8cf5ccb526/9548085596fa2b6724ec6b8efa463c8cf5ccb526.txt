      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code does not contain active malicious payloads but performs suspicious external notification signaling installation with misleading content. The obfuscation and message referencing 'reverse_shell' strongly suggest malicious intent or at least deceptive behavior. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified, with a malware score around 0.7, obfuscation at 0.8, and security risk at 0.75. The package warrants caution and further review due to its potential for covert malicious signaling."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high levels of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network activity typical of malware or backdoors. Given the behaviors and patterns, it is highly likely malicious, with a malware score close to 1, obfuscation level around 0.9, and security risk near 1.0."

      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious malware designed for data theft, surveillance, and remote control. It exhibits high obfuscation but the malicious activities are clear and active. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, with malware and security risk scores at maximum levels. The obfuscation score is appropriate given the variable naming and distracting elements. Overall, this code should be classified as high-severity malware with a very high security threat."
