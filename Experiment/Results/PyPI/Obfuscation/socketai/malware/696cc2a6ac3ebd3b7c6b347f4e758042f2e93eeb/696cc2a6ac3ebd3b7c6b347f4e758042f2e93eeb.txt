      "confidence": 1,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through obfuscated remote code execution during package installation. The use of base64 encoding, external URL fetches, and execution of remote scripts confirms malicious intent with high confidence. The scores are consistent with this assessment, indicating a high security threat."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code in Reports 1-3 appears benign with low risk; Reports 4 and 5 demonstrate behaviors—dynamic execution, obfuscation—that elevate potential security concerns. Scores are generally appropriate; slight adjustments reflect the suspicion in Reports 4 and 5. Overall, moderate risk and malware scores are justified given the patterns observed, but no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed. Further review is recommended if more code is available."

      "conclusion": "The most comprehensive and balanced report (Report 3) effectively highlights suspicious dynamic features and obfuscation, assigning appropriate scores. The overall risk and malware levels are low to moderate, with no definitive malicious payloads observed. The assessments are justified, and the scores are consistent with the evidence. Minor score adjustments could improve accuracy, but current evaluations are reasonable."
