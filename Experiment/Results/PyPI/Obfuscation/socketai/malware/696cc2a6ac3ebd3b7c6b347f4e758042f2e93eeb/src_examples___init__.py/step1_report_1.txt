  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided in the input; the code appears to be a blank or empty file with no functional content.",
  "sources": "No data sources or input mechanisms are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or sensitive operations are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are detectable due to the absence of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is completely empty, with no functions, variables, or logic; this is unusual and might indicate an incomplete or placeholder file.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is an empty file with no executable content or structure. There are no data sources, no sinks, no flows, and no suspicious or malicious patterns. Without additional context or code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The absence of code itself is not suspicious but suggests the file may be a placeholder or incomplete.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current content, there are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The file appears benign but incomplete.",
