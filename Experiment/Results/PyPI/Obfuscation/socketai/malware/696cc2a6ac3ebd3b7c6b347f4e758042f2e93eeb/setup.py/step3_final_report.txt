{
  "purpose": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string which, when executed, runs shell commands to download and execute external scripts, indicating malicious behavior aimed at remote code execution during installation.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string within the 'notmalfunc' function, decoded at runtime to produce shell commands executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded shell commands that perform network requests and script execution from external URLs.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded by b64d(), then passed to os.system, which runs the commands that fetch and execute remote scripts.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate shell commands, execution of external scripts during package installation, delays and print statements that mask malicious activity, and the inclusion of potentially malicious URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a function 'notmalfunc' that decodes a base64 string which, when executed, runs shell commands involving network requests to external URLs and script execution. The obfuscation via base64 and the execution during setup are suspicious. The decoded commands include 'curl' and 'python' invocations to fetch and run scripts from a remote source, indicating an attempt to compromise the system or perform malicious activities. The use of sleep and print statements appears to mask or delay malicious actions, but the core behavior is malicious. The overall structure suggests an intent to execute remote code during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The malware score is set to 1 due to the high likelihood of malicious intent, and the security risk score is also 1, reflecting the severe threat posed by executing external scripts during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through obfuscated remote code execution during package installation. The use of base64 encoding, external URL fetches, and execution of remote scripts confirms malicious intent with high confidence. The scores are consistent with this assessment, indicating a high security threat.",
