{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'mordving' that includes custom install and develop commands, with an obfuscated function that appears to execute decoded shell commands.",
  "sources": "Import statements, b64d function decoding base64 string, notmalfunc() function executing os.system with decoded command, run method of AfterInstall class calling notmalfunc()",
  "sinks": "os.system in notmalfunc() potentially executing decoded commands, print statements, use of sleep functions (not inherently malicious)",
  "flows": "Code decodes base64 string -> executes decoded shell commands via os.system in notmalfunc() during installation -> outputs progress messages",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded string in notmalfunc() suggesting obfuscation, execution of system commands via os.system with decoded code, code runs during installation which could be malicious or unwanted",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools modules and defines a function to decode base64-encoded code. The notmalfunc() function decodes a base64 string that, when decoded, appears to be a shell command executing 'curl' to download and run a script from a remote URL, which is a common tactic in malicious package behavior. The function is called during the installation process via the AfterInstall class, meaning the command executes during package install. This behavior could lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. Other parts of the code are standard setup procedures, but the embedded obfuscated command raises significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated base64-encoded shell commands executed during installation, indicating malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The decoded command appears designed to fetch and execute remote code, which poses a high security risk.",
