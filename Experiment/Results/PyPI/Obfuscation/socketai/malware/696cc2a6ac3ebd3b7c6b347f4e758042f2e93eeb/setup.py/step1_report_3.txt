{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package with custom install behavior that executes additional code after installation.",
  "sources": "Base64 encoded string in 'notmalfunc' function, environment variables (potentially via os.system), package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded base64 string, print statements, sleep functions, package installation commands.",
  "flows": "The decoded base64 command is executed via os.system during package installation, potentially running malicious code embedded in the base64 string.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a base64-encoded payload that, when decoded and executed via os.system, runs a complex shell command. The payload appears to download or interact with external resources. The presence of sleep delays and obfuscated execution suggests intent to hide or delay malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines a helper function to decode base64 strings. The core concern is the 'notmalfunc' function, which decodes a base64 string that, when executed via os.system, runs a shell command. The decoded command appears to download and run scripts from external URLs, which could be malicious. The setup class hooks into post-install events to invoke 'notmalfunc', meaning this code executes upon package installation. No other suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are evident outside the obfuscated payload. The usage of base64 encoding and os.system suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. Overall, the code's primary suspicious aspect is the embedded payload designed to run external commands during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a concealed payload that executes external commands during package installation, indicating malicious intent. The obfuscation and execution of decoded base64 commands are suspicious and likely malicious. This package should be considered dangerous until further analysis confirms safety.",
