{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'mordving' that performs custom actions during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from a base64-encoded string within the 'notmalfunc' function.",
  "sinks": "The decoded base64 string executes shell commands via os.system, which could run arbitrary commands if the base64 data is manipulated or replaced.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string decodes into shell commands executed through os.system, potentially executing malicious code if the string is compromised.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded shell commands that are decoded and executed dynamically; this obfuscation could hide malicious intent. No other suspicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines a function 'b64d' to decode base64 strings. The 'notmalfunc' function decodes a base64 string which, when decoded, contains shell commands that perform network requests, file operations, and other system commands. These commands are executed via os.system, which is a security risk. The setup process hooks into 'install' and 'develop' commands, executing 'notmalfunc' during installation. The decoded commands appear to be obfuscated, and executing arbitrary shell commands at install time raises concerns. However, the actual base64 string decodes to commands that seem to perform network requests and file operations; without execution, it's hard to confirm maliciousness, but the obfuscation and dynamic execution are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated base64-encoded shell commands executed during package installation, which could be malicious or maliciously disguised. The use of dynamic decoding and execution without transparency warrants suspicion. The overall risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and execution of decoded code at install time.",
