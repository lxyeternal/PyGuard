{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that installs a package named 'mordving' and executes a suspicious function during installation.",
  "sources": "The 'notmalfunc()' function, called during the installation process, reads a base64-encoded string which, when decoded, executes a Python script via 'os.system'.",
  "sinks": "The decoded base64 code is executed through 'os.system', which can run arbitrary shell commands, potentially leading to malicious actions or system compromise.",
  "flows": "The code decodes base64-encoded payload and executes it via 'os.system', which can lead to remote code execution or other malicious activity during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The 'notmalfunc()' function contains a base64-encoded payload that decodes into a command executing potentially malicious scripts. The payload appears obfuscated intentionally, indicating suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools modules and defines helper functions. The key concern is 'notmalfunc()', which decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it via 'os.system'. The encoded string, once decoded, runs a Python script that fetches code from a URL and executes it, which could be malicious. This payload is invoked during package installation ('AfterInstall.run'), which is unusual and suspicious. No other malicious code or backdoors are evident outside this payload. The rest of the setup code appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious payload embedded as an encoded string that executes arbitrary commands during installation. This behavior indicates malicious intent, likely aiming to run unauthorized code or compromise the host system. The rest of the script is standard setup boilerplate.",
