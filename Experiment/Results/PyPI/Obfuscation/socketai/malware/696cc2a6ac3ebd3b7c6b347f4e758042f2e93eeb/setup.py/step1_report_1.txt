{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a Python package setup process with custom installation behavior, including a function that executes obfuscated code, potentially to perform malicious activities during installation.",
  "sources": "The function 'notmalfunc' reads a base64-encoded string, which when decoded executes system commands via os.system. The setup script reads no other external data directly.",
  "sinks": "os.system is called with decoded code, which executes shell commands. This is the main sink where untrusted or malicious code could be executed.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded by b64d, then passed to os.system in 'notmalfunc', executing arbitrary shell commands during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'notmalfunc' contains obfuscated base64-encoded code that, when decoded, executes commands that appear to download and run scripts from external URLs, possibly malicious. It also has sleep delays and prints that simulate progress but may mask malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Python package with custom install commands. The 'notmalfunc' function decodes and executes a base64-encoded string that, upon inspection, decompresses to a shell command chain downloading and executing scripts from a URL (https://github.com/Etet75/neofetch/). This behavior indicates an attempt to fetch and run potentially malicious code during installation. The use of base64 encoding and obfuscated strings suggests an effort to hide malicious intent. The setup script’s structure itself is standard, but the embedded decoded command is suspicious and likely malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes a hidden malicious payload that downloads and executes external scripts during installation, posing a high security risk. The obfuscation and network activity strongly indicate malicious intent, possibly to compromise systems installing this package.",
