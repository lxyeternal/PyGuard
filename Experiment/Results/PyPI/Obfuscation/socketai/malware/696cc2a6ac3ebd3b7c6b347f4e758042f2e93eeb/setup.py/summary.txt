  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through obfuscated remote code execution during package installation. The use of base64 encoding, external URL fetches, and execution of remote scripts confirms malicious intent with high confidence. The scores are consistent with this assessment, indicating a high security threat."
