  "conclusion": "The code in Reports 1-3 appears benign with low risk; Reports 4 and 5 demonstrate behaviors—dynamic execution, obfuscation—that elevate potential security concerns. Scores are generally appropriate; slight adjustments reflect the suspicion in Reports 4 and 5. Overall, moderate risk and malware scores are justified given the patterns observed, but no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed. Further review is recommended if more code is available."
