  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and descriptions.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, command-line arguments, files, network sockets, user input, and dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variables, system commands, and potential data leaks or code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, user input, files) to sinks (network, file system, system commands), possibly via eval/exec or insecure network communication.",
  "anomalies": "Potential dynamic code execution (eval/exec), reading untrusted input without validation, and network activity that could be suspicious if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform typical data processing or setup tasks with no explicit malicious activity. No obfuscation or backdoors are evident. The use of eval/exec or network sockets is noted but not confirmed as malicious. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with cautious but justified assessment. The absence of code snippets limits definitive conclusions, but based on descriptions, the overall security posture is low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects cautious awareness of potential dynamic code or network concerns, but no evidence supports higher threat levels. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. Overall, the dependency appears benign.",
