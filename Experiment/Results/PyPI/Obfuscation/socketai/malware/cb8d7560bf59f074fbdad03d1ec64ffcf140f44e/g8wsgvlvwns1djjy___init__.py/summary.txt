  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects cautious awareness of potential dynamic code or network concerns, but no evidence supports higher threat levels. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. Overall, the dependency appears benign."
