  "purpose": "Defines an obfuscated class inheriting from another class with a static string attribute, likely serving as a placeholder or configuration.",
  "sources": "Class inheritance and static attribute assignment",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names; no methods or data flow; static string attribute",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class with obfuscated naming, inheriting from an external class, containing only a static string attribute. No methods, data input/output, or dynamic behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the obfuscation and lack of malicious activity. Malware scores are zero, risk scores are very low, and confidence levels are high, reflecting the benign and static nature of the code. The obfuscation is consistent but does not imply malicious intent in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, obfuscated but non-operational, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
