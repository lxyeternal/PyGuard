  "purpose": "Load JSON files from a directory, dynamically import a converter module based on filename, and apply a transformation function to each data set.",
  "sources": "JSON files read from the specified directory; module filename derived from user input; dynamic import of module based on filename.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of transformation function on loaded data; dynamic import potentially executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Read JSON files -> import module dynamically based on filename -> call transformation function with loaded data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; undefined variable 'module_name'; references to an undefined exception class; dynamic import without validation; incomplete or buggy code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code loads JSON files and performs data transformation via a dynamically imported module. The use of an undefined 'module_name' and an undefined exception class indicates incomplete or intentionally obfuscated code. The dynamic import based on user-controlled filenames presents a security risk, as malicious modules could be executed if supplied. No explicit malicious actions such as network activity or system modification are evident, but the pattern of dynamic import without validation is a common supply chain vulnerability. Obfuscation and code quality issues further increase suspicion. The malware score is low (around 0.2-0.4), reflecting the absence of active malicious code but acknowledging the potential for exploitation. The security risk score is moderate (~0.6), considering the unvalidated dynamic import and incomplete code. Obfuscation scores are high (~0.7), justified by variable naming and code structure. Overall, the code is a data processing harness with notable security concerns primarily due to dynamic import and obfuscation, but no confirmed malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a data transformation testing harness with significant security vulnerabilities stemming from dynamic module import without validation and obfuscated code structure. While no active malware is present, the potential for malicious module execution exists if inputs are malicious. The scores should reflect a moderate to high security risk primarily due to these factors. Recommended actions include validating module paths, sanitizing inputs, and removing obfuscation to mitigate risks.",
