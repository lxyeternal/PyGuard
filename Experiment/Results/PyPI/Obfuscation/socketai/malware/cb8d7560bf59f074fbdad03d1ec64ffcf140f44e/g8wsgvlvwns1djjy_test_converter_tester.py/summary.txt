  "conclusion": "The script is a data transformation testing harness with significant security vulnerabilities stemming from dynamic module import without validation and obfuscated code structure. While no active malware is present, the potential for malicious module execution exists if inputs are malicious. The scores should reflect a moderate to high security risk primarily due to these factors. Recommended actions include validating module paths, sanitizing inputs, and removing obfuscation to mitigate risks."
