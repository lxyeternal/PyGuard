  "purpose": "This code module imports classes and functions with obfuscated names from local modules and exposes them via an __all__ list for public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data flows; no external data input or output present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only import and export of symbols within the module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or randomly generated identifiers for imported symbols; no active code or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports various classes/functions with obfuscated names and defines an __all__ list to specify public symbols. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leaks, or system modifications. The obfuscation of identifiers could be for code protection or concealment but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The low malware scores (0 or 0.1) and low security risk scores (around 0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The high obfuscation score (around 0.7-0.8) reflects the obscured naming but does not confirm maliciousness. Overall, the code appears to be a typical import/export module with obfuscated names, warranting caution but not immediate concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that imports classes/functions with obfuscated identifiers and exposes them via __all__. No active malicious activity or security risks are evident within this snippet. The obfuscation warrants further review of the imported modules, but based solely on this code, there is no indication of malicious intent.",
