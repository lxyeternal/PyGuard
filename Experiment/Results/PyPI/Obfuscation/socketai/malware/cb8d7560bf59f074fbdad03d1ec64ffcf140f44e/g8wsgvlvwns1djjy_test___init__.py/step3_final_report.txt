  "purpose": "Import specific functions or identifiers from a local module and define the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .converter_tester module, importing obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated identifiers for imported entities; minimal code structure with no usage of imported names.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two identifiers with obfuscated names from a local module, which is suspicious as it may conceal malicious code. The __all__ list exposes functions with clear names, but the imported identifiers are not used within this snippet. The minimal nature of the code limits assessment, but the obfuscation alone warrants caution. No malicious activity or data leaks are evident, but the obfuscated import names could be a concealment tactic. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.2, obfuscated ~0.75, risk ~0.4) are consistent with the suspicion level. Further review of the actual implementations in 'converter_tester' is recommended to confirm safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet shows minimal, obfuscated imports that could be used to hide malicious code, but no direct evidence of malicious activity is present. The obfuscation raises suspicion, and further analysis of the imported functions is necessary. Overall, the risk is moderate, with low likelihood of malware based solely on this snippet.",
