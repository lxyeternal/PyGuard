  "conclusion": "The code snippet shows minimal, obfuscated imports that could be used to hide malicious code, but no direct evidence of malicious activity is present. The obfuscation raises suspicion, and further analysis of the imported functions is necessary. Overall, the risk is moderate, with low likelihood of malware based solely on this snippet."
