  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific functions from a local module for external use",
  "sources": "Import statement importing potentially obfuscated identifiers from a relative module",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simply imports and __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers have non-descriptive, obfuscated names which may indicate hidden functionality or attempt to conceal malicious intent; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions with non-descriptive, obfuscated names from a local module. The use of obfuscated names could be an attempt to hide malicious functionality or conceal the true purpose of these functions. The module then declares an __all__ list exposing two explicitly named functions, which appear benign. The code itself is minimal, providing no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscation warrants caution as it could hide malicious code within the imported functions. No other suspicious code, external network calls, or data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary suspicious aspect is the use of obfuscated identifiers in the import statement, which could conceal malicious or unintended functionality. The overall structure is simple, but the obfuscation justifies a cautious security review of the imported functions' implementations.",
