  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions or classes from a local module and defines the public API of the package/module.",

  "flows": "N/A; no data flow is explicitly present in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Imported entities have obfuscated or nonsensical names (WWghkSsmIXciygIEowhGhraJjueUjrWn, wMfbtsoNDlNFbrgGqFfBcEOTwhzYveXx), which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent, but may also be a coding style or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import from a relative module, importing two identifiers with seemingly nonsensical names. It then defines __all__ to specify exported symbols. The unusual naming of imported symbols warrants attention but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. There are no evident data flows, external inputs, or suspicious operations in this snippet. The code is minimal and lacks any executable logic beyond imports and __all__ declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears to be a standard module import with intentionally obfuscated names for imported identifiers. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this fragment. The obfuscated names could be a benign naming choice or an attempt at concealment, but on its own, this snippet is not malicious.",
