{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures and methods for managing parameter values, including validation and type handling, likely within a larger application context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method parameters, property accessors, and external dependencies such as imported modules and classes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include property getters and methods that process or return internal data, but none appear to execute untrusted input directly or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs and properties to internal storage (_values), with validation and type checks, then to output through properties or representation methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are evident. The code relies heavily on external dependencies and type annotations but does not contain obfuscated language features, dynamic execution, or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a strongly typed, validated parameter management system, with careful validation of input types and values. It uses property decorators, method overloading, and custom validation functions. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or file operations are present. The structure indicates a focus on data integrity rather than malicious activity. External imports are standard for type checking and data classes, and no suspicious patterns emerge. The code does not manipulate or leak data in an insecure manner.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the thorough review, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It appears to be a well-structured data management class with proper validation. No malware or security risks are identified.",
