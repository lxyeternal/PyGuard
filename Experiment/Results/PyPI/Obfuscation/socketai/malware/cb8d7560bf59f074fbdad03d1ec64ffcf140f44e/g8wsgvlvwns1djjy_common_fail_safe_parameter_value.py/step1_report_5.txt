{
  "purpose": "Defines a data class that encapsulates either a parameter value or an exception, providing properties to access underlying data.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .acquired_parameter_value, .parameter_exception, and optionally .value_header.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external data outputs; no network, file, or environment variable interactions observed.",
  "flows": "The class accesses attributes of the encapsulated object, but there are no flows involving untrusted input to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Class uses non-descriptive, obfuscated names for classes and properties. No visible hardcoded secrets, suspicious strings, or code that executes dynamically.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines an immutable data class holding a union of a value or exception, and provides property methods to access specific attributes of the contained object. The class structure appears typical for encapsulating and accessing parameter data, with no evidence of malicious code or behavior. No external data flows, no network or file operations, and no suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, obfuscated-looking data container with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger codebase, likely handling parameter validation or processing, with no evident malware or security threats.",
