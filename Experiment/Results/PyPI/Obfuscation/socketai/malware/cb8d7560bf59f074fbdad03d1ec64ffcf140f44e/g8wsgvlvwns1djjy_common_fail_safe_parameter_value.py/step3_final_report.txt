  "purpose": "A data container class encapsulating either a value or an exception, providing accessors for specific attributes.",
  "sources": "The attribute 'value_or_exception' which holds either a value object or an exception object.",
  "sinks": "The property methods accessing attributes of 'value_or_exception', such as 'NEXhzybKWAVUdNcotqkvSxKnxRnmuHWU' and 'eYRYdLNsQBpbflvIaVdNSCKoeGqTOMuQ'.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into 'value_or_exception'; properties access attributes of this object based on its type.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class and variable names; no malicious code, network activity, or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, immutable data class designed to hold either a value or an exception, with properties to access nested attributes. No suspicious behaviors, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. Obfuscation is notable but not inherently malicious. The class functions as a structural component, likely for error handling or data encapsulation, with no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated data container with no malicious activity or security risks. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and the code's simplicity suggests it is a standard component. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
