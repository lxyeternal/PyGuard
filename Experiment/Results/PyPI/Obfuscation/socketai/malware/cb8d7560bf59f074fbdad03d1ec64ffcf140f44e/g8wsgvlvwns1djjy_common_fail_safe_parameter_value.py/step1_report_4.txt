{
  "purpose": "The code defines a data class that encapsulates a value or exception, providing accessors for different properties of the contained object.",
  "sources": "Imports of modules, especially relative imports from other parts of the package; use of type hints for dynamic typing.",
  "sinks": "Accessors and property methods that read attributes from the encapsulated objects; no direct data leaks or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "The data class receives an object (either a value or an exception) and provides property accessors to retrieve specific attributes based on the type of the contained object.",
  "anomalies": "The class design appears standard; no unusual or suspicious code structures, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines a frozen data class with a single attribute 'value_or_exception' that can hold either a value object or an exception object. The properties provided simply access attributes of this contained object, with type checks ensuring correct attribute retrieval depending on the contained type. The import paths and naming conventions appear obfuscated or auto-generated, but this does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No code injections, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to serve as a structured way to encapsulate either a successful value or an exception, likely used elsewhere in the project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data container with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a simple wrapper to access attributes of either a value or exception object. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present.",
