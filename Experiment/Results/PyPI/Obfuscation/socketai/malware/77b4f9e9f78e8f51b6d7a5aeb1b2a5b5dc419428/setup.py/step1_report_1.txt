{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package with some obfuscated and encrypted behavior, possibly for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports modules such as os, requests, and fernet, and decrypts encrypted data within the 'ghXAKCZdVkhvfwjnmKOOCRVvAwWcDDef' method.",
  "sinks": "Decrypted code executed via exec(), network requests via requests module, and potential use of environment variables or imported modules for malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code conditionally decrypts a payload using Fernet and executes it if the OS is Windows; this occurs during the install process, representing a source-to-sink flow leading to remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, encrypted payload executed dynamically, decryption key embedded in code, and use of exec() to run decrypted code—all indicators of malicious or suspicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines an obfuscated setup process where, during installation on Windows OS, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypts a payload with a hardcoded key, and executes it via exec(). The encrypted payload is likely malicious code, as this pattern is common in supply chain attacks to execute hidden malicious routines. The use of encrypted data, dynamic execution, and obfuscated identifiers strongly suggest malicious intent. No legitimate package functions are evident beyond setup configuration, and the encrypted code execution is a major red flag.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, encrypted payload that executes during installation on Windows, indicating malicious intent. The pattern matches known malicious behaviors such as remote code execution and obfuscation to hide malicious payloads. It should be considered highly malicious.",
