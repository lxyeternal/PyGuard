  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that dynamically executes code fetched from an external URL.",
  "sources": "Reading from a temporary file, reading from a URL via urlopen.",
  "sinks": "exec() call with remote code, system call to start an external executable.",
  "flows": "Temporary file write -> URL fetch -> exec() -> system() to run executable.",
  "anomalies": "Writes suspicious code into a temporary file, then executes a system command with the Python interpreter; code fetched from a remote URL and executed dynamically, which is highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a temporary file and writes Python code that downloads content from a specified URL and executes it via exec(), a common malicious pattern for remote code execution. Then, it runs an external executable using system(), passing the temporary file path, which can lead to executing arbitrary malicious code or binaries. The setup() call is standard but is preceded by malicious code injection steps. The overall pattern indicates malicious intent, specifically remote code execution and possible backdoor setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, involving remote code fetch and execution, which is a common malicious tactic. It should be considered unsafe and malicious.",
