{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, with an embedded payload that downloads and executes remote code.",
  "sources": "Reading from sys.executable, reading and writing to temporary files, executing system commands, fetching data from a URL using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "sinks": "exec() function with downloaded content, system() command executing the temp file.",
  "flows": "Temporary file creation (source) -> downloading remote code into the file -> executing the file via exec() (sink), system() command executing a file with the Python interpreter.",
  "anomalies": "Embedding a URL fetch and exec() within a setup script, use of random variable names, creation of a temporary file that contains remote code, executing arbitrary code fetched from external URL.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup from setuptools, then creates a temporary file and writes a payload that fetches remote code from a URL and executes it via exec(). Afterward, it runs a system command to start a process with the current Python executable. The payload's purpose appears to be malicious, as it downloads and runs code from an external source without any validation. The use of obfuscated variable names and the approach of embedding remote code execution within a setup script strongly suggest malicious intent. The overall behavior indicates an attempt to execute arbitrary code from an external server, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, as it downloads and executes code from an external source during the package setup process. It exhibits typical behaviors of supply chain malware, including remote code fetching and execution with no validation or safeguards.",
