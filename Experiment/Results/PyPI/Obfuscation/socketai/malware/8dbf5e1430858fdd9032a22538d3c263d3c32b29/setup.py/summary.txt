  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell payload during package setup, strongly indicating malicious activity. The high scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate. The package should be flagged for further analysis, including decoding and inspecting the payload, before deployment."
