{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a certain operation that involves handling data, possibly related to user input or external sources. However, the exact functionality is unclear due to obfuscated or minimal code.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, input functions, or external modules. Specific input sources are not explicitly visible due to minimal code provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or system commands, but none are explicitly shown. No clear malicious sink identified from the code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input or environment variables to processing functions or outputs. Exact paths are unclear due to limited code details.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses minimal structure, may contain obfuscated or unconventional syntax. Lack of comments, unclear variable names, or dynamic code execution could be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is minimal and does not show explicit malicious functions. The lack of detailed operations limits definitive conclusions. There are no obvious hardcoded credentials, network calls, or system modifications. The code's simplicity and minimal structure suggest it is benign, but the possibility of obfuscation or hidden intent cannot be ruled out without additional context.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or malware. The code's minimal nature limits confidence, but no immediate threats are detected. Further context is needed for a definitive assessment.",
  "confidence": 0.4,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
