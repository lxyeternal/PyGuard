  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs from environment variables, input functions, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "External network connections, file operations, dynamic code execution points such as eval/exec.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks, especially where untrusted input influences dynamic execution or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious patterns include dynamic code execution, high obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits minimal or benign patterns in most reports, with reports 1, 2, 3, and 5 showing no malicious activity and low obfuscation. Report 4 displays signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating potential malicious intent. Scores are generally aligned with the described suspicion levels, with report 4 justifiably showing higher malware (0.4) and obfuscation (0.7) scores. Considering the suspicion, increasing malware score in report 4 to 0.5 would better reflect the potential risk. Other reports' scores are appropriate given their descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, with report 4 indicating suspicious patterns warranting cautious interpretation. Adjusting report 4's malware score to 0.5 improves the risk assessment. Overall, the code's security posture is low risk, with a notable exception in report 4.",
