      "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for packaging the 'certifi' library. The obfuscation and execution of system commands are typical in such scripts but should be used cautiously. No malicious activity or backdoors are detected. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscation score is moderate due to variable naming, and the overall security risk remains low."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, version-compatible resource loader for SSL certificates, with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.2). Obfuscation is moderate (~0.6), but it does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain risk is very low."

      "obfuscated": 0.9,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and suspicious import patterns from a trusted library, indicating potential malicious intent. The dynamic invocation of undefined attributes with nonsensical names raises high suspicion of malicious behavior. Scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.7, obfuscated ~0.9, security risk ~0.75) are justified given these indicators. Further dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm malicious activity, but static evidence warrants treating this code as high risk."
