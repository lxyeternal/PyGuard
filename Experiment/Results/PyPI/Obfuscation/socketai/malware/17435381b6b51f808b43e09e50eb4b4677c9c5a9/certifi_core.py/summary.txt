  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, version-compatible resource loader for SSL certificates, with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.2). Obfuscation is moderate (~0.6), but it does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain risk is very low."
