{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the path to 'cacert.pem' from the 'certifi' package, handling different Python versions for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Code reads the 'certifi' package resources or local 'cacert.pem' file depending on Python version; uses importlib.resources or filesystem fallback.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks, network activity, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Resource location functions call 'as_file', 'files', or open local 'cacert.pem' file; no external data flow or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "Variable and function names are obfuscated, which may be superficial; no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a version-aware resource locator for 'cacert.pem' used in SSL contexts. It employs standard library functions for resource access, with obfuscation likely for concealment but not malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious modifications are present. The obfuscation is superficial, and the code's purpose is benign. All signals point to a safe, supply chain-compatible utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, version-compatible resource loader for SSL certificates, with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.2). Obfuscation is moderate (~0.6), but it does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain risk is very low.",
