  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for packaging the 'certifi' library. The obfuscation and execution of system commands are typical in such scripts but should be used cautiously. No malicious activity or backdoors are detected. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscation score is moderate due to variable naming, and the overall security risk remains low."
