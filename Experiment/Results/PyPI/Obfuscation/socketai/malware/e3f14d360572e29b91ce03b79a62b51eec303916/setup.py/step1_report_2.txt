{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package, but it also attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command during installation.",
  "sources": "The PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen, triggered if the 'tahg' directory does not exist.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command which is encoded; this could potentially lead to code execution or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory existence -> If absent, runs a hidden PowerShell command (decoded from base64) -> During setup, executes installation parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of an encoded PowerShell command during package setup without user consent; use of try-except blocks that suppress all exceptions, hiding potential errors; attempt to run subprocess with creation flags that hide execution windows.",
  "analysis": "The code imports distutils for setup, then conditionally executes a hidden PowerShell command if the 'tahg' directory does not exist. The command is provided as an encoded string, which, when decoded, likely contains malicious or obfuscated code. This command runs asynchronously with no window shown. The setup() function defines package metadata but is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses errors. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors consistent with attempting to run hidden or malicious code during installation, which is suspicious. The encoding of the PowerShell command and suppression of errors are notable anomalies. The core concern is the hidden execution of potentially malicious code during package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by executing an obfuscated PowerShell command during package installation, which could be used for malicious purposes such as backdoor access, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The use of encoded commands and suppressed error handling further support suspicion. The package should be considered unsafe until further analysis confirms the intent and content of the PowerShell command.",
