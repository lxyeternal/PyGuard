{
  "purpose": "The code executes a conditional, obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup, likely for malicious purposes such as downloading or executing external code or backdoors.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; execution of obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "Execution of hidden PowerShell command which may download, run malicious payloads, or establish backdoors.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers subprocess call; obfuscated command runs silently with no user interaction or validation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded, obfuscated PowerShell command; silent execution with suppressed errors; conditional execution based on filesystem state.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup but includes a suspicious obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently, which is a common tactic in malicious supply chain attacks. The command's purpose is hidden, and error suppression conceals potential failures. The high obfuscation and execution during setup strongly suggest malicious intent, possibly to download or execute malicious payloads without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to the execution of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell commands during package installation. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and conditional logic are indicative of potential malware or backdoor activity. Based on the analysis, the malware score is set to 1, but given the lack of decoded payload confirmation, a conservative high score is justified. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the package should be considered malicious until further decoding or analysis confirms safety.",
