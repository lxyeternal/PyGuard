      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to the execution of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell commands during package installation. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and conditional logic are indicative of potential malware or backdoor activity. Based on the analysis, the malware score is set to 1, but given the lack of decoded payload confirmation, a conservative high score is justified. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the package should be considered malicious until further decoding or analysis confirms safety."
