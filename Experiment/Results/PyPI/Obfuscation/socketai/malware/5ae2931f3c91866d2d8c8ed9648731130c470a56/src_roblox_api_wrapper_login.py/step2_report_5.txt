  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their findings with the original code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Summary of the original code:**\n- Two functions with obfuscated names.\n- Both functions are empty; no logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n- Names suggest potential for handling cookies and user credentials, but no implementation.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Placeholder functions, no logic.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; functions are empty, obfuscated names.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign but incomplete; no malicious activity evident.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.2, Obfuscated 0.8, Malware 0, Security Risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The low confidence and malware score are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Placeholder, possibly for auth/session.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; functions are empty, obfuscated names.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; obfuscation warrants caution.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.4, Obfuscated 0.8, Malware 0, Security Risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. The security risk is slightly increased due to obfuscation but still minimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Placeholder functions, possibly for auth/session.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern; no logic, obfuscated names.\n- **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.4, Obfuscated 0.8, Malware 0, Security Risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Placeholder functions, parameters suggest untrusted data.\n- **Analysis:** Functions are empty; no processing or data flow.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, incomplete code.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, Obfuscated 0.9, Malware 0, Security Risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; high confidence in benignity, high obfuscation noted.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Placeholder, possibly for user/session handling.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscated names, no implementation, potential concealment.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscation could be malicious in larger context, but no evidence here.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.4, Obfuscated 0.8, Malware 0, Security Risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable; cautious but no direct malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is just placeholder functions with obfuscated names.\n- No logic, data flows, or external interactions are present.\n- Malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the code's benign appearance.\n- Obfuscation is consistently high, which warrants caution if these functions are invoked elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations & Final Scores:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Given the code is purely placeholder with no logic, the malware score should remain at **0**. No malicious activity is detectable from this snippet.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** High obfuscation (0.8-0.9) is justified, as the function names are nonsensical and intentionally obscure purpose.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the functions are empty, and there's no evidence of malicious behavior, the risk should stay low. However, the obfuscation warrants some caution, so a slightly elevated score (~0.1-0.2) is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0**         | **0.8**             | **0.1**    |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be placeholder functions with obfuscated names, with no operational logic or data handling. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not, by itself, indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, but I would keep the malware score at zero, and the risk score at about 0.1, reflecting the obfuscation concern without evidence of malicious activity.",
