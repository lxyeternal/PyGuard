  "purpose": "Placeholder functions with obfuscated names, no logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (cookie, username, password), but no actual data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external calls present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; functions are empty.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are empty with highly obfuscated names; no implementation or side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two empty functions with obfuscated names, serving as placeholders or stubs. No logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. The obfuscation suggests potential concealment but does not indicate malicious activity. The absence of code execution paths or side effects supports a benign assessment. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and security risks are minimal due to lack of operational code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign placeholder functions with obfuscated names, posing no current security threat. The high obfuscation warrants caution if invoked in a larger context, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior.",
