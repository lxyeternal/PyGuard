      "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation techniques that could be used to hide malicious dependencies or payloads, but no active malicious behavior is evident. The suspicious variable name and dependency list justify a moderate malware score (~0.4) and high obfuscation score (~0.8). It is recommended to further investigate the actual dependencies and the context in which this setup script is used before trusting or deploying this package."
