  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution, with an obfuscated variable containing dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static strings in setup parameters, obfuscated variable 'pNWNxuCnGCGRXQeRAahhEReQSjVHYkOu' assigned a list of dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no dynamic input, output, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Assignment of dependencies list to a non-standard, obfuscated variable; no further data flow or execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name, use of a non-standard key in setup, misspelled dependency 'tryquests', no actual code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script with static metadata. The variable name and key are highly obfuscated, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The dependencies list includes 'requests' and a misspelled 'tryquests', potentially indicating obfuscation or malicious intent. No dynamic code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports reflect these concerns, with malware scores up to 0.4 and high obfuscation scores (~0.8). Given the static nature and lack of active malicious activity, the overall threat is moderate but warrants caution and further verification of dependencies and usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation techniques that could be used to hide malicious dependencies or payloads, but no active malicious behavior is evident. The suspicious variable name and dependency list justify a moderate malware score (~0.4) and high obfuscation score (~0.8). It is recommended to further investigate the actual dependencies and the context in which this setup script is used before trusting or deploying this package.",
