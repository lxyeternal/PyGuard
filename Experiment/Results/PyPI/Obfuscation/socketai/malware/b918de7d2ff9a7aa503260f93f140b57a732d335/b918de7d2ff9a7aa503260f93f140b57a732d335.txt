      "conclusion": "Based on the provided descriptions, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the limited data. Slightly lowering risk scores to 0.1 could be considered for increased conservativeness, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the dependency appears benign."
