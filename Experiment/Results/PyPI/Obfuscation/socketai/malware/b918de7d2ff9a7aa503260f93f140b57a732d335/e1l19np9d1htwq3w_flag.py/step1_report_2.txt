  "purpose": "The code attempts to retrieve an access token from a Google Cloud metadata server and then exfiltrate it to a remote server, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Metadata server at 'http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token'",
  "sinks": "Sending token data to 'https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log' via POST request",
  "flows": "Code retrieves token from the metadata server (source), then sends it to an external server (sink), indicating data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a private IP address for metadata access, unusual variable naming, sending potentially sensitive token data externally, try-except blocks without specific handling, and obfuscated-like variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to access the Google Cloud metadata server to obtain a default service account token. If successful, it exfiltrates this token to an external server using an HTTP POST request. The URL used for exfiltration appears suspicious and is likely a command-and-control or logging endpoint. The variable names are obfuscated, which can be a sign of malicious intent. The code lacks any legitimate or benign purpose, such as credential management, logging, or user interaction. The second function is trivial and unrelated. The code could be part of a malicious payload aimed at stealing access tokens and exfiltrating them. It also contains error handling that just prints errors without any mitigation or alerting.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears malicious, attempting to steal metadata tokens from a cloud environment and send them to an external server. The obfuscation and exfiltration pattern are common in malicious scripts. It should be flagged for potential malicious activity.",
