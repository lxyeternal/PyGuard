{
  "purpose": "This script appears to perform a variety of malicious activities, including stealing cookies, passwords, and other sensitive data from browsers and applications, as well as exfiltrating data to remote servers. It also includes functions for downloading and executing files, potentially installing or controlling malware remotely.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment variables, files from browser data directories, local database files, local storage files, and remote data via network requests and URL open requests.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to external servers via HTTP POST requests, Discord webhooks, and transfer.sh uploads. It also executes system commands, kills processes, and manipulates local files and databases.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data sources such as browser database files, cookies, and environment variables flow into extraction functions, then are encoded or decrypted, and subsequently exfiltrated via network requests or uploads. There are also command executions and process kills that are triggered based on extracted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable names, conditional code execution based on environment, extensive use of threading for concurrent operations, suspicious URL (Discord webhook), dynamic package installation, and file handling that suggests data exfiltration. The code also references and manipulates specific user data paths, indicates possible credential or session theft, and includes functions for decrypting stored browser passwords.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing many modules, some with potential obfuscation, and establishes a suspicious Discord webhook URL. It includes functions to fetch the public IP, download and decrypt stored browser credentials, cookies, and other sensitive data, and then upload or send that data to external servers. There are functions for process management, file archiving, and recursive directory traversal, all tailored to collect user data. Threading is used extensively for parallel operations, indicating an attempt to perform multiple data theft activities simultaneously. The code manipulates known locations of browser data, wallet files, and other personal files, often copying and processing them before exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded URLs, decryption routines, and the focus on credential and data extraction strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a comprehensive information stealer targeting browser data, cookies, passwords, wallets, and other personal information. It exfiltrates data to external servers and Discord, kills security-related processes, and operates stealthily with obfuscated variable names and multithreaded execution. These behaviors confirm malicious intent with high confidence. The code's structure and functions are typical of a stealer malware designed for data theft and remote control.",
