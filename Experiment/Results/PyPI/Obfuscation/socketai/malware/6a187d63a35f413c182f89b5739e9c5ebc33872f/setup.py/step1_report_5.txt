{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform a comprehensive data collection and exfiltration operation, including retrieving system information, stealing cookies, passwords, and other sensitive data, and exfiltrating it to remote servers via webhooks and file uploads. It also installs required dependencies and attempts to execute commands on the system, indicating malicious intent to extract and transmit user data covertly.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, local files (e.g., browser storage, login databases, cookies), user input via network requests, and local system files (e.g., Chrome, Opera, Steam, wallet data). It also retrieves system IP address and system cryptographic keys.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over network requests to Discord webhooks, transfer.sh, and other remote endpoints. It writes data to temporary files and zips sensitive information for exfiltration. Additionally, it executes system commands, kills processes, and manipulates browser and wallet files.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data is extracted from system files and cookies, decrypted using cryptographic keys, and then sent via HTTP POST requests to remote webhooks and transfer services. Files such as browser storage, login data, and cookies are copied, processed, and uploaded. Command execution and process termination are used to manipulate system states during data theft.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated and inconsistent variable names, extensive use of threading for concurrent operations, dynamic dependency installation, and functions designed to access and decrypt stored passwords, cookies, and system cryptographic keys indicate malicious behavior. The code also attempts to kill processes and manipulate browser and wallet data, which is unusual for legitimate packages.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by importing modules and installing dependencies (requests, pycryptodome). It then defines multiple functions for system info retrieval, encrypted data decryption, network communication, and data exfiltration. It specifically targets browser data (Chrome, Opera, Yandex, Edge), wallet files (Atomic, Exodus, Steam), and Discord-related files, collecting cookies, passwords, and tokens. The code leverages threading to concurrently extract data from multiple sources, encrypts or decrypts stored credentials, and uploads findings to remote webhooks or file hosting services. It also kills specific processes related to browsers and wallets to ensure data access or prevent interference. The variable and function naming is intentionally obscure, and the code contains functions for checking tokens, uploading data, and exfiltrating files. The overall structure and activities strongly suggest malicious intent, aimed at theft of sensitive user data and system control.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious. It is designed to silently collect and decrypt sensitive data from browsers, wallets, and system files, then exfiltrate this data to remote servers via webhooks and file uploads. It also manipulates system processes and targets multiple data sources, confirming malicious intent to compromise user privacy and security.",
