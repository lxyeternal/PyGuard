      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate package setup script with heavy obfuscation. The irregular argument in report 4 warrants further inspection but does not currently show malicious activity. Overall, the supply chain dependency appears safe, with a low security risk."

      "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and exhibits malicious behavior, including remote payload fetching and execution, obfuscation, and repeated invocation via wrapped request functions. The undefined 'executable' variable suggests obfuscation or incomplete code, but the core intent is clear: to download and run remote files stealthily. It should be classified as malware with high severity."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and suspicious syntax but lacks concrete evidence of malicious behavior. The risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and potential concealment tactics. Further context or full code review is recommended before making definitive security assessments."
