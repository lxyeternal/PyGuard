  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; defining package metadata and dependencies in variables; calling setup() with configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into dangerous operations; setup() parameters are standard and contain no untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> defining metadata variables -> calling setup() with these variables; no untrusted data flow to insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., SAdeZRiUoAEshPZZdJmVJpIuhhughQXL, IzFaXdwpmMvcvznjvjseEGTkErOUtlFo) which seem unnecessary and obscure intent; inconsistent key naming and a malformed argument ('oDsSxinbefatdyMklbOxXFUIzTjaeIdt=') which appears to be a typo or malicious placeholder; unusual variable names and irregular formatting; no actual malicious code but the obfuscation and potential typo raise suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup with standard metadata, dependencies, and data files. The use of highly obfuscated variable names and the malformed argument in setup() suggest an attempt to hide or obscure intent. No code indicates malicious activities such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The obfuscation could be an attempt to evade detection or mislead reviewers. Overall, no malicious behavior is explicitly present, but the obfuscation and unusual variable naming are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with obfuscated variable names and a possible typo in a setup argument. No direct malicious behavior or malware is evident, but the obfuscation and irregularities warrant caution. It appears to be a benign setup script with some unnecessary obfuscation.",
