{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long_description; static assignment of package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setting metadata variables -> calling setup() with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names; presence of a malformed argument 'oDsSxinbefatdyMklbOxXFUIzTjaeIdt=' which appears suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py with obfuscated variable names, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No dynamic or network activity is present. The malformed argument could be a typo or an obfuscation attempt, raising some suspicion but no direct evidence of malicious intent. The obfuscation might be to conceal proprietary details or evade detection, but it does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate package setup script with heavy obfuscation. The irregular argument in report 4 warrants further inspection but does not currently show malicious activity. Overall, the supply chain dependency appears safe, with a low security risk.",
