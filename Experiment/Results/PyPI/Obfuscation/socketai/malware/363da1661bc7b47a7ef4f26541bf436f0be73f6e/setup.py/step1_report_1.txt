{
  "purpose": "Configure the setup for the Python package 'ep96vpcqw3maj1se', including metadata, dependencies, and packaging details.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description, and uses hardcoded strings for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only handles static package setup data and file reading.",
  "flows": "Reads file content into 'long_description' and uses hardcoded package metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'SAdeZRiUoAEshPZZdJmVJpIuhhughQXL') and inconsistent variable naming, which could indicate intentional obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration script for a Python package. It reads a README.md file for the long description and defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and other setup parameters. Despite obfuscated variable names, the code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions such as network activity, code execution beyond static setup, or data exfiltration. All operations are standard for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file with no signs of malware or security issues.",
