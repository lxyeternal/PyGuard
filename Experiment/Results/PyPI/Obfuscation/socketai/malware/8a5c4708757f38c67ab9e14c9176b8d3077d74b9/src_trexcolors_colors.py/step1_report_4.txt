{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL and runs it, then deletes the file.",
  "sources": "Requests library to fetch remote content, URL string for downloading the executable.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'launcher.exe' via os.system, which runs the downloaded executable.",
  "flows": "Download from URL -> Save as 'launcher.exe' -> Execute 'launcher.exe' -> Delete 'launcher.exe'.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from a Discord CDN link and executes it without any verification or validation. No checksums, signatures, or validation steps are present. The direct execution of a downloaded file is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'requests' and 'os' modules. It prints a loading message, then fetches an executable file from a Discord CDN URL. The downloaded content is saved as 'launcher.exe'. The script then runs this executable using os.system(), and afterwards removes the file. The process of downloading and executing a remote file without validation indicates potential malicious activity, especially since the executable source is an external, unverified link. The code appears designed to run potentially malicious software stealthily.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious as it downloads and executes an external executable without verification. It is likely malicious or intended for malicious purposes, such as installing backdoors or malware.",
