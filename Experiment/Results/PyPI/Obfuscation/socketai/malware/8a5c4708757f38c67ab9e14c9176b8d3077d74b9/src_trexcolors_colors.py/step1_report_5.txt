{
  "purpose": "Download and execute an external executable file from a specified URL.",
  "sources": "The URL string, the response content from requests.get, and the open() file write operation.",
  "sinks": "The os.system('launcher.exe') call which executes the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "URL string -> requests.get() -> file write -> os.system() to run the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading an executable from a remote URL and immediately executing it without validation or sandboxing, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. No integrity checks or validation are performed on the downloaded file. The code prints 'Loading...' which could be obfuscation or distraction.",
  "analysis": "The script imports requests and os modules, then downloads an executable from a Discord CDN URL. It saves this file locally as 'launcher.exe' and executes it immediately. The executable is then deleted. The process involves fetching potentially untrusted code and executing it without any verification, which is a high security risk. The code lacks validation, signature checks, or any user consent, making it highly suspicious and likely malicious. The purpose seems to be to run external code remotely hosted, which could be used for malware delivery, remote control, or other malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code downloads and executes a remote executable without verification, presenting a significant security risk and likely malicious intent. It could lead to system compromise or malicious activities.",
