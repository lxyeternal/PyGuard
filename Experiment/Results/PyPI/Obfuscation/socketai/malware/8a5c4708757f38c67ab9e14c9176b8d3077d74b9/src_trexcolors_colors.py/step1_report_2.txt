{
  "purpose": "Download and execute an external executable file from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "requests.get() to fetch remote content, and os.system() to execute the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing 'launcher.exe' which is the downloaded executable.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves remote executable -> file written to disk as 'launcher.exe' -> os.system() runs the downloaded executable.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from a URL and runs it immediately without validation or verification. No error handling or integrity checks are present. The URL points to a potentially malicious executable, and the direct execution suggests malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports requests and os modules, then prints 'Loading...'. It downloads an executable file from a Discord CDN URL and writes it to 'launcher.exe'. Immediately after, it executes this file via os.system() and deletes it afterward. The code does not verify the downloaded content, lacks error handling, and directly runs a remote binary, which is highly suspicious and typical of malware or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by automatically downloading and executing a remote executable without validation. This is indicative of a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. The code's intent appears malicious and poses significant security risks.",
