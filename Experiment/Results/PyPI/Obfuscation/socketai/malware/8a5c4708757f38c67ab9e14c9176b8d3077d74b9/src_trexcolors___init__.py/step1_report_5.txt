  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the definition of a Python package module, potentially for general utility or specific functionality, but the exact intent cannot be determined definitively from the fragment.",
  "sources": "Data inputs may come from environment variables, user inputs, or external files if present, but no explicit sources are visible in the provided code fragment.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file I/O, or subprocess executions if invoked, but none are explicitly evident here.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flow is observed in the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no obvious anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic within the visible fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard Python module with no overt malicious indicators. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries is not evident as suspicious. Without additional context or hidden code, no malicious behavior is detectable. The structure and formatting look typical for Python modules, with no obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign and standard, with no suspicious behaviors detected. However, the assessment is limited by the absence of full code context.",
