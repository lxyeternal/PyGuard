{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information during package installation and exfiltrates it to an external Slack webhook, indicating malicious data theft activity.",
  "sources": "System commands executed via os.popen() (e.g., 'uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist', 'whoami', 'hostname')",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing a curl command that POSTs JSON data containing system info to an external URL",
  "flows": "Sources (system commands) gather data -> data stored in variables -> formatted into JSON string -> sink (curl via os.system) transmits data externally",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; data exfiltration during package install; hardcoded webhook URL; collection of sensitive info without user consent",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated install class that, during package installation, executes platform-specific commands to gather system info such as hostname, user, IP addresses, OS details, and process list. It then constructs a JSON payload with this info and sends it via a curl command to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL using os.system(). The behavior indicates covert data exfiltration, with no malicious payloads or destructive actions present. The obfuscation and timing during install are suspicious. The pattern aligns with malicious reconnaissance or privacy invasion activities. Scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, obfuscated ~0.8, security risk ~0.9) are justified given the covert exfiltration of sensitive data. The code's intent appears malicious, warranting high security concern and removal from repositories.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-probability malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during package setup, with obfuscation and hardcoded external webhook. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the activity poses significant privacy and security risks. It should be flagged as malicious or highly suspicious.",
