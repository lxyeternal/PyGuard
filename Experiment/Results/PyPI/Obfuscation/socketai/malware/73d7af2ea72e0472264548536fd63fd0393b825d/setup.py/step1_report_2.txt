  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that gathers system information and sends it via a webhook.",
  "sources": "Input sources include system commands executed via os.popen (e.g., 'uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist', 'whoami', 'hostname').",
  "sinks": "The data collected is formatted into a JSON payload and sent via an HTTP POST request using os.system with curl to a specific Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Sources (system commands) feed data into variables, which are then formatted into a JSON string and sent through os.system() call to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects extensive system information (host details, network info, running processes) and transmits it to an external endpoint without any user consent or apparent purpose. The class name is obfuscated. The data transmission occurs during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that overrides the installation process. During installation, it executes platform-specific system commands to gather information about the system, including OS details, network configuration, user info, and process list. This data is then formatted into a JSON payload and sent to a Slack webhook URL via a curl command executed with os.system. The webhook URL appears to be a real Slack webhook, indicating possible data exfiltration. The code does not sanitize or restrict the data sent, and the information collected can be sensitive. The obfuscated class name suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity. The collection and transmission of system information during package installation are highly suspicious, as this could be used for reconnaissance or data theft without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly collecting detailed system information during package installation and exfiltrating it to an external server via a webhook. The purpose appears to be surveillance or data theft. The obfuscation and timing raise significant security concerns. The package should not be trusted or used.",
