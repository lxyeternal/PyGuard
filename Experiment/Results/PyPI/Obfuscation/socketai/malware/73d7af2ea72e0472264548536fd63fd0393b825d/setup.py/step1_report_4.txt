{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it includes additional commands executed during installation that collect system information and send it via a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "os.popen calls reading system information (uname, ifconfig, curl, systeminfo, ipconfig, tasklist, whoami, hostname)",
  "sinks": "os.system call that sends collected data to an external Slack webhook URL",
  "flows": "Sources (system info commands) feed into variables; these variables are formatted into a JSON payload and sent via os.system to a remote URL",
  "anomalies": "Code collects sensitive system info such as hostname, username, OS details, IP addresses, running processes, and sends this data externally without user consent; use of obfuscated class and method names; execution of network commands during installation",
  "analysis": "The script defines a class with an obfuscated name that overrides the install command. During installation, it gathers system information based on platform, storing outputs in variables. It then constructs a JSON payload with system details and POSTs it to a Slack webhook URL. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating the data is sent to an external, possibly malicious, endpoint. The obfuscation and the collection of detailed system data without user awareness are suspicious. No direct malicious payload or destructive actions are present, but the data exfiltration behavior and obfuscated code raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting detailed system information during package installation and exfiltrating it to an external service without user consent. While it does not perform destructive actions, its data collection and transmission are indicative of malicious intent, likely for tracking or reconnaissance. The obfuscation and unusual setup indicate potential malicious intent.",
