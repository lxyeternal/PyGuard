This is useful when running proxy for authentication e.g. an OAuth proxy. The URL may contain a path prefix, like http://mydomain.com/path/to/spark/, allowing you to serve the UI for multiple Spark clusters and other web applications through the same virtual host and port. Normally, this should be an absolute URL including scheme (http/https), host and port. It is possible to specify a relative URL starting with "/" here. In this case, all URLs generated by the Spark UI and Spark REST APIs will be server-relative links -- this will still work, as the entire Spark UI is served through the same host and port. The setting affects link generation in the Spark UI, but the front-end reverse proxy is responsible for stripping a path prefix before forwarding the request, rewriting redirects which point directly to the Spark master, redirecting access from http://mydomain.com/path/to/spark to http://mydomain.com/path/to/spark/ (trailing slash after path prefix); otherwise relative links on the master page do not work correctly. This setting affects all the workers and application UIs running in the cluster and must be set identically on all the workers, drivers and masters. In is only effective when spark.ui.reverseProxy is turned on. This setting is not needed when the Spark master web UI is directly reachable. Note that the value of the setting can't contain the keyword `proxy` or `history` after split by "/". Spark UI relies on both keywords for getting REST API endpoints from URIs.""",
