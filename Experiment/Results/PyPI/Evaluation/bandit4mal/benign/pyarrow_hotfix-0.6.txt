7	Disallowed deserialization of 'arrow.py_extension_type':

12	Reading of untrusted Parquet or Feather files with a PyExtensionType column
13	allows arbitrary code execution.
14	If you trust this file, you can enable reading the extension type by one of:
15	
16	- upgrading to pyarrow >= 14.0.1, and call `pa.PyExtensionType.set_auto_load(True)`
17	- disable this error by running `import pyarrow_hotfix; pyarrow_hotfix.uninstall()`
18	
19	We strongly recommend updating your Parquet/Feather files to use extension types
20	derived from `pyarrow.ExtensionType` instead, and register this type explicitly.
21	See https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/python/extending_types.html#defining-extension-types-user-defined-types
22	for more details.
