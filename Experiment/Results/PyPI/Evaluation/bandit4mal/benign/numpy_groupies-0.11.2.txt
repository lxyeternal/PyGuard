6	    See readme file at https://github.com/ml31415/numpy-groupies for a full
7	    description.  Below we reproduce the "Full description of inputs"
8	    section from that readme, note that the text below makes references to
9	    other portions of the readme that are not shown here.
10	
11	    group_idx:
12	        this is an array of non-negative integers, to be used as the "labels"
13	        with which to group the values in ``a``. Although we have so far
14	        assumed that ``group_idx`` is one-dimensional, and the same length as
15	        ``a``, it can in fact be two-dimensional (or some form of nested
16	        sequences that can be converted to 2D).  When ``group_idx`` is 2D, the
17	        size of the 0th dimension corresponds to the number of dimensions in
18	        the output, i.e. ``group_idx[i,j]`` gives the index into the ith
19	        dimension in the output
20	        for ``a[j]``.  Note that ``a`` should still be 1D (or scalar), with
21	        length matching ``group_idx.shape[1]``.
22	    a:
23	        this is the array of values to be aggregated.  See above for a
24	        simple demonstration of what this means.  ``a`` will normally be a
25	        one-dimensional array, however it can also be a scalar in some cases.
26	    func: default='sum'
27	        the function to use for aggregation.  See the section above for
28	        details. Note that the simplest way to specify the function is using a
29	        string (e.g. ``func='max'``) however a number of aliases are also
30	        defined (e.g. you can use the ``func=np.max``, or even ``func=max``,
31	        where ``max`` is the
32	        builtin function).  To check the available aliases see ``utils.py``.
33	    size: default=None
34	        the shape of the output array. If ``None``, the maximum value in
35	        ``group_idx`` will set the size of the output.  Note that for
36	        multidimensional output you need to list the size of each dimension
37	        here, or give ``None``.
38	    fill_value: default=0
39	        in the example above, group 2 does not have any data, so requires some
40	        kind of filling value - in this case the default of ``0`` is used.  If
41	        you had set ``fill_value=nan`` or something else, that value would
42	        appear instead of ``0`` for the 2 element in the output.  Note that
43	        there are some subtle interactions between what is permitted for
44	        ``fill_value`` and the input/output ``dtype`` - exceptions should be
45	        raised in most cases to alert the programmer if issue arrise.
46	    order: default='C'
47	        this is relevant only for multimensional output.  It controls the
48	        layout of the output array in memory, can be ``'F'`` for fortran-style.
49	    dtype: default=None
50	        the ``dtype`` of the output.  By default something sensible is chosen
51	        based on the input, aggregation function, and ``fill_value``.
52	    ddof: default=0
53	        passed through into calculations of variance and standard deviation
54	        (see above).
