17	Python implementations of the Porter, Porter2, Paice-Husk, and Lovins stemming
18	algorithms for English. These implementations are straightforward and
19	efficient, unlike some Python versions of the same algorithms available on the
20	Web. This package is an extraction of the stemming code included in the Whoosh
21	search engine.
22	
23	Note that these are *pure Python* implementations. Python wrappers for, e.g.
24	the Snoball stemmers and the C implementation of the Porter stemmer are
25	available on PyPI and will be faster if using compiled code is an option for
26	you.
27	
28	Stemming algorithms attempt to automatically remove suffixes (and in some
29	cases prefixes) in order to find the "root word" or stem of a given word. This
30	is useful in various natural language processing scenarios, such as search.
31	
32	In general ``porter2`` is the best overall stemming algorithm, but not
33	necessarily the fastest or most aggressive.
34	
35	The ``stemming`` package contains modules for each algorithm (``lovins``,
36	``paicehusk``, ``porter``, and ``porter2``). Each module contains a ``stem()``
37	function::
38	
39	    >> from stemming.porter2 import stem
40	    >> stem("factionally")
41	    faction
42	
43	(The Paice-Husk algorithm allows custom stemming rule sets, so the
44	``paicehusk`` module also includes a ``PaiceHuskStemmer`` class you can
45	instantiate with custom rules.)
46	
47	The source code for this package is available on BitBucket:
48	
49	http://bitbucket.org/mchaput/stemming
