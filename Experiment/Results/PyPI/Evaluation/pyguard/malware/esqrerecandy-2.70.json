      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string passed via the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell code, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), which is a stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to evade repeated detection or to target specific environments. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggest suspicious or attacker-controlled infrastructure. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during import or setup is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is executed during package installation or import. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup, all of which are strongly associated with malware."
