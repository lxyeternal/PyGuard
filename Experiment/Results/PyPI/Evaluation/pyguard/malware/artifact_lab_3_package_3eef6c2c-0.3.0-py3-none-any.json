      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to retrieve an authentication token from the Google Compute Engine metadata service, which is a sensitive credential that can grant access to cloud resources. It then sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL hosted on an ngrok domain, which is commonly used for exposing local servers to the internet and often abused by attackers for data exfiltration. This behavior constitutes unauthorized collection and exfiltration of sensitive credentials without user consent or legitimate purpose, a hallmark of malicious activity. The automatic execution of this token exfiltration upon script run, without any user interaction or notification, further confirms the malicious intent."
