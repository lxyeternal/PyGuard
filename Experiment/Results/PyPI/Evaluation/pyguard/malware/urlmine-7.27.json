      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The use of subprocess to spawn PowerShell with an encoded command, especially in a setup script context, is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can be used to execute arbitrary or harmful code silently during package installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscation and no legitimate purpose strongly indicates malicious behavior."
