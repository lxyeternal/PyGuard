      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a stealth or persistence mechanism. The PowerShell command runs in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden) and uses the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to avoid user detection. Additionally, the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and may be linked to malicious actors. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during the setup phase is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent or interaction. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation, all of which are hallmark signs of malware."
