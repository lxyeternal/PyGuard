      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of Base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command is a classic obfuscation technique to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or obvious detection. This behavior is strongly indicative of malicious intent, as it leverages obfuscated shell execution during package setup, a known vector for supply chain attacks and stealthy payload delivery. The rest of the code is a typical setup script, but the hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell command during installation is a hallmark of malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
