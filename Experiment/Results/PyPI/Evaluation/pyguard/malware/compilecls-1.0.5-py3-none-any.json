      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It collects sensitive user data such as browser cookies, saved passwords, credit card information, Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Minecraft files, and system information including Windows keys, hardware IDs, IP geolocation, and user environment details. It decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows APIs and AES decryption, then writes this data to files in temporary directories. The code then compresses these files into zip archives and exfiltrates them to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL under the attacker's control. It also attempts to inject malicious JavaScript code into Discord client files to maintain persistence and steal tokens. The script includes anti-analysis and anti-VM checks to avoid running in certain environments. It monitors and manipulates the clipboard to replace cryptocurrency addresses with attacker-controlled addresses, a known clipboard hijacking technique to steal cryptocurrency. The code runs stealthily by hiding its window and killing processes related to Discord and debugging tools. It uses threading and asynchronous calls to perform these actions in the background without user interaction or consent. The presence of hardcoded attacker URLs, base64-encoded encrypted keys, and direct network communication to attacker-controlled endpoints further confirms its malicious intent. Overall, this code is a sophisticated credential stealer and spyware designed to silently harvest and exfiltrate sensitive user data from Windows systems."
