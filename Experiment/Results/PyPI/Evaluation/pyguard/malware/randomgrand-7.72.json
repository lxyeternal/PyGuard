      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW ensures the PowerShell window is hidden, which is a stealth technique. This behavior is executed automatically during the import or setup phase without user interaction or notification, which is suspicious. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during setup strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery. According to the provided knowledge points, spawning PowerShell in hidden mode with encoded commands during package installation is a well-known malware technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
