      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class 'Updater' that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it constructs a URL in an obfuscated manner by concatenating single-character variables to form a suspicious URL: 'https://filebin.net/95iifmxlei9dcctd/qrcodegen.py'. It then performs an HTTP GET request to this URL using the 'requests' library, writes the downloaded content to a local file named 'qrcodegen.py', and immediately executes this file as a Python script via subprocess. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. The package installation process is hijacked to download and execute arbitrary code from an untrusted, external source without user consent or validation. The obfuscation of the URL construction, the automatic download and execution of remote code during install, and the lack of any integrity checks or user interaction are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is a well-known vector for remote code execution and malware propagation in Python packages."
