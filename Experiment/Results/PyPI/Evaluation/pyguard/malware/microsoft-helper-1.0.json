      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a temporary Python script that contains a command to download and execute code directly from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/rg8v8/raw) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. This dynamic retrieval and execution of remote code without any validation or user consent is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. Furthermore, the script then attempts to execute this temporary file in a new process using a system call that launches the Python interpreter in windowed mode, which is a stealthy execution technique. This occurs during the package setup phase, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The package name and metadata appear generic and do not justify such behavior. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute arbitrary remote code silently. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is malicious."
