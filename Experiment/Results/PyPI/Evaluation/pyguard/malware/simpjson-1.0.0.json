      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' module and the 'Fernet' class from the 'fernet' package, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of code obfuscation and dynamic code execution during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of encrypted payloads that are decrypted and executed without user interaction or consent, especially during installation, strongly indicates malicious intent. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description strings further suggest an attempt to evade detection. The code also specifies Windows as the target OS, which aligns with the conditional execution of the malicious payload. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including arbitrary code execution from obfuscated sources during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise."
