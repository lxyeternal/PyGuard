      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The setup() call appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except block that suppresses errors, which is a common tactic to hide malicious activity during package installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell command execution in a hidden window, conditional execution based on directory existence, and suppression of errors during setup strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with stealthy payload execution or a supply chain attack vector."
