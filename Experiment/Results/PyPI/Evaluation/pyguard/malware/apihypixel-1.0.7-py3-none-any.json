      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive user information including the local IP address, username, and operating system details without any user interaction or consent. It reads multiple configuration files from user directories related to gaming or Minecraft clients, which likely contain sensitive account or credential data. The code then decodes a base64-encoded URL to retrieve a JSON object containing a webhook URL, which is attacker-controlled. It proceeds to send the collected system information along with the contents of these sensitive files via an HTTP POST request to this webhook URL. This sequence of environment discovery, sensitive file reading, obfuscated remote URL retrieval, and automated data exfiltration to an external server is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with credential-stealing malware or information stealer. There is no legitimate user notification, consent, or business logic justifying this data collection and exfiltration. The use of base64 encoding to hide the remote endpoint further supports the intent to evade detection. Therefore, this code is malicious."
