      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the suspicious URL comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the obfuscated encoded command string. This behavior is typical of malware that executes obfuscated payloads during package installation or runtime without user consent. The presence of this code in a setup script further indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation. The use of try/except to silently ignore errors also suggests an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and execution during setup strongly classifies this code as malicious."
