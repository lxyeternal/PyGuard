      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Inside this method, it checks if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'). If so, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent or interaction. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted payload, and execution during installation strongly suggest a supply chain attack vector. Additionally, the package name 'Matplotblib' is a typo-squatted variant of the legitimate 'matplotlib' package, which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook, further indicating the intent to perform network or cryptographic operations for malicious purposes. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated code, encrypted payload execution during install, and typosquatting, confirming it contains malicious behavior."
