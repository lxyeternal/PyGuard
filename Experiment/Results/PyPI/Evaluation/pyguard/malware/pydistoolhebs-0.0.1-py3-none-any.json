      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive user data. It collects environment information such as IP address and username, decrypts stored credentials using Windows APIs, and exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code uses obfuscated function and variable names, base64 decoding, and AES decryption to extract sensitive information from browser and Discord storage files. It also zips and uploads various user data folders to anonymous file hosting services. The code runs multiple threads to stealthily gather tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from common browsers, Discord clients, wallets, and gaming apps without user consent or notification. It uses subprocess calls to kill processes to access locked files and employs network requests to send stolen data. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook, automated data collection and exfiltration, use of Windows cryptographic APIs to decrypt stored secrets, and uploading of stolen data to external servers are definitive indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
