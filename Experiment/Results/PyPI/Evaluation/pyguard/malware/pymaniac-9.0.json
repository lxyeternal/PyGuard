      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It collects sensitive user environment data such as username, IP address, country, ISP, and presence of specific wallet and messaging applications (Exodus, Metamask, Ledger, Telegram). It then copies the victim's Exodus wallet data directory, zips it, and sends the archive to an attacker-controlled Telegram bot via a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. Additionally, it takes a screenshot of the victim's desktop and sends it with victim information to the same Telegram channel. If Telegram Desktop data is present, it also zips and exfiltrates the Telegram session data. The code performs these actions silently without user consent or notification and deletes the temporary files afterward to cover tracks. The use of hardcoded Telegram bot credentials, automated data collection from sensitive application directories, and exfiltration over the network to an attacker-controlled endpoint are strong indicators of malicious intent, specifically credential theft and privacy invasion."
