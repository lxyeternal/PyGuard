      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, a common stealth technique. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to a suspicious URL (\"https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm...\"), which is a known vector for downloading or executing malicious payloads. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command, the hidden execution, and the external URL strongly indicate an attempt to download and execute further malicious code without user consent. Additionally, the setup() call with a suspicious package name ('libpongvisacpu') and author email ('tahgoficial@proton.me') appears to be a disguise or part of a supply chain attack vector, as it tries to masquerade as a legitimate package while executing malicious code during installation. These behaviors align with known malware patterns such as supply chain attacks, stealth execution, and remote payload delivery."
