      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a JAR file from a hardcoded external URL hosted on GitHub releases, writes it silently to the Windows Startup folder (a known persistence location), and immediately executes it using 'java -jar'. This sequence of downloading an executable payload from an untrusted remote source, placing it in a system startup directory without user consent or notification, and executing it automatically is a classic hallmark of malware behavior. The use of the Startup folder ensures persistence across system reboots, and the lack of any validation, user interaction, or integrity checks further indicates malicious intent. Such behavior is strongly associated with malware that aims to deploy and execute arbitrary code on the victim system, potentially for persistence, payload delivery, or further compromise."
