      "malicious_behavior": "The code spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with spawning a hidden process during package setup, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such behavior is typical of malware that attempts to execute stealthy payloads or perform unauthorized actions during installation. The directory existence check for 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence mechanisms. Overall, this pattern matches known malicious behaviors including obfuscated code execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation, which are hallmark indicators of malware or supply chain attacks."
