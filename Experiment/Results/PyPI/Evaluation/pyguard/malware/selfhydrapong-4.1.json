      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized or harmful actions, as suggested by the suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscation technique. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic hallmark of malware, often used in supply chain attacks to execute malicious payloads during package installation without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears legitimate but is used here as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
