      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated in base64 UTF-16LE encoding, which is a common method to hide the true intent of the command. The command references a suspicious URL (github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe), indicating it attempts to download and execute a remote executable payload without user consent or interaction. The check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence behavior. This code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') along with the suspicious URL and obfuscated command further support malicious intent. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, remote payload download and execution, and execution during package installation, all of which are hallmark behaviors of malware."
