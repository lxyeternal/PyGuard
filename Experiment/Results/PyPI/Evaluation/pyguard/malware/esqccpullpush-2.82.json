      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the suspicious URL comment (# www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated encoded command string. This pattern of obfuscated command execution during package setup or installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup call, likely used as a cover. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup is a critical risk and confirms malicious intent."
