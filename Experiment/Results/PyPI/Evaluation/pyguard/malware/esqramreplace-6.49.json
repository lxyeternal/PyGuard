      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden) and uses subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any console window, which is a stealth technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is executed before this, during import or setup execution. This pattern of executing obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup is a known supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and potentially further payload delivery or system compromise without user consent or interaction. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
