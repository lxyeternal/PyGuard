      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware. It collects sensitive user data such as browser cookies, saved passwords, credit card information, Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, and system information (including Windows keys, hardware IDs, IP geolocation). It uses Windows APIs to decrypt encrypted browser data and Discord tokens. The code also includes a clipboard hijacker that replaces cryptocurrency wallet addresses with attacker-controlled addresses to steal funds. It exfiltrates all collected data and files via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URL (https://kekwltd.ru/relay). The malware attempts to evade detection by killing processes related to debugging and Discord clients, bypassing BetterDiscord protections, and avoiding execution in virtual machines or known analysis environments. It also installs itself to run on Windows startup and hides its activity. The code uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding, random file names, and threading to evade analysis and detection. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled URLs, automated data collection and exfiltration, clipboard hijacking, and anti-analysis measures confirm that this code is malicious and designed to steal credentials and sensitive information from infected Windows systems without user consent."
