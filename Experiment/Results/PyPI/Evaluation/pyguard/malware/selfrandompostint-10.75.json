      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing easy inspection of its intent, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, suggesting a persistence or staging mechanism. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious code during package installation without user consent or interaction. The author and email fields, along with the commented URL, appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate packages. All these factors combined strongly indicate that this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands on the victim's machine, consistent with malware behavior."
