      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a temporary Python script file containing code that downloads and executes Python code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/bjhtk/raw) without any validation or user consent. It then attempts to execute this script in a new Python interpreter process. This dynamic retrieval and execution of remote code during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The use of temporary files to stage the payload, the lack of user interaction or notification, and the execution of arbitrary code from an untrusted external source all align with known malware patterns. The setup function itself appears benign, but the pre-setup code effectively injects and runs potentially harmful code, which can lead to remote code execution, system compromise, or data exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a temporary file containing Python code that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/yg9e5/raw) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. It then attempts to execute this temporary file using the Python interpreter in a new process. This pattern of dynamically fetching and executing remote code without user consent or validation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The code uses obfuscation techniques such as aliasing imports with short names and writing the payload to a temporary file before execution, which are common evasion tactics. The immediate execution of remote code fetched at runtime is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling arbitrary code execution, potential payload delivery, and system compromise. There is no legitimate user interaction, validation, or notification, and the remote URL is not a known trusted source. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
