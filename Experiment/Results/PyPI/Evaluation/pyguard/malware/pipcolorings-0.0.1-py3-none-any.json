      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a temporary file and writes into it a Python one-liner that fetches and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.fo/raw/afb1dbd35339) without any validation or user consent. It then attempts to execute this temporary file using a Python interpreter variant (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe' to likely run in windowless mode) via a shell command. This pattern of dynamically downloading and executing remote code is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, enabling arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source. The absence of any user interaction, validation, or logging, combined with the use of a hardcoded suspicious URL and execution of downloaded code, strongly indicates this is malware or a malicious payload delivery mechanism."
