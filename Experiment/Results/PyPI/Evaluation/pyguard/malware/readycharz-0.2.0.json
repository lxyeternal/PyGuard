      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It contains heavy obfuscation using base64 encoding, base32 decoding, zlib decompression, and cryptographic decryption (Fernet). The code dynamically decrypts and decompresses a large payload and then executes it via exec on deserialized bytecode, which is a classic technique used by malware to hide its true intent and evade static analysis. The presence of cryptography.fernet, marshal, zlib, and base64 modules used in combination for dynamic code execution is a hallmark of malicious payload delivery. The code also includes numerous meaningless functions with obfuscated names and unreachable branches, which is typical of obfuscation to confuse analysis. The large embedded hex string is decrypted and decoded into executable code at runtime, indicating payload delivery. The code uses exec on dynamically generated code without any validation or user interaction, which is highly suspicious. These patterns match critical risk indicators such as code obfuscation, dynamic execution of decoded payloads, and lack of legitimate user interaction. Therefore, this code is malicious and likely designed to execute hidden payloads, potentially for data exfiltration, system compromise, or other harmful actions."
