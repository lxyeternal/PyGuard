      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally (only if the 'tahg' directory does not exist) suggests stealth and evasion techniques. This pattern—obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup—is a well-known hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the injected subprocess call with obfuscated PowerShell is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution during package installation. There is no legitimate reason for such obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution in a setup script, and no user consent or notification is present. Therefore, this code is malicious."
