      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The use of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during the setup phase (package installation) is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious payload delivery. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. There is no user interaction or notification, and the encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions (e.g., downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or data exfiltration). This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated base64-encoded shell commands, hidden process execution, and execution during package installation, all of which are strongly associated with malware."
