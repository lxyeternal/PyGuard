      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware (stealer). It collects extensive sensitive user data including system information (username, computer name, Windows key, hardware ID, IP address, geolocation), browser data (passwords, cookies, history, credit card info), Discord tokens, Minecraft and Roblox data, and clipboard contents. It decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows APIs and AES decryption, indicating intent to extract protected credentials. The code exfiltrates this data to attacker-controlled endpoints via HTTP POST requests to hardcoded suspicious URLs (e.g., https://kekwltd.ru/relay/bluescreen). It also includes clipboard hijacking functionality that replaces cryptocurrency wallet addresses with attacker addresses, a known theft technique. The code attempts to evade detection by killing processes related to debugging and Discord clients, checks for virtual machine environments, and hides its presence by copying itself to startup folders for persistence. It uses threading to run background tasks and obfuscates function and variable names. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URLs, extensive environment reconnaissance, credential decryption, data collection, and exfiltration without user consent or notification confirms this is malicious code designed for credential theft and data exfiltration."
