      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (Base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip and the encoded command referencing a domain 'cdn.discordapp.com' with a path that looks like an attachment). This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is used here to mask the malicious payload execution during installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
