      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports the 'fernet' module (installed via pip at runtime), then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large base64-encoded payload, and immediately executes the decrypted code using exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing obfuscated code at runtime is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The absence of any user interaction, the use of dynamic code execution on decrypted data, and the obfuscation via Fernet encryption strongly suggest that the code is designed to hide and run potentially harmful payloads. Such behavior is typical of malware that attempts to evade static analysis and deliver malicious functionality dynamically."
