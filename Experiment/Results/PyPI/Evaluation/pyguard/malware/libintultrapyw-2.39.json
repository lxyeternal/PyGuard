      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification, and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide its execution. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and attempts to download or execute a file named 'Esquele.exe' in a hidden manner. This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic hallmark of malware, often used in supply chain attacks to execute malicious payloads during package installation. The presence of a suspicious package name ('libintultrapyw'), author email, and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' further supports the malicious intent. The code attempts to evade detection by wrapping the execution in try/except blocks and suppressing errors. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated payload from a remote source during installation, which is a critical risk and confirms malicious behavior."
