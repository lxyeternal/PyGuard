      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Windows systems, specifically extracting sensitive information from browsers and Discord clients. It collects Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords, and other user data by accessing local application data directories, decrypting stored credentials using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption, and reading SQLite databases from browser profiles. The code then exfiltrates this stolen data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an attacker-controlled endpoint. It also uploads files to anonymous file hosting services and sends detailed user environment information (IP address, username, geolocation) along with the stolen credentials. The code uses threading to perform these actions stealthily and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. It installs required dependencies silently if missing. The presence of hardcoded attacker webhook URLs, automated extraction of sensitive tokens and credentials without user consent, decryption of encrypted browser data, and exfiltration to external servers are definitive indicators of malicious behavior. Additionally, the code masquerades as a legitimate package by including a setuptools.setup call but performs malicious actions on import and execution. All these factors confirm that this code is malicious and designed for unauthorized data theft and exfiltration."
