      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install process and, upon installation, collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com), which is not a known or trusted endpoint. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration of system and user information during package installation without user consent or notification. Such use of setuptools install hooks to collect and transmit environment data to an attacker-controlled server is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this network communication, making this code malicious."
