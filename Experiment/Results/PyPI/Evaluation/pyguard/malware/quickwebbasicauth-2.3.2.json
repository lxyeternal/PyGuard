      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a setup script for a Python package but contains a highly suspicious and malicious operation. Specifically, it opens the source file of the standard library 'socket' module (using inspect.getsourcefile(socket)) in append-binary-plus mode and writes the contents of 'QuickWebBasicAuth/tmp.py' into it. This effectively modifies a core Python library file on the user's system during package installation or build, which is a classic supply chain attack technique. Such behavior is not legitimate for any normal package and is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code does not perform any user notification or consent, and the modification of a standard library file can lead to arbitrary code execution or persistence of malicious payloads. This pattern is a known hallmark of malware that hijacks the installation process to inject malicious code into trusted system components."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It creates a temporary file as a marker and uses threading to maintain and monitor a background process. It spawns a hidden or background Python process that sets a global flag and sleeps for a very long time, likely to maintain persistence or evade detection. The main thread executes obfuscated code that attempts to establish a TCP connection to a hardcoded IP address (43.228.69.226) on port 8889, wraps the socket with SSL, and receives a length-prefixed, base64-encoded, zlib-compressed payload. This payload is then decompressed, base64-decoded, and executed dynamically via exec, which is a classic pattern for remote code execution and payload delivery. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding and compression), dynamic code execution, network communication to a suspicious hardcoded IP, and background process spawning without user interaction or notification are all hallmark traits of malware, specifically remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors. The code also attempts to evade detection by running subprocesses differently on Windows and Unix-like systems and uses daemon threads to maintain stealth. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent, and the code suppresses errors silently. All these factors combined confirm that the code is malicious."
