      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a subprocess command during the package setup phase that uses PowerShell to download an executable file from a hardcoded external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mkd3enun97s8zag/Oxzy.exe?dl=0) and saves it as '~/WindowsCache.exe'. It then immediately executes this downloaded file via Invoke-Expression. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malicious activity: downloading and executing an untrusted binary without user consent or validation, triggered automatically during package installation. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag hides the execution window, indicating stealth intent. The code also attempts to install the subprocess module if missing, which is unusual and suspicious. The package metadata is crafted to appear legitimate, but the embedded remote code execution during setup is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. Such behavior is not typical or acceptable in benign packages and poses a critical security risk."
