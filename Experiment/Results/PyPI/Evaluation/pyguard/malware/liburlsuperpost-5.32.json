      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized or harmful actions, as suggested by the suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the creation of a directory named 'tahg' as a condition to run the payload only once. This pattern of obfuscated command execution during package setup is a classic supply chain attack technique, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden, encoded PowerShell execution during installation is a critical risk and a hallmark of malware."
