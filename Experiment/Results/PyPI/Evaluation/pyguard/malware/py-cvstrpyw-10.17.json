      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads from a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip). This pattern of obfuscated command execution via PowerShell in a setup script is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup but includes this covert execution, indicating it is designed to execute malicious payloads during installation."
