      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code defines a setuptools installation hook (CustomInstall) that executes automatically during package installation. It collects sensitive environment information including hostname, current working directory, username, and network IP addresses (both private and public). It also enumerates files from root directories (c:\\, d:\\, /, /home) without user consent. The collected data is encoded (hex encoding of strings and IP address formatting) and used to construct a suspicious domain name, which is resolved via DNS lookup (socket.gethostbyname). Then, the code sends a POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (https://425a2.rt11.ml) with a JSON payload containing the collected system information and file listings. This behavior is a classic example of automated environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration performed silently during package installation, without any user interaction or notification. The use of obfuscated data encoding, hardcoded attacker-controlled domain, and immediate network communication during install time strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks and credential or environment data theft. There is no legitimate business logic or user benefit from this data collection and exfiltration, making this code malicious."
