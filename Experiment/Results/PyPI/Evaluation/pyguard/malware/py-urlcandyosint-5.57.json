      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (\"https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0\") and attempts to invoke a web request or download and execute a file named \"WindowsCache.exe\" in a hidden manner. This behavior is consistent with downloading and executing a malicious payload from a remote server without user consent or notification. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious author information ('EsqueleSquad') and an unusual package name ('py-urlcandyosint'), which may be typosquatting or malicious. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, remote payload download, and stealth techniques strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with malware or a supply chain attack."
