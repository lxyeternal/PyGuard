      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification, and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide its execution. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' in a hidden window, which is a common technique for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, or persistence. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which is a typical evasion or staging technique. The presence of this behavior in a setup script further indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation. These factors combined align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, hidden execution, remote payload retrieval, and execution during installation, confirming the code is malicious."
