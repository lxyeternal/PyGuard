      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' in a hidden manner. This pattern of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and remote code retrieval is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy payload delivery, persistence, or further exploitation. Additionally, the package name and author information appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate software, further supporting the malicious intent. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors also suggests an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
