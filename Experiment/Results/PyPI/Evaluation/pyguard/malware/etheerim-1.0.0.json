      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during installation strongly indicate a supply chain attack vector. The code does not provide any legitimate business logic or user notification before executing potentially arbitrary code. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, dynamic code execution during package installation, and lack of user consent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
