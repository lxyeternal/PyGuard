      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell command execution during the setup process is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The directory existence check for 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. The rest of the code is a typical setup call, but the subprocess call with the encoded PowerShell command is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware payload delivery during package installation."
