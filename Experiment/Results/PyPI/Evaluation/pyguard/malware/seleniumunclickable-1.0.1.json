      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class 'Updater' that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, it performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, obfuscated URL (constructed from concatenated string fragments) that points to an external server under the domain 'transfer.sh'. It downloads a Python script named 'qrcodegen.py' from this remote location and writes it to the current working directory without any user consent or validation. Immediately after writing the file, it executes this downloaded script using subprocess.check_call with the current Python interpreter. This behavior enables arbitrary remote code execution during package installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The code uses obfuscation to hide the URL, performs network communication to an untrusted external source, writes files to disk silently, and executes them without integrity checks or user interaction. Such patterns are strongly associated with malicious activity, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
