      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded), which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated detection. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (cdndiscardapp.com) and attempts to execute a file named 'Esquele.exe' in a hidden window, which strongly suggests downloading or running a malicious payload. This behavior is typical of malware that uses obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide its intent, executes code silently without user interaction, and leverages PowerShell for further exploitation or persistence. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious author and package names (EsqueleSquad, esqsupergrandstr) and an email address (tahgoficial@proton.me) that do not correspond to known legitimate projects, which is common in typosquatted or malicious packages. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk patterns including obfuscated command execution, stealthy process spawning, and references to suspicious external resources, confirming it is malicious."
