      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation without user consent or interaction. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during installation strongly indicate a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. The package name 'requiirements' is suspiciously similar to 'requirements' (a common Python file), which is a known typosquatting technique to trick users into installing malicious packages. The code also specifies setup_requires for 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook, further supporting the intent to execute malicious code. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute hidden malicious payloads during package installation on Windows systems, which is a critical security risk."
