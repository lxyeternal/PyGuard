      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further supports suspicion. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a cover or delivery mechanism. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, lack of user consent, and suspicious naming strongly indicates malicious intent, likely for executing a hidden payload or performing unauthorized actions on the host system."
