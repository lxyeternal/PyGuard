      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence mechanism. Additionally, the setup() call includes suspicious metadata such as the author 'EsqueleSquad' and a package name 'tprandomedsuper' that does not correspond to any known legitimate package, which may indicate a supply chain attack vector. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process creation, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with malware techniques such as stealthy code execution, potential payload delivery, or system compromise."
