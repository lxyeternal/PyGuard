      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification, and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide its execution. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and attempts to invoke a web request with a user-agent string, which is a common technique for downloading or executing remote payloads stealthily. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell invocation in a setup script context strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism triggered during package installation. The package name and author information appear suspicious and do not correspond to known legitimate software. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and remote code invocation during installation."
