      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads from a suspicious URL (notably 'dl.dropbox.com' with a query parameter). This pattern of obfuscated command execution during package setup or import is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling stealthy remote code execution and potential system compromise. The use of a suspicious author email and package name further supports the malicious intent."
