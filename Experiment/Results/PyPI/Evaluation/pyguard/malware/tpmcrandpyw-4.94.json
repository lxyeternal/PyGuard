      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a persistence or staging check. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raises suspicion. The setup call appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except to suppress errors, possibly to hide the malicious payload execution. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and lack of legitimate user interaction or notification strongly indicates malicious intent."
