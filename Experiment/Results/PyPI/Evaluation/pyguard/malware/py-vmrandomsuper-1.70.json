      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or staging technique. Additionally, the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and may indicate a malicious actor or group. The use of distutils setup with a suspicious package name 'py-vmrandomsuper' and the attempt to execute hidden PowerShell commands during setup further supports the conclusion that this code is designed for malicious purposes, likely as part of a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism."
