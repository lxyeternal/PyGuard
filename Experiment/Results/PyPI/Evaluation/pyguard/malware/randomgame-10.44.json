      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware to evade detection. The base64-encoded command likely contains a malicious payload or instructions, but even without decoding, the pattern of hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, this execution occurs automatically during the import or setup phase without user interaction or consent, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malware embedded in installation scripts. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of this hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution makes the overall code malicious."
