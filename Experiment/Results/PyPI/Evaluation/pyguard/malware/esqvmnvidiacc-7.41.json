      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, obfuscating its intent and evading simple detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to avoid repeated or detected runs. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the use of a suspicious package name 'esqvmnvidiacc' with an author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggest malicious intent. The code runs this hidden PowerShell command automatically during the setup process without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack pattern. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package installation, all of which are strongly associated with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
