      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence mechanism. The use of distutils setup with a suspicious package name ('librandloadver') and author information linked to 'EsqueleSquad' and an email address 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further indicates a potential supply chain attack or malicious package. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, and execution during package setup is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with malware techniques such as remote code execution, payload delivery, or persistence establishment."
