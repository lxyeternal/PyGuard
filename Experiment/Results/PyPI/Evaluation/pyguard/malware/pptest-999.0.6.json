      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system and network information including hostname, current working directory, local IP addresses, and public WAN IP address without any user interaction or consent. It then encodes this information into a DNS query format and sends it to a hardcoded suspicious domain 'hte1ck6lvk1ktcuxl0x8jfgeu50vok.burpcollaborator.net', which is a known attacker-controlled domain used for out-of-band interaction and data exfiltration. The use of DNS queries to exfiltrate data is a common covert channel technique in malware to bypass network monitoring. The code also imports the 'dns.resolver' module to perform DNS lookups to this domain, indicating active data exfiltration. The presence of a hardcoded attacker-controlled domain, automated collection and encoding of environment and network data, and covert transmission via DNS queries are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate user notification or consent, and the code is designed to stealthily gather and leak sensitive host information to an external server, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance or information-stealing malware."
