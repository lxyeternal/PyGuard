      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that automatically execute the function 'notmalfunc' during package installation or development setup. This function collects all environment variables from the host system, encodes them as URL parameters, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://ac9c-54-204-140-51.ngrok-free.app'). This behavior constitutes automated, silent exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data without user consent or notification. The use of a non-standard, attacker-controlled domain (ngrok-free.app) for data transmission during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and exfiltration. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
