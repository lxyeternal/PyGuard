      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the suspicious URL comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated command string. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to execute hidden payloads during package installation or runtime without user consent. Additionally, the package name 'tppaypalmine' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an unusual email address further raise suspicion. The presence of this obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. Therefore, this code is malicious."
