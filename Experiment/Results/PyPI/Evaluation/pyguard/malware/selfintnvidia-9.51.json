      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently is a classic technique for stealthy code execution, often used for downloading or executing further malicious payloads, privilege escalation, or persistence. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious domain in a comment, further suggesting malicious intent. The use of such obfuscation and hidden execution during a setup script is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
