      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, further indicating stealth behavior. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' (a privacy-focused email provider) adds to the suspicion. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, but the malicious payload is executed before it, during import or setup. This pattern of executing obfuscated PowerShell commands in a hidden window during package setup is a known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
