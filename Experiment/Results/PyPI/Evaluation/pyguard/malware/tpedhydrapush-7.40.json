      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip and the encoded command referencing a suspicious domain 'cdn.discordapp.com' with a path that looks like a payload). This pattern of obfuscated command execution during package setup/install is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, the hidden execution, and the suspicious domain strongly indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code (the setup call) appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. Therefore, this code is malicious."
