      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for payload delivery, persistence, or further exploitation. The base64-encoded command is not decoded or inspected in the source, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation to hide malicious intent. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation without user interaction or consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. These factors combined—obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth mode, conditional execution, and execution during package installation—are strong indicators of malicious behavior."
