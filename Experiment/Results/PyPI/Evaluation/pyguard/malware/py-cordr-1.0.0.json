      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that overrides the standard install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded byte string and decrypted at runtime. This pattern of decrypting and immediately executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The use of exec on decrypted data without any validation or user interaction is a strong indicator of arbitrary code execution. Additionally, the package name and metadata appear obfuscated and suspicious. The code contacts no explicit external URL in the snippet, but the presence of 'requests' import inside the install hook suggests potential network activity in the decrypted payload. Executing arbitrary decrypted code during installation without user consent or transparency is a critical risk and strongly indicative of malicious intent."
