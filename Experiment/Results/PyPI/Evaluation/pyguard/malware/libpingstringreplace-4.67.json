      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The setup() call with a suspicious package name ('libpingstringreplace') and author information referencing 'EsqueleSquad' and an email address 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests this is a supply chain attack or malicious package. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
