      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, upon installation, automatically sends the current user's home directory path and the current timestamp to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes automated data exfiltration of user environment information during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL to silently transmit environment data during install time, combined with the absence of any legitimate business logic or user notification, strongly indicates malicious intent."
