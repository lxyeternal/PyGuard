      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class for a Python package that, during the installation process, collects all environment variables from the host system and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://a5gpivpedls2wjfxl0bm6dmwenke84wt.oastify.com) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes silent data exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment information, which is a hallmark of malicious activity. The use of a non-standard, attacker-controlled domain and the automatic execution of this data exfiltration during package installation (a supply chain attack vector) further confirms the malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code leverages setuptools install hooks to execute this unauthorized network communication, which is a known technique for malware in Python packages."
