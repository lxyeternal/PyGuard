      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It includes base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and immediately executed via exec(), a classic obfuscation and code injection technique used by malware. The code conditionally executes different payloads depending on the operating system, with Windows payloads involving execution of a base64-decoded PowerShell command in hidden mode, which is a known stealth technique for running malicious scripts. The Linux/macOS payload similarly decodes and executes obfuscated code that performs network communication, file system manipulation, and likely data exfiltration. The code is embedded in a setup script, which means it executes automatically during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. It collects environment and user information, writes files to system or user directories, and performs network requests to suspicious or hardcoded external servers. The extensive obfuscation, lack of user interaction, and immediate execution of decoded data strongly indicate this is malicious code designed for stealthy execution, data collection, and exfiltration without user consent."
