      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which are typical stealth techniques to avoid user detection. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the embedded URL-like string in the comment and the obfuscated command. This execution happens automatically during the setup script execution without any user interaction or notification, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks or malware installation. The presence of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and the use of PowerShell for remote or local code execution are all hallmark signs of malicious intent. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is used as a cover to execute the malicious payload. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
