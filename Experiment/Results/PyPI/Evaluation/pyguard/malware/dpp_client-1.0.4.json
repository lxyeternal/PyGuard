      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes multiple shell commands to collect sensitive system information, including the current working directory ('pwd'), the current user ('whoami'), the hostname, directory listings of parent directories, and the contents of the sensitive system file '/etc/passwd'. It then encodes all this collected data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL ('http://pt.traktrain.com/req.php') without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of automated data exfiltration and system reconnaissance, which is strongly associated with malicious activity. Furthermore, this data collection and exfiltration occurs during the package setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The combination of gathering sensitive environment information, reading critical system files, and silently transmitting this data to an external server during installation is a definitive indicator of malicious intent."
