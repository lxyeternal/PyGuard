      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an attempt to avoid repeated execution or detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads or performs unauthorized actions, as indicated by the suspicious URL embedded in the encoded command ('http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/.../Esquele.exe'). This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware that execute code during package installation. The use of a suspicious author name and email, along with the package name 'selfvirtualloadrand' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip', further supports the malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute a hidden payload during installation, which is a critical risk behavior consistent with malware."
