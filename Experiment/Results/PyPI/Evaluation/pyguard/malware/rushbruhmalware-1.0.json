      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses multiple layers of obfuscation by base64 decoding and then decompressing data with zlib, followed by immediate execution of the resulting code via exec. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent as it hides the true payload and executes it dynamically, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. Additionally, the code is placed in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The package name 'rushbruhmalware' and the description explicitly stating 'this is a malware, please dont install this' further confirm the malicious nature. The use of exec on decompressed, decoded data without any validation or user interaction is a critical risk and hallmark of malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
