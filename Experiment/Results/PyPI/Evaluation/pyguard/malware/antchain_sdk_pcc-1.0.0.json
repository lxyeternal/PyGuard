      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username of the user running the installation. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io), which is an attacker-controlled server used for interaction and data collection. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration of user and system information without user consent or legitimate purpose. The use of a setup.py install hook to perform network communication and data exfiltration during package installation is a classic supply chain attack technique. There is no benign justification for this pattern, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators such as environment data collection, exfiltration to a suspicious external server, and execution during package installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
