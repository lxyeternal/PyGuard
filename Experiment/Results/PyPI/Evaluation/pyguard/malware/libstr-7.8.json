      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized or malicious actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as indicated by the presence of 'Invoke-WebRequest' and output redirection in the decoded command string. This behavior is triggered automatically during the package setup process without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious package installation scripts. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and subprocess spawning of PowerShell commands strongly indicates malicious intent."
