      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a typical evasion or persistence technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of an encoded PowerShell command strongly suggest that the payload is intended for stealthy execution, potentially for downloading or executing further malicious payloads. Additionally, this execution occurs during the setup phase of a Python package, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the setup code appears benign, but the subprocess call with obfuscated PowerShell command is a critical risk indicator of malware."
