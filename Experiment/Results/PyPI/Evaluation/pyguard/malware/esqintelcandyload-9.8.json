      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), which is typical for stealthy execution. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which may be an evasion or persistence technique. The presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the package name 'esqintelcandyload' authored by 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or to disguise the script as a legitimate package. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and lack of legitimate user interaction or business logic strongly indicates that this code is malicious."
