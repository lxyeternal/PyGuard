      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' also raise suspicion. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is triggered during import or execution of this script, which could be part of a package installation or execution process. This pattern—obfuscated PowerShell command execution in a hidden window during package setup—is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware delivery mechanisms."
