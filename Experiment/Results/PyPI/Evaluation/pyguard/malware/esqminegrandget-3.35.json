      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated runs. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide the window is a known stealth technique. Additionally, the setup() call with a suspicious package name 'esqminegrandget' and author 'EsqueleSquad' combined with the hidden PowerShell execution strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during package installation. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs further malicious actions such as downloading or executing additional payloads, exfiltrating data, or establishing persistence. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during package setup. Therefore, this code is malicious."
