      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification, and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide its execution. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The package name 'esqadpaypal' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and unrelated to the described functionality, further indicating malicious intent. The setup call appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and suspicious naming, consistent with malware or a supply chain attack."
