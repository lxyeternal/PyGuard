      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding, eval, and compile functions, which are classic indicators of malicious intent. It dynamically decodes and executes compressed and encoded payloads at runtime without any user interaction or consent. The code uses multiple layers of decoding and decompression, followed by immediate execution of the resulting code, which is a hallmark of malware attempting to evade static analysis. The obfuscation includes unusual import patterns and function/variable names designed to hide its true purpose. Such behavior is consistent with automated data exfiltration, credential theft, or remote code execution attacks. The absence of legitimate application logic, combined with the use of eval on decoded data and the presence of suspicious base64-encoded blobs, strongly indicates that this code is malicious."
