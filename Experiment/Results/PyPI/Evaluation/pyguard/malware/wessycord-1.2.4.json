      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (AfterInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://cdn-141.anonfiles.com/scUeHf23z5/cfc2b34c-1689619361/payload.exe) directly into the current working directory without any user consent or notification. Immediately after downloading, it attempts to execute this downloaded file using os.system. This behavior is a classic hallmark of a supply chain attack and remote code execution vector, where arbitrary, potentially malicious binaries are fetched and run during package installation. The lack of any validation, user interaction, or integrity checks, combined with the execution of an untrusted executable from a non-official, suspicious URL, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a critical risk indicator for malicious behavior."
