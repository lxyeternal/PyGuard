      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that executes automatically during package installation. It performs the following suspicious and potentially malicious actions: \n\n1. It retrieves the current Windows user login name and constructs paths inside the user's Start Menu Programs directory, specifically targeting the Startup folder and another folder named 'Powerpoint'. These locations are commonly used for persistence by placing executables or scripts that run on user login.\n\n2. It creates directories in these locations if they do not exist, which is unusual for a typical package installation and indicates preparation for persistence or payload deployment.\n\n3. It uses the GitPython library to clone two external GitHub repositories directly into these user-specific system folders. One repository is cloned into the Startup 'boot' folder, and the other into the 'Powerpoint' folder. Cloning code into the Startup folder is a known technique to achieve automatic execution on system startup.\n\n4. It moves a Python script ('test.py') from a subfolder inside the Startup directory to the Startup directory itself, likely to ensure it runs automatically.\n\n5. All these actions happen silently during the installation process without user interaction or notification.\n\n6. The repositories cloned have suspicious names ('test2lmaos' and 'defonotagrabber'), and the 'defonotagrabber' repository name suggests malicious intent (e.g., 'grabber' often refers to credential or data stealers).\n\n7. The code abuses the setuptools install hook to execute arbitrary code during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector.\n\nThese behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including automatic persistence setup, remote code retrieval and execution, and abuse of installation hooks. There is no legitimate reason for a package installation script to clone external repositories into user startup folders and move executable scripts there without explicit user consent or notification. Therefore, this code is malicious."
