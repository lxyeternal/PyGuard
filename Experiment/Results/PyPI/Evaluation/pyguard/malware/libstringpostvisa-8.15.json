      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the 'Hidden' window style and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely contains obfuscated instructions, potentially for downloading or executing further payloads or performing unauthorized actions. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a non-standard package name, which may be used to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate setup script. This pattern of obfuscated command execution during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and stealthy payload delivery without user consent or interaction."
