      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and dynamic execution via exec. It decodes a large base64-encoded payload and immediately executes it without any validation or user interaction. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the executed code. The use of exec on decoded data is a classic technique for delivering and running obfuscated malicious payloads, enabling remote code execution, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The code lacks any legitimate user-facing logic or transparency, and the obfuscation prevents straightforward analysis of its true functionality. Based on the extensive knowledge points, such behavior is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a definitive indicator of malicious activity."
