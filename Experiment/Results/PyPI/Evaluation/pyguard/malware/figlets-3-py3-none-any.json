      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive user data related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet by accessing multiple wallet-related files and configuration files from the user's AppData roaming directory and desktop/downloads/documents folders. It then compresses these files into a ZIP archive without user consent. The script gathers the current username and external IP address, constructs a message including a country flag emoji derived from the IP's country code, and sends both the message and the ZIP archive to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID via Telegram's bot API. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive wallet credentials and passphrases to an attacker-controlled server. The code operates silently without user interaction or notification, uses hardcoded attacker-controlled endpoints, and deletes the ZIP archive after sending to cover tracks. These are classic hallmarks of information-stealing malware designed to harvest cryptocurrency wallet data and exfiltrate it covertly."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive user data related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet by checking for the existence of wallet-related files and configuration files in the user's AppData roaming directory and other common user folders (Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It then archives these files into a zip file named after the user. The script gathers the current username and external IP address, constructs a message including a country flag emoji derived from the IP's country code, and sends both the message and the zip archive to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID via HTTP POST requests. This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of sensitive wallet data without user consent or notification. The use of hardcoded attacker-controlled Telegram bot credentials and the network transmission of potentially sensitive wallet files strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with credential-stealing malware. The code also attempts to clean up by deleting the zip archive after sending, further indicating stealthy exfiltration."
