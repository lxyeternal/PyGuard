      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed during the setup script execution is a classic technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the package name 'tpminepaypal' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' along with the commented suspicious URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' suggest malicious intent. The code attempts to create a directory 'tahg' as a marker to avoid repeated execution, which is a common evasion technique. Overall, the combination of obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
