      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a list of executables from a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt) and filters entries based on the current operating system. It then downloads each executable file from the same external server, writes it to the local working directory without user consent or validation, sets executable permissions on Unix-like systems, and immediately executes these downloaded binaries in the background. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: automated download and execution of potentially untrusted code from a remote source, writing executables to the current directory without user interaction, and spawning processes silently. The execute() function is called automatically before any HTTP request function (get, post, put, etc.), ensuring this malicious payload delivery and execution happens transparently whenever the module's HTTP functions are used. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or validation, and the hardcoded IP address is suspicious and not associated with known benign services. This pattern is a strong hallmark of malware that propagates or delivers payloads by fetching and running remote executables, consistent with supply chain attacks or remote code execution malware. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior."
