      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (Base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (cdnd.discordapp.com/attachments/...), which is a known vector for malware delivery. This pattern of obfuscated command execution during package setup/install is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The setup() call appears legitimate but is used as a cover to execute malicious code during installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, suspicious URL, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
