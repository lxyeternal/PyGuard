      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The presence of a suspicious comment with a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' also raise suspicion. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a package with a suspicious name 'libguiinfosuper' and author 'EsqueleSquad', which may be a disguise. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates malicious intent."
