      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior characterized by the following: It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate a URL, which decodes to an IP address with a port (http://119.8.26.163:58888/p/b66886/os11/), a suspicious and likely attacker-controlled endpoint. It collects the current system username by executing the shell command 'whoami' via os.popen, which is sensitive environment information. Immediately after, it sends this information via an HTTP POST request to the decoded remote server without any user interaction or consent. This pattern of obfuscation, environment information gathering, and silent exfiltration to a hardcoded external IP address is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with credential or environment data theft. The subsequent setuptools.setup call appears normal but is likely a cover or part of a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation or setup. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the network activity is automatic and covert. These factors combined classify the code as malicious."
