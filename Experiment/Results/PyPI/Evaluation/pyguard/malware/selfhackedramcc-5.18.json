      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and CREATE_NO_WINDOW creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating a conditional payload execution likely to evade repeated detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the obfuscated base64 string and the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip). Additionally, the setup() call uses suspicious package metadata (e.g., author 'EsqueleSquad', package name 'selfhackedramcc') which may be a disguise. The combination of obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and suspicious naming strongly aligns with known malware patterns, including supply chain attacks and remote code execution during package installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
