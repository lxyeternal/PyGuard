      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to execute hidden, potentially harmful commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands, used to evade detection and hide intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating a stealth or persistence mechanism. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with encoded commands strongly indicate malicious intent. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means the malicious payload executes automatically during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious behavior. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth execution, and execution during package installation without user consent."
