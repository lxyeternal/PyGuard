      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a hardcoded byte string. This pattern of decrypting and immediately executing code during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscated, encrypted payloads executed at install time is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. Additionally, the package name 'custojmtkinter' appears suspicious and possibly typosquatted. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks but instead runs hidden, decrypted code, which could perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, persistence, or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
