      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. First, it sends an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL with a suspicious message, which is a form of data exfiltration or signaling to an attacker-controlled endpoint. Second, it uses base64 decoding to decode a large obfuscated payload and immediately executes it with exec(), which is a classic technique for hiding malicious code and executing arbitrary commands. This decoded payload imports cryptographic libraries and executes further obfuscated code, indicating a staged payload delivery. The execution occurs during the package setup phase, which is a known supply chain attack vector allowing code execution on user systems during installation without user consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors and the lack of any legitimate user interaction or notification further confirm malicious intent. Overall, the combination of network communication to a suspicious external endpoint, obfuscated code execution, and execution during package installation strongly classifies this code as malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is highly obfuscated and uses multiple layers of base64 decoding combined with exec calls to execute dynamically decoded code. It imports the 'requests' module and performs an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is a common exfiltration technique. The code also imports cryptographic functions and performs decryption on the decoded payload before execution, indicating an attempt to hide the true payload and evade detection. The use of exec on decoded and decrypted data without any validation or user interaction is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code contacts an external server to send data, likely exfiltrating sensitive information or executing remote commands. These behaviors align with typical malware patterns such as code obfuscation, remote code execution, and data exfiltration, confirming that the code contains malicious behavior."
