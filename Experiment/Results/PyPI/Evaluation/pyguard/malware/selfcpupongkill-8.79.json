      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), which is typical for malware to avoid user awareness. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the use of a suspicious author name and email (EsqueleSquad, tahgoficial@proton.me) further indicate malicious intent. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover, as it does not relate to the subprocess execution and is wrapped in a try/except that suppresses errors. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates this code is malicious."
