      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code imports the base64 module and immediately executes a large base64-decoded string using exec. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the code. The decoded payload is not visible directly, but the pattern of base64 decoding followed by exec is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such behavior is commonly used in malware to conceal payloads, evade detection, and execute arbitrary code dynamically. The code lacks any user interaction or legitimate business logic and uses obfuscation to hide its operations, which aligns with typical malicious behaviors such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
