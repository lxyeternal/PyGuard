      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function 'hello' that executes a base64-decoded string using exec. The decoded payload imports socket, struct, and time modules, then attempts to create a socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (172.16.60.80) on port 9009. It then enters a loop receiving data, executing it as code, and sending back the output. This behavior is a classic remote code execution backdoor, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim machine remotely. The use of base64 encoding to hide the payload, immediate execution without user interaction, and network communication to a specific IP address are strong indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the code (hypotenuse and other functions) appears benign, but the presence of this backdoor code makes the overall script malicious."
