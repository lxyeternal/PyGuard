      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to execute hidden, potentially malicious PowerShell commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a known method to evade detection and hide the true intent of the command. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this hidden PowerShell process, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or unnecessary execution. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden window execution, and conditional directory checks is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware installation routines."
