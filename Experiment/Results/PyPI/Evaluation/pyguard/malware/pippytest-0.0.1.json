      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads two executable files from hardcoded, suspicious URLs hosted on Discord's CDN and saves them to a hidden system directory (C:\\$Windows.~SXK). It then executes these downloaded executables without any user interaction or consent. The directory name and file names are obfuscated and mimic system files, which is a common evasion technique. The code attempts to install the 'requests' module if missing, indicating it is designed to run in various environments. After execution, it tries to delete the directory, likely to cover tracks. This sequence of downloading untrusted executables from external URLs, saving them to a hidden system path, and executing them automatically is a classic hallmark of malware, specifically a multi-stage payload delivery and execution pattern. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the behavior is consistent with malicious activity such as remote code execution, payload deployment, or backdoor installation."
