      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It includes base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and executed dynamically via exec, which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique used by malware. The code differentiates behavior based on the operating system, with a Windows-specific payload that involves writing and executing a binary in the temporary directory, and a non-Windows payload that performs HTTP requests to suspicious endpoints, decodes and executes further code, and manipulates system and user environment data. The code also uses obfuscated imports and function names, accesses sensitive system and user information, and performs network communication to attacker-controlled domains. The presence of these patterns, combined with the execution of decoded data during package installation (setup.py), indicates a supply chain attack vector aiming for remote code execution, data exfiltration, and system compromise without user consent or interaction."
