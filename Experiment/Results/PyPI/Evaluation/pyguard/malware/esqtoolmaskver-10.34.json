      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command, the check for a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution), and the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) strongly suggest stealthy, unauthorized execution. This pattern is a well-known technique used by malware to execute payloads, perform persistence, or download and run further malicious code covertly. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during package installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
