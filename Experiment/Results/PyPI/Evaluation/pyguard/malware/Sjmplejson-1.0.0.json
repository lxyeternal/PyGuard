      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Inside this method, it checks if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is hardcoded and decrypted at install time, then executed immediately without user interaction or consent. This pattern of decrypting and executing obfuscated code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The package name 'Sjmplejson' appears to be a typo-squatted variant of a legitimate package name, which is a common tactic to trick users. The use of obfuscated, encrypted payloads executed during installation, combined with network-related imports (requests) and no legitimate business logic, strongly indicates malicious intent. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with remote code execution and supply chain attack techniques."
