      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is highly obfuscated and uses multiple layers of decoding and decompression (base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and marshal loading) to reconstruct and immediately execute code via exec. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, as it hides the true payload from static analysis and executes it dynamically at runtime. The use of exec on decompressed and unmarshalled data without any validation or user interaction strongly indicates that the code is designed to conceal and run potentially harmful or unauthorized operations. Such obfuscation and immediate execution are almost exclusively observed in malware samples and are used to evade detection, deliver payloads, or perform unauthorized actions on the host system."

This pattern is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, as it hides the true payload from static analysis and executes arbitrary code at runtime. The use of exec on decompressed and unmarshalled data without any validation or user interaction strongly indicates malicious intent. Such obfuscation and dynamic execution are almost exclusively observed in malware samples, used to evade detection and deliver harmful payloads. Given the extensive knowledge base on malicious Python code, this code matches multiple critical risk indicators, including code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and lack of transparency or legitimate purpose. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers: the code reverses a base64-encoded string, then decompresses it with zlib, unmarshals it, and finally executes it with exec. This multi-layered decoding and execution pattern is a classic hallmark of malicious code designed to evade static analysis and detection. The use of exec on dynamically decoded and unmarshaled data without any validation is a strong indicator of arbitrary code execution, which is almost exclusively observed in malware samples. The obfuscation prevents straightforward inspection of the payload, which is typical for malware aiming to conceal its true intent. Given the extensive knowledge points, such a pattern is a definitive indicator of malicious behavior, likely involving payload delivery, remote code execution, or data exfiltration. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
