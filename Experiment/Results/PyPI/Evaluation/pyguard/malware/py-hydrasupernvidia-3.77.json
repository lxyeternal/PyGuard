      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded command is base64-encoded PowerShell code, which is a well-known obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a strong indicator of stealthy, potentially malicious behavior, as it allows execution of arbitrary PowerShell commands without user visibility. Additionally, the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during the setup phase is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code executes during package installation. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation, all of which are strongly associated with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
