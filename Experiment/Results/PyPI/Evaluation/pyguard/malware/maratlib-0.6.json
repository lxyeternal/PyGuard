      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated variable and function names, including a function (l111_cringe_) that decodes and evals obfuscated strings, which is a common evasion technique. More critically, it executes shell commands via subprocess.getoutput to download a shell script from a suspicious external GitHub URL (https://github.com/nedog123/files/raw/main/aza.sh) into /tmp, sets its permissions to be fully executable (chmod 777), and immediately executes it (bash gay.sh). This sequence occurs twice, once before and once after the setuptools.setup call, indicating the code attempts to run arbitrary remote code during package installation. The use of eval on dynamically decoded strings combined with immediate execution of downloaded scripts without user consent or validation is a hallmark of malware, specifically supply chain attacks or remote code execution payload delivery. The code does not perform any legitimate package setup tasks (empty packages list) and instead focuses on executing the downloaded payload. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators such as code obfuscation, remote code download and execution, execution during package installation, and lack of user interaction or consent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
