      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads, commonly observed in malware. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the decoded command string pattern. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means the malicious payload executes automatically during package installation without user consent or interaction, a classic supply chain attack vector. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the setup call appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
