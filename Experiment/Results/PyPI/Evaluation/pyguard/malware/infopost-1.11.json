      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it runs obfuscated PowerShell code silently without user interaction or notification. The base64-encoded command is not decoded or inspected in the source, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true purpose. The subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding its execution. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts stealthy code execution during package installation or runtime. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during import or setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious payload delivery. Therefore, this code is malicious."
