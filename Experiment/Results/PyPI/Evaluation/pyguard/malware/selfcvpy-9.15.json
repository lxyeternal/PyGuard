      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, as indicated by the suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the obfuscated command. This pattern—obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup—is a classic hallmark of malware, often used in supply chain attacks to execute malicious code during installation. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script but contains this covert execution, confirming malicious intent."
