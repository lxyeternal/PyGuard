      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed conditionally based on the absence of a directory named 'tahg' suggests stealthy execution and possible persistence or payload delivery. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggest suspicious intent. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command is a classic malware technique to evade detection. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a cover or delivery mechanism. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including obfuscated command execution, stealthy background process spawning, and potential supply chain attack vector during package installation."
