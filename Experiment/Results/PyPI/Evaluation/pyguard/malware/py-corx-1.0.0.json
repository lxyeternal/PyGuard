      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary decrypted code during the package installation process on Windows systems. Specifically, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large base64-encoded payload, which is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The decrypted payload is not visible in the source, indicating obfuscation and intent to hide the true functionality. The execution occurs without user interaction or consent, during installation, which is a common vector for malware to gain code execution on victim systems. The package name and metadata appear random and meaningless, further suggesting an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code exhibits critical risk indicators of malicious intent, including obfuscated code execution during install, use of cryptographic decryption to hide payload, and execution of arbitrary code without validation or user notification."
