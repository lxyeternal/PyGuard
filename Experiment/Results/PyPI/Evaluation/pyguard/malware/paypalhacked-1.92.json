      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, indicating stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, a common malware technique to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a typical evasion or staging technique. Additionally, the setup() call uses a suspicious package name 'paypalhacked' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which are indicative of malicious intent or typosquatting. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup/install, hidden process creation, and suspicious naming strongly indicates this code is designed for malicious purposes, likely to execute unauthorized commands or payloads on the victim system without user consent."
