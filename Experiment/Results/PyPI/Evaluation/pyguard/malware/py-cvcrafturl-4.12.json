      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (Base64 encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip and the encoded command referencing a suspicious domain 'cdn.discordapp.com' and a path that looks like a payload). This pattern of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is used as a cover for executing the malicious payload during installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
