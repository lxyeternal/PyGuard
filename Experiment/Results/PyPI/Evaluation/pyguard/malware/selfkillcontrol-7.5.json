      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to execute hidden, potentially harmful commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands, used to evade detection and hide the true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is triggered during import or execution of this script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script, combined with stealth execution and conditional checks, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with malware techniques such as remote code execution, persistence, or payload delivery."
