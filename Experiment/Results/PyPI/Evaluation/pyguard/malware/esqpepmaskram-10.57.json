      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests stealth and evasion. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially harmful commands. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions, possibly downloading or executing further payloads from the suspicious domain 'dl.dropbox.com' (decoded from the base64 string). This behavior is triggered automatically during the setup process of a Python package with a suspicious name ('esqpepmaskram') and author email ('tahgoficial@proton.me'), which is typical of supply chain attacks. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, suspicious domain usage, and execution during package installation, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
