      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The encoded command references a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and downloads or executes a payload from a remote source, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious names and author information that do not correspond to legitimate software. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with spawning a hidden PowerShell process is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, or persistence. The code runs automatically during setup without user consent, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious PyPI packages."
