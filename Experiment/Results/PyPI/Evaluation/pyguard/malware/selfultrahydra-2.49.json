      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as indicated by the suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the obfuscated PowerShell command. Additionally, the setup function is used in a try-except block, which may be an attempt to mask errors or suspicious activity during package installation. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and lack of user consent or transparency is a hallmark of malware, specifically supply chain or installation-time attacks. Therefore, this code is malicious."
