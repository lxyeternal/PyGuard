      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window, CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag), which is a well-known technique used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary code without user consent or interaction. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, suggesting a conditional execution to avoid repeated infection or detection. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious comment with a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name 'selfhackedspliturl' authored by 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raise suspicion. The setup() call appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except block, possibly to suppress errors and avoid raising suspicion. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks or malware payload delivery during package installation."
