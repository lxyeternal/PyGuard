      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates stealthy execution without user notification. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggests a malicious or attacker-controlled origin. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with malware techniques such as remote code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise."
