      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before launching the command suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and may indicate a malicious actor or group. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate Python package. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script, silent background execution, and suspicious metadata strongly indicate malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware installation."
