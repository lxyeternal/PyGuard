      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string. The command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell code, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the payload, which is a typical evasion or persistence technique. This execution happens immediately upon import or setup invocation, without user interaction or notification, which is suspicious. The use of an encoded PowerShell command executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, often used for downloading or executing further payloads, privilege escalation, or persistence. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during setup strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malicious package installation behavior."
