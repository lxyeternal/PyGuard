      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running this command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the obfuscated base64 string and the commented suspicious URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip'. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation without user consent or interaction. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during installation strongly indicates malicious intent."
