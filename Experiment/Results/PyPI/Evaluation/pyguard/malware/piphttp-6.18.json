      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then launches this hidden PowerShell command, which is obfuscated via base64 encoding to hide its intent. This pattern—obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup—is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The presence of this behavior inside a setup script (which runs during package installation) indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes automatically without user consent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
