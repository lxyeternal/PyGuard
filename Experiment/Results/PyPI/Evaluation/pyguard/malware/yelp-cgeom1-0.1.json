      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that automatically collects system information such as the originating IP address, hostname, and current working directory during the package installation process. It then sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external server URL (hj4r3z33cahfqit5kmmh1mgn3e95x4lt.oastify.com) without any user interaction, consent, or notification. This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration and system fingerprinting commonly observed in supply chain attacks and malware. The use of a setuptools install hook to execute network communication during installation is a known vector for malicious code execution and information theft. There is no legitimate business logic or user benefit for this automatic data collection and transmission during installation, making this code strongly indicative of malicious intent."
