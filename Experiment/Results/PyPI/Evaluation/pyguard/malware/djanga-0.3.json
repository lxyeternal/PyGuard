      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a binary file from a hardcoded IP address (145.249.104.71) at the path '/out' without any user consent or validation. It writes this binary to a hidden file named '.drv' in the user's home directory, sets executable permissions on it, appends a command to execute this binary in the user's '.bashrc' file to ensure persistence, and immediately executes the binary. This sequence of network retrieval of an untrusted executable, silent file writing to user directories, modification of shell startup scripts for persistence, and immediate execution of the downloaded payload is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, commonly seen in malware and supply chain attacks. The code runs automatically during package setup, which means the malicious payload is deployed and executed without user interaction or notification, further confirming its malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://145.249.104.71/out) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this file to the user's home directory with a hidden or unusual filename ('.drv'), sets the file as executable, and then modifies the user's .bashrc to execute this file in the background on shell startup. This sequence of actions—silent download of a remote file, making it executable, and establishing persistence by modifying .bashrc—is a classic malware behavior pattern. The code only runs on Linux systems and exits with an error otherwise, indicating targeted malicious intent. There is no validation or user notification, and the remote file could be arbitrary code or a payload, which the user will execute unknowingly on each shell session. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns such as remote code download, persistence establishment, and stealth execution."
