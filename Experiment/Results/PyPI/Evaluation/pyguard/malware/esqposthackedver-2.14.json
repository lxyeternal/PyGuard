      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an attempt to avoid repeated execution or detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a well-known technique used in supply chain attacks and malware delivery. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup but contains this covert execution, which is a hallmark of malicious intent."
