      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent or interaction. The package name 'BeautifuoSoup' is a typo-squatted variant of a popular library, which is a common tactic in malicious packages. The obfuscated class name and encrypted payload further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. The use of exec on decrypted data during installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
