      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It performs environment checks and conditional execution based on command-line arguments. The code imports modules like pip and win32com, attempts to create and write files in user directories (e.g., using environment variables like APPDATA), and uses Windows COM interfaces to create shortcuts and execute commands. It also checks for administrative privileges and performs recursive directory walking to find and manipulate files with suspicious extensions. The obfuscation and dynamic behavior, combined with writing files to system/user directories, creating shortcuts, and executing commands during package setup, strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern matches known supply chain attacks and malware that execute code during package installation to compromise the system, exfiltrate data, or establish persistence. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior."
