      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or consent, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The package metadata uses suspicious names ('tpintpaypalcc', 'EsqueleSquad') and an email address that do not correspond to legitimate software, suggesting a typosquatted or malicious package. The presence of this code in a setup script indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation. These factors combined—obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, suspicious package metadata, and execution during installation—are strong indicators of malicious intent."
