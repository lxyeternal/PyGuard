      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' suppresses any visible window, which is a stealth technique. The encoded command itself appears to invoke 'Invoke-WebRequest' to download or execute something from a remote URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and output it to a file named '~\\WindowsCache.exe', then execute it. This behavior is consistent with downloading and executing a remote payload without user consent, a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell command execution, hidden process spawning, remote payload download and execution, and execution triggered during package setup/install time without user interaction or notification. These are strong indicators of malicious behavior."
