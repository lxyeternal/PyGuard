      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or performing system compromise. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a known hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is benign, but the subprocess call with encoded PowerShell command is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
