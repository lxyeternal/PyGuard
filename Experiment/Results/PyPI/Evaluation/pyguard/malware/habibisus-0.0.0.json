      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding, eval, and dynamic decoding techniques. It uses eval on decoded and decompressed data, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code imports modules dynamically and executes decoded payloads without any user interaction or validation. The obfuscation hides the true nature of the code, which is typical for malware attempting to evade detection. The code likely performs unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, credential theft, or remote code execution. The presence of multiple layers of decoding and execution, combined with the use of eval and exec on dynamically generated code, matches known malicious patterns including supply chain attacks and automated payload delivery. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
