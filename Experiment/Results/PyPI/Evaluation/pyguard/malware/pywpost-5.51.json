      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag further indicates stealthy execution. This pattern of executing an obfuscated PowerShell command in a hidden window during package setup is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware that executes payloads during installation without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during setup is highly suspicious and characteristic of malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
