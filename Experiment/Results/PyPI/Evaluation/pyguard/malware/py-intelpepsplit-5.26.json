      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests stealth and evasion. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially harmful commands. The encoded command likely downloads or executes further payloads from the suspicious domain 'esquelesquad.rip', which is not a known legitimate source. This behavior is triggered automatically during the setup process, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden window, conditional execution based on file existence, and suspicious domain usage strongly indicates malicious intent."
