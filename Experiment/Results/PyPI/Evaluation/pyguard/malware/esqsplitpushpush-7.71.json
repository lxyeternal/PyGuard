      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealth execution. The PowerShell command is passed as a long base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a common obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the command. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then executes this hidden PowerShell command, which downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious GitHub URL (https://github.com/T4hg/ee/raw/master/Starter1.exe). This behavior is characteristic of malware performing a staged payload download and execution without user consent or notification. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these factors combined strongly indicate that this code is malicious."
