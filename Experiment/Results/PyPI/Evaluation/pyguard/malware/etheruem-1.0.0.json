      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded Fernet key. This pattern of decrypting and immediately executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated, encrypted payloads executed at install time without user interaction or consent strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the package name 'etheruem' is suspiciously similar to 'ethereum', suggesting possible typosquatting. The code also requests installation of 'fernet' and 'requests' packages, which are used in the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful code during installation, which is a critical risk indicator of malware."
