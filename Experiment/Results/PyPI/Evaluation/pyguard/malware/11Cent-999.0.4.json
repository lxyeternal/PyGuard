      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install process to execute code automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. It collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It attempts to create a file in the /root directory and lists contents of sensitive directories such as '/', '/root/', '/home/', and '/root/.ssh/'. This directory listing includes potentially sensitive files like SSH keys. The collected data is then silently exfiltrated via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://j0j0.xyz/lists/'). This behavior—automatic execution during install, collection of sensitive system and user data, and exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server—is a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks and data-stealing malware. There is no legitimate user interaction, notification, or business logic justifying these actions, and the use of root directory access attempts further indicates malicious intent."
