      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates stealthy execution without user notification. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' adds to the suspicion. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, which is typical in malicious packages to hide errors and ensure execution. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, conditional execution based on file system state, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware payload delivery during package installation."
