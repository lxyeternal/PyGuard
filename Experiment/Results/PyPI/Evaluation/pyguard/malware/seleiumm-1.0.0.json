      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded Fernet key. This pattern of decrypting and immediately executing code during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The package name 'seleiumm' appears to be a typo-squatted variant of 'selenium', which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The use of obfuscated class names and encrypted payload further supports the intent to evade detection. The code executes this payload silently during installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate reason for executing decrypted arbitrary code during install, especially without user notification. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with malware that performs remote code execution and potentially further malicious actions on Windows systems."
