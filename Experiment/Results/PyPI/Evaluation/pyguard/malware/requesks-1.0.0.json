      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary decrypted code during package installation on Windows systems. Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key and immediately executes it with exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The package name 'requesks' is suspiciously similar to 'requests', indicating possible typosquatting. The encrypted payload is not visible in plaintext, preventing static analysis of its behavior, but the use of exec on decrypted data without user consent or validation is a critical risk. The code runs automatically during installation without user interaction, contacts external modules, and executes hidden code, all consistent with malicious intent."
