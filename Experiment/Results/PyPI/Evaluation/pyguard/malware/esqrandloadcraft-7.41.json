      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated PowerShell payloads. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then launches this hidden PowerShell command, which likely performs unauthorized actions without user consent or notification. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command further supports the malicious intent. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious code during package installation. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful commands on the victim's system."
