      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed during the setup script phase, combined with the check for the existence of a suspicious directory ('tahg'), suggests stealthy execution of potentially harmful code. The comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports malicious intent. This pattern—obfuscated command execution via PowerShell spawned silently during package setup—is a well-known technique used in malware for stealthy code execution, persistence, or payload delivery. The rest of the setup code appears benign, but the subprocess call with encoded PowerShell command is a critical risk indicator of malicious activity."
