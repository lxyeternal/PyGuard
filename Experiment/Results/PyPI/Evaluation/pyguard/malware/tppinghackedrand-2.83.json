      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command and execute it stealthily without user interaction or notification. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands, and the command string references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and attempts to execute a file named WindowsCache.exe, indicating a likely download and execution of a malicious payload. The presence of a directory existence check for 'tahg' before launching the process suggests an evasion or staging technique. The package metadata includes suspicious author information ('EsqueleSquad') and a suspicious package name ('tppinghackedrand'), which may be typosquatting or misleading. The subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide the window, further indicating stealthy execution. These behaviors align strongly with known malware patterns such as obfuscated code execution, stealthy payload delivery, and potential remote code execution during package installation, which are hallmark indicators of malicious activity."
