      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (# www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated command string. This execution happens automatically during the setup script execution without user interaction or consent. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The package name and author information appear suspicious and may be used for a supply chain attack. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, and automatic execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
