      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or consent, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the payload if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade detection or repeated runs. The hardcoded URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the suspicious package name 'esqnvidiamaskvirtual' further suggest malicious intent. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors and the execution of code during the setup process (package installation) are classic supply chain attack vectors. Overall, the combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during package installation strongly indicates malicious intent."
