      "malicious_behavior": "The code spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command, combined with spawning a hidden shell process, is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The rest of the code is a setup call for a package named 'hackedpost' with suspicious author information, which may be a disguise or part of a supply chain attack. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup, without any legitimate user interaction or clear benign purpose, strongly indicates malicious intent."
