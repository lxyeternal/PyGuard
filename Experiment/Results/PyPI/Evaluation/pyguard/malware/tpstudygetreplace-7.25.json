      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindoCache.exe'. This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution combined with downloading and running an executable from a non-official, suspicious URL is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy payload delivery, persistence, or remote code execution. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. The presence of try/except blocks suppressing errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is malicious and designed to execute a hidden payload from a remote source without user consent."
