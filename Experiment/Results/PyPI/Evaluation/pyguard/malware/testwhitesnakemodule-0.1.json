      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically via exec(), which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique used by malware. The code runs automatically during package installation (outside of 'sdist' argument), which is a known supply chain attack vector. It performs environment reconnaissance, collects sensitive system and user information, and attempts to exfiltrate data to hardcoded suspicious external servers. The code also spawns subprocesses with obfuscated PowerShell commands, uses threading for stealthy execution, and writes files to system or user directories without user consent. The presence of encoded URLs, suspicious domain names, and automated network communication further confirm its malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily collect, exfiltrate sensitive data, and execute arbitrary code on the victim system, consistent with credential stealing and remote code execution malware."
