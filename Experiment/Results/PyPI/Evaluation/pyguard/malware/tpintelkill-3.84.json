      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (# www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated command string. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic supply chain attack technique to execute malicious code on the victim's system without user consent or awareness. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup call, likely used as a cover. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Therefore, this code is malicious."
