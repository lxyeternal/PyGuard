      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary decrypted code during package installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a base64-encoded payload, which is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated encrypted payloads executed during installation, combined with network-related imports (requests) and no legitimate business logic, strongly indicates that the package is designed to run hidden malicious code on the victim's machine during installation. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as code obfuscation, dynamic code execution during install, and potential remote code execution, all of which are typical in malware and supply chain attacks."
