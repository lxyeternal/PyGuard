      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the use of a non-standard package name ('esqvmmineping') with an author email that does not correspond to a known legitimate source further indicate malicious intent. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during package setup strongly aligns with known malware supply chain attack patterns."
