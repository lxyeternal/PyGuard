      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (\"https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm...\"), which is a known vector for downloading or executing remote payloads. The presence of this obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during the setup phase of a Python package (with a suspicious package name 'py-supergetnvidia' and author 'EsqueleSquad') strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery. The try/except blocks suppress errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, use of suspicious external URLs, and execution during package installation, all of which are hallmark behaviors of malicious code."
