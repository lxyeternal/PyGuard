      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during the setup process, combined with the suspicious package name 'tpintelcpuver' and author information linked to 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', strongly suggests this is a supply chain attack or malware installation vector. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command and the lack of any legitimate user interaction or notification further confirm malicious intent. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware that executes hidden payloads during package installation or setup, aiming for stealthy code execution and potential further compromise."
