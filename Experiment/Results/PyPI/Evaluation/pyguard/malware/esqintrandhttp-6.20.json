      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command, the check for a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution), and the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) strongly suggest stealthy, unauthorized code execution. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware that attempts to execute hidden payloads or perform unauthorized actions during package installation or execution. The rest of the code is a setup call that appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except to suppress errors, which is common in malicious setup scripts to avoid detection. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
