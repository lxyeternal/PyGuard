      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to execute hidden, potentially harmful commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is a known method to hide the true intent of the command. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The presence of a suspicious comment with a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code attempts to run a standard setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is executed silently and independently of the setup logic. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package installation is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. Therefore, the code is malicious."
