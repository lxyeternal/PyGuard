      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands, and the process is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. This behavior is strongly associated with malicious activity, such as stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The rest of the setup call appears normal but is wrapped in a try/except pass block, which suppresses errors and may hide malicious failures. Taken together, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup, conditional on the absence of a specific directory, is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
