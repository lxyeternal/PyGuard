      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (cdnd.discordapp.com/attachments/...), which is a known vector for malware delivery. This pattern of obfuscated command execution during package setup/install is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell command during import or setup is malicious. Therefore, this code is malicious."
