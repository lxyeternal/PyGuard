      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This obfuscation technique (base64-encoded PowerShell command) is a classic hallmark of malware attempting stealthy execution. The command is executed without user interaction or notification, in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), which is typical for covert operations. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup call for a package with a suspicious name ('tpgameurl') and author, which is likely a disguise for the malicious payload. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates this code is malicious."
