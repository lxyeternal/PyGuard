      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification, and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide its execution. The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or performing system compromise. Additionally, the package metadata references 'EsqueleSquad' and an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which along with the obfuscated PowerShell command and hidden execution, strongly suggests malicious intent. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a known supply chain attack vector and is almost exclusively observed in malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
