      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking a web request to a suspicious URL (noted in the comment as www.esquelesquad.rip) or executing further payloads. This execution happens automatically during the import/setup phase without user interaction or consent. The presence of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently in the background is a hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or payload delivery. Additionally, the package name and author information appear suspicious and may be typosquatted or maliciously crafted. The try/except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious intent."
