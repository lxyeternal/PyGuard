      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded Fernet key. This pattern of decrypting and immediately executing code during package installation is a hallmark of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The package name 'pthon' is suspiciously similar to 'python' (typosquatting), which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscated class names and the execution of hidden payloads during install time strongly indicate a supply chain attack vector designed to run malicious code on Windows systems when the package is installed. There is no legitimate reason for executing decrypted arbitrary code during installation, especially without user notification or validation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
