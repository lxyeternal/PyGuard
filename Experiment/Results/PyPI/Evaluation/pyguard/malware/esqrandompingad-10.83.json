      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' in a hidden manner. This pattern of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and remote code retrieval is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy payload delivery, persistence, or further exploitation. Additionally, the package metadata and author information appear suspicious and unrelated to any known legitimate package, further supporting the malicious intent. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors also indicates an attempt to evade detection or analysis."
