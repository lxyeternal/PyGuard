      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a Base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the 'Hidden' window style and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the embedded URL-like string in the comment and the encoded command itself. This execution happens automatically during the setup script execution without any user interaction or notification, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware embedded in Python packages. The presence of obfuscation (Base64 encoding), hidden process execution, and the suspicious domain in the comment further support the conclusion that this code is malicious."
