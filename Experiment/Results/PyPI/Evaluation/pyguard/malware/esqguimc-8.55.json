      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The PowerShell command runs in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden) and uses the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to suppress any console window, which is typical for stealthy execution. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, and conditional execution during package setup strongly indicates this code is designed for malicious purposes, such as executing hidden payloads or establishing persistence during package installation."
