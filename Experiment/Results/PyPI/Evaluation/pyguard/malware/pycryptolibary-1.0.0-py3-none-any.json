      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It collects extensive sensitive data from the victim's system, including browser cookies, saved passwords, credit card information, Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Minecraft files, and system information such as Windows keys, hardware IDs, IP address, and geolocation. The code decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows APIs and AES decryption, indicating intent to extract protected credentials. It also monitors and manipulates the clipboard to replace cryptocurrency wallet addresses with attacker-controlled addresses, a known clipboard hijacking technique to steal cryptocurrency. The malware attempts to evade detection by checking for virtual machine environments, blacklisted usernames, and processes related to debugging or analysis tools, and can kill Discord-related processes to avoid interference. It exfiltrates all collected data and screenshots to attacker-controlled Discord webhooks and uploads archives of stolen data to external servers. The code runs stealthily without user interaction, installs itself to startup folders for persistence, and uses threading to perform background data collection and exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded suspicious URLs (e.g., kekwltd.ru), use of obfuscated variable names, and automated installation of numerous Python packages further support malicious intent. Overall, this code is a sophisticated credential stealer and spyware designed to silently harvest and exfiltrate sensitive user data and credentials."
