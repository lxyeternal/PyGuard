      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated class name and the use of encrypted code executed during installation strongly indicate an attempt to hide malicious payload delivery and execution. The package name 'customekinter' and the nonsensical description strings further suggest obfuscation and evasion. Overall, this code enables remote code execution during package installation on Windows systems, which is a critical security risk and a strong indicator of malware."
