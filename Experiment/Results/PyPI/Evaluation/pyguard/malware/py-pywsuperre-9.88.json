      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (Base64 encoded). The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (cdnd.discordapp.com) and downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' in a hidden manner. The presence of a directory existence check ('tahg') before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. The use of obfuscated (Base64) commands, hidden execution, and a suspicious external URL combined with execution during package setup strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malware payload delivery. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, hidden PowerShell invocation, and execution during package installation, all of which are hallmark behaviors of malicious code."
