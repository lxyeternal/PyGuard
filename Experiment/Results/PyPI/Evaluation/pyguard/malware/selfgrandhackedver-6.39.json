      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background if the directory 'tahg' does not exist, indicating stealthy behavior. The presence of a suspicious comment with a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide the window is a known malware technique to evade detection. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a package with suspicious naming ('selfgrandhackedver') and author information matching the suspicious domain, which is typical of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth execution, suspicious naming, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
