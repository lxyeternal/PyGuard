      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command, the use of subprocess to execute it stealthily, and the check for a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution) are classic signs of malware attempting to execute obfuscated payloads. Additionally, the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggest malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup call that appears benign but is wrapped in a try-except to suppress errors, which is a common evasion technique. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates malicious behavior."
