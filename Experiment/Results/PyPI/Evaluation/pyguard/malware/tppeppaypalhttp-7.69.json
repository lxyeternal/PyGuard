      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded command is executed without user interaction or notification, and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide its execution. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports malicious intent. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during the setup process is a classic technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the package name 'tppeppaypalhttp' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and potentially typosquatted or attacker-controlled. The overall pattern matches known malware behaviors involving obfuscation, stealth execution, and potential supply chain attack vectors during package installation."
