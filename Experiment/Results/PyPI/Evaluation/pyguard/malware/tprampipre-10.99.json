      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command suggests an evasion or staging technique. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further indicate suspicious origins. The use of distutils setup with a suspicious package name 'tprampipre' and author 'EsqueleSquad' is consistent with supply chain attack patterns where malicious code is executed during package installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy subprocess creation, and suspicious package metadata strongly indicates malicious behavior."
