      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded command is executed without user interaction or notification, and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide its execution. The presence of a suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated PowerShell command strongly suggest stealthy, unauthorized activity. The code attempts to create a directory named 'tahg' if it does not exist, likely as a marker or staging area. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during the setup phase is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for persistence, payload delivery, or further exploitation. The rest of the code is a typical setup call, but the hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell command during import or installation is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
