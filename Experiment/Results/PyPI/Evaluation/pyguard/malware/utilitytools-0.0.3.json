      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded external URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe) and immediately executes it without any user interaction, validation, or consent. This pattern of downloading and running an executable from an untrusted remote source is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The use of subprocess.Popen to run the downloaded executable further confirms the intent to execute potentially harmful code. There is no integrity check, no user notification, and no legitimate business logic justifying this behavior. Such automated retrieval and execution of untrusted binaries is a classic malware propagation and payload delivery technique."
