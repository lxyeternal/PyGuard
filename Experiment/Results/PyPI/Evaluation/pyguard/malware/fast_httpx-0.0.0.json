      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding, eval, and decode operations, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The code dynamically imports modules and executes decoded payloads without any user interaction or validation. It uses eval on decoded data, which is a critical risk indicator for arbitrary code execution. The presence of multiple layers of decoding and execution, combined with obfuscated variable and function names, strongly suggests malicious intent. The code likely performs unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, environment reconnaissance, or remote code execution. These behaviors align with known malware patterns, including supply chain attacks and credential theft, as described in the knowledge points. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
