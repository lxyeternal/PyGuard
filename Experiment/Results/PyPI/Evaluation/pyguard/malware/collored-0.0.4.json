      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable binary from a remote URL obtained dynamically from a hardcoded suspicious URL (https://rentry.co/2sv84/raw). It saves this binary to a user-specific temporary directory without any user consent or notification, then executes it silently using a shell command. The use of threading to run this sequence in the background further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This pattern—fetching a remote payload, writing it to a temporary location, and executing it without validation or user interaction—is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for payload delivery, persistence, or remote code execution. The hardcoded external URL, lack of integrity checks, and automatic execution of downloaded code strongly indicate malicious intent."
