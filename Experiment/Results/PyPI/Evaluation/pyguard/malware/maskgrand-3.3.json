      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell command execution during the setup phase (package installation) is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, the hidden execution, and the execution triggered automatically during package setup strongly indicate malicious intent, such as downloading or executing further payloads, privilege escalation, or stealthy code execution. The rest of the setup code appears benign, but the embedded subprocess call with obfuscated PowerShell command is a critical risk indicator of malware."
