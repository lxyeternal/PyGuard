      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It extensively uses obfuscation techniques, including multiple layers of base64 and base16 decoding combined with marshal deserialization and zlib decompression, followed by immediate execution via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of malware attempting to conceal its true functionality and evade static analysis. The code imports numerous modules commonly used in malicious scripts (e.g., requests, telethon, marshal, base64, zlib) and executes large blocks of obfuscated code without any user interaction or validation. The presence of asynchronous functions handling events with obfuscated payloads, sending files, and deleting messages suggests automated, stealthy operations typical of malware or backdoors. The code also references Telegram client libraries, indicating potential use for command and control or data exfiltration via Telegram. The combination of these factors—heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution from decoded payloads, network communication capabilities, and lack of legitimate application logic—confirms that this code is malicious."
