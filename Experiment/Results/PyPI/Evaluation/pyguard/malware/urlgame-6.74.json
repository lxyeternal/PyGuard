      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or unnecessary runs. The PowerShell command is executed with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, a typical stealth technique. This behavior is embedded in a setup script, meaning it executes during package installation, a known vector for supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands, hidden execution, and execution during installation strongly indicates malicious intent, as these patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or payload delivery. The rest of the setup code appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
