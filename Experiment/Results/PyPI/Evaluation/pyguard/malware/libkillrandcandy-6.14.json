      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The PowerShell command is run with the window style set to hidden and uses the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads from a suspicious domain (noted in the comment as www.esquelesquad.rip). This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered during import or setup is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
