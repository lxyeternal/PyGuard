      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a base64-encoded and Fernet-encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package supply chain attacks. The code executes arbitrary, obfuscated code without user consent or interaction during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, system compromise, or further payload delivery. The package name 'PyGamne' appears suspicious and the description and long description are nonsensical, which are common indicators of typosquatting or malicious packages. The use of 'setup_requires' to install 'fernet' and 'requests' also supports the intent to execute network-related or cryptographic operations. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated payload execution during installation, use of cryptographic decryption to hide payload, and execution of arbitrary code with no user interaction."
