      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated class name and encrypted payload hide the true intent of the code, which is executed silently during package installation. The use of exec on decrypted data, combined with network-related imports and execution triggered during setup install, strongly indicates remote code execution capability and potential further malicious actions. This behavior is not typical or necessary for legitimate packages and matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, execution of hidden payloads during install, and lack of transparency or user consent."
