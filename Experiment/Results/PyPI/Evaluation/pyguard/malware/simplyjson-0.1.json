      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive user data. It collects environment information such as IP address and username, then extracts Discord tokens from various browser and Discord client storage locations by reading local files and decrypting stored credentials using Windows DPAPI. It also extracts saved passwords and cookies from Chromium-based browsers by copying and reading SQLite databases, decrypting encrypted values with the local master key. The code collects additional user information such as billing info, badges, and friends from Discord API using stolen tokens. It uploads all stolen data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating sensitive credentials and personal information to an attacker-controlled server. The code uses threading to perform concurrent data collection and zips various wallet, gaming, and app data for exfiltration. It also searches user folders for files with keywords related to passwords and accounts, uploading them to anonymous file hosting services. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook, automated extraction and decryption of sensitive credentials, silent network exfiltration, and no user consent or notification are definitive indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
