      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests stealth and evasion. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially harmful commands. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, given the presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated command string. This behavior is triggered automatically during the setup script execution, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden window creation, conditional execution based on file system state, and the suspicious domain reference strongly indicate malicious intent."
