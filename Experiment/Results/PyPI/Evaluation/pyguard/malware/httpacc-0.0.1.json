      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the PC username (extracted from the home directory path), the MAC address, and the public IP address. It then queries a geolocation API (ip-api.com) to gather detailed location and network information about the IP address. All this collected data is formatted and sent via an HTTP POST request to a remote webhook URL that is base64-encoded and decoded at runtime. The webhook URL (decoded from base64) points to an external, non-standard domain (dude.ong), which is suspicious and likely attacker-controlled. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent involved in this data collection and exfiltration process. The use of base64 encoding to hide the webhook URL is a common obfuscation technique in malware to evade detection. The overall behavior matches typical malicious patterns of automated system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to a remote server without user knowledge or legitimate purpose."
