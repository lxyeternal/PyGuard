      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a known obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to run silently in the background. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further supports suspicion. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is triggered during import or execution of this script, which is a common supply chain attack vector. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup/install is a strong indicator of malicious behavior."
