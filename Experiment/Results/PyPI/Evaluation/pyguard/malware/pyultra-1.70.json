      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed during the setup script execution is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading and executing further payloads. The directory existence check for 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup call, likely used as a disguise or to facilitate installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
