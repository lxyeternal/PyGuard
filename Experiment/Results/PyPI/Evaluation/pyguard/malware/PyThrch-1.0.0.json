      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The obfuscated class name and the use of encrypted code executed during installation strongly indicate a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. The code does not perform any legitimate installation tasks before executing this hidden payload, which likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading further malware, exfiltrating data, or compromising the system. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
