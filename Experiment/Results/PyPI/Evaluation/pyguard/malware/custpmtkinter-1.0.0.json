      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted code execution during package installation, and the lack of any legitimate user interaction or notification strongly indicate that this code is designed to execute hidden malicious payloads on the victim's machine during package installation. Such behavior is not typical or necessary for benign packages and is a critical risk indicator of malware."
