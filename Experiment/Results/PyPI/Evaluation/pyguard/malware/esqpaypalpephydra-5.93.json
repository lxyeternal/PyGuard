      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution, the use of a hidden PowerShell window, and the encoded command strongly indicate stealthy, potentially harmful behavior. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious names ('esqpaypalpephydra', 'EsqueleSquad') and an unusual author email, which may be typosquatting or misleading. The combination of obfuscated command execution during package setup/install and the use of hidden PowerShell processes is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
