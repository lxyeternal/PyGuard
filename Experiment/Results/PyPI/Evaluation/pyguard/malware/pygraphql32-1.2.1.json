      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file named 'image.png' from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://wpp-api-01hw.onrender.com/api/images/1140884481671188581/image.png) into the user's APPDATA directory without any user interaction or consent. It then reads the content of this file, decodes it from base64, and immediately executes it using exec(). This pattern of fetching remote code, decoding it, and executing it dynamically is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The use of environment variables to determine the file path, the lack of validation or sanitization of the downloaded content, and the silent execution in a loop with retry logic further indicate an attempt to persistently execute potentially harmful code. The rest of the code defines a proxy management class that facilitates HTTP requests through authenticated proxies, which could be used to evade detection or perform further network-based malicious activities. Overall, the combination of remote code download, base64 decoding, and immediate execution without user consent or validation is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
