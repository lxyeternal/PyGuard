      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it collects sensitive environment information such as the hostname, current working directory, and username without user consent. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io), which is a known attacker-controlled domain used for out-of-band interaction and data exfiltration. This behavior is a classic example of a supply chain attack where malicious code is executed during package installation to silently collect and exfiltrate system information. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of a custom install hook to perform network communication to an attacker-controlled server during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
