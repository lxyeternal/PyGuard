      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that, during installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. It immediately executes the decrypted payload via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The encrypted payload is not visible in plaintext, indicating obfuscation to hide the true nature of the executed code. The use of exec on decrypted data during installation is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. Additionally, the package name and metadata appear suspicious and obfuscated, further supporting malicious intent. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior by executing hidden, decrypted code during package installation on Windows systems."
