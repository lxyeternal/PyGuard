      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, further indicating stealthy execution. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) also suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is executed before it, during import or setup. This pattern of executing obfuscated PowerShell commands in a hidden window during package setup is a known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
