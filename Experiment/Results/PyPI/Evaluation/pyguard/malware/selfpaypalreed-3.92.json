      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the use of a hidden PowerShell window strongly indicate stealthy, potentially malicious behavior. Additionally, the setup() call with a suspicious package name ('selfpaypalreed') and author information referencing 'EsqueleSquad' and an email address that does not correspond to a known legitimate source further supports suspicion. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth execution flags (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), and lack of legitimate business logic or user consent is a hallmark of malware, likely designed for remote code execution, persistence, or payload delivery during package installation."
