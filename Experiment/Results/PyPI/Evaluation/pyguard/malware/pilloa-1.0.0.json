      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class GruppeInstall that overrides the install command in setuptools. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec on the output of Fernet decryption with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This decrypted code is not visible in the source, indicating obfuscation and dynamic code execution. Executing decrypted code during package installation without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The use of Fernet decryption to hide the payload, combined with immediate execution during install, strongly indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name and metadata appear random and meaningless, which is common in malicious or typosquatted packages. There is no legitimate reason for executing decrypted code during installation, especially without user notification or validation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with known malware patterns involving obfuscated payload delivery and execution during package installation."
