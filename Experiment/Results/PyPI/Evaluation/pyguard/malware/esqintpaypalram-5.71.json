      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated (base64-encoded UTF-16LE) and executed without user interaction or notification. The command references a suspicious GitHub URL (github.com/T4Hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe), indicating it likely downloads and executes a remote payload. The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The package name 'esqintpaypalram' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and unrelated to the described functionality. The code runs this potentially malicious payload during the setup process, which is a common supply chain attack vector. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated command execution, remote payload retrieval, stealth execution, and execution during package installation without user consent."
