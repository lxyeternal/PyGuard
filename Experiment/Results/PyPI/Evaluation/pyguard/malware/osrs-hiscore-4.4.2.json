      "malicious_behavior": "The code hooks into the setuptools installation process to execute a function 'send' immediately upon package installation without any user interaction or consent. This function collects the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' (host identifier) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php'. Then, if the platform is Windows ('win32'), it downloads an executable file from another suspicious URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', saves it locally as 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe', and executes it silently using 'os.system' with the 'start' command. This sequence of environment data exfiltration combined with downloading and executing an untrusted binary during package installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The absence of any user notification, validation, or legitimate business logic, the use of hardcoded suspicious domains, and the automatic execution of a downloaded executable file strongly indicate malicious intent."
