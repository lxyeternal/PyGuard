      "malicious_behavior": "The code extracts saved Chrome browser passwords by accessing the local Chrome 'Login Data' SQLite database and decrypting stored passwords using Windows DPAPI and Chrome's AES encryption key. It collects sensitive user credentials (website URLs, usernames, and decrypted passwords) without user consent. The script writes these credentials to a local file 'passwords.txt' and then exfiltrates this file by sending it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is attacker-controlled. This automated collection and exfiltration of sensitive credential data without user interaction or notification is a hallmark of credential-stealing malware. The use of Windows-specific decryption APIs, direct access to browser data, and network transmission to a hardcoded external endpoint confirms malicious intent."
