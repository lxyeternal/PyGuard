      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during the setup process is a hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading and executing further payloads. Additionally, the package name 'py-adrehacked' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' and the commented suspicious URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' further suggest malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup call but is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, which is also suspicious. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during installation, a classic supply chain attack vector."
