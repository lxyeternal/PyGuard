      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during the setup phase, combined with the suspicious domain comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the use of a suspicious package name 'libvisastr' with author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', strongly suggests this is a supply chain attack or malware. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or data exfiltration. This pattern—obfuscated command execution via PowerShell spawned silently during package setup—is a well-known hallmark of malicious Python packages and supply chain attacks."
