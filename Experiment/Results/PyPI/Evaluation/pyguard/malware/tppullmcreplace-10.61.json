      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or exfiltrating data. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks. The rest of the code (setup call) appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Therefore, this code is malicious."
