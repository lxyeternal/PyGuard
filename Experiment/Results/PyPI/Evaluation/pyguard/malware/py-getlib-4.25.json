      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a stealth or persistence check to avoid repeated execution. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, ensuring it runs silently without user notification. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or delivery mechanism. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup, without user interaction or consent, is a hallmark of malware, specifically a supply chain attack or installer-based payload execution."
