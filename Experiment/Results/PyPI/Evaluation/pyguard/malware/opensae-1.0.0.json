      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec on the output of Fernet decryption with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This pattern of decrypting and immediately executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated encrypted payloads executed at install time without user interaction or consent strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the package name and metadata appear obfuscated and suspicious. The code leverages setuptools install hooks to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine during installation, which is a critical risk vector for malware delivery and remote code execution."
