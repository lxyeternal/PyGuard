      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed during the setup script execution is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. The directory existence check for 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The use of a suspicious package name ('esqsplithttpmc') and author email ('tahgoficial@proton.me') further supports the suspicion. Overall, this pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
