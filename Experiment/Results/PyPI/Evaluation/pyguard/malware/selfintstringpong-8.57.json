      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip), which is not a known or trusted source. This pattern of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and remote command execution during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a package with suspicious author and package names, which further supports the malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute potentially harmful commands on the victim's system during package installation, which is a critical risk behavior."
