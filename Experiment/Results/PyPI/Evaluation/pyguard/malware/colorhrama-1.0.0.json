      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary decrypted code during package installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large encrypted payload and immediately executes it with exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, commonly seen in supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscation (encrypted payload), dynamic code execution (exec on decrypted data), and execution triggered automatically during package installation strongly indicates malicious intent. The package metadata fields (name, description, author) appear random or meaningless, which is typical for malicious or typosquatted packages. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code runs silently in the background during installation. These factors combined confirm that the code contains malicious behavior."
