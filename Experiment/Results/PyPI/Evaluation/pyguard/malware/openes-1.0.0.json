      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' module and a 'Fernet' class from a module named 'fernet'. It then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in supply chain attacks. The code executes arbitrary, obfuscated payloads without user consent or interaction during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, system compromise, or data exfiltration. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during install strongly indicate malicious intent."
