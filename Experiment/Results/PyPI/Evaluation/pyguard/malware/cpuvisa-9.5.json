      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The use of subprocess to spawn PowerShell with an encoded command in a hidden window is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
