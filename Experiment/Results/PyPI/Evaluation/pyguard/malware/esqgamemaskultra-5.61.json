      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking a web request to a suspicious URL (notably 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0'), which suggests downloading or executing a payload from an external source. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to download and execute additional malicious payloads silently. The presence of this code in a setup script further indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) and hidden execution, combined with the suspicious URL and lack of any legitimate user interaction or notification, confirms the code is malicious."
