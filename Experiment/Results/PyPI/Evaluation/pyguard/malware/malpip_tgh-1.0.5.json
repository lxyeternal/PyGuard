      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a function 'mal' that retrieves the current user's login name and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'lqprfk1g9i68xn4f.b.requestbin.net', which is likely attacker-controlled. Immediately after, it creates a TCP socket connection to a hardcoded IP address '194.233.164.169' on port 1337 and redirects the standard input/output/error file descriptors to this socket, then spawns a shell ('sh') attached to this socket. This effectively establishes a reverse shell, allowing remote command execution on the victim's machine. Furthermore, this malicious function is automatically invoked during the package installation process by overriding the setuptools 'install' command, meaning the malicious payload executes without user consent or interaction during installation. The package metadata itself is suspicious, with the author named 'Malicious Actor' and a description indicating it is a test package to demonstrate malicious pip packages. These behaviors—automatic execution during install, exfiltration of user information, and establishing a reverse shell—are hallmark indicators of malware and supply chain attacks."
