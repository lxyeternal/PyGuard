      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to facilitate installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window, lack of user interaction, and suspicious naming strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with malware or a supply chain attack."
