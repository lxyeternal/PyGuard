      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string using subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated in base64 Unicode format, which is a common method to hide the true intent of the command. The command references a suspicious GitHub URL (github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and executes a file named Stage1.exe, indicating it downloads and runs a potentially malicious payload without user consent or interaction. This behavior is typical of malware that uses obfuscation and hidden execution to deliver and run secondary payloads, often as part of a supply chain attack or initial infection vector. The presence of this code in a setup script further suggests it is designed to execute automatically during package installation, a known vector for malicious code execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
