      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64 encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an attempt to avoid repeated execution or detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as downloading or executing further payloads, or performing system compromise. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. The package metadata also contains suspicious author information and a suspicious package name, which further supports the malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
