      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated in base64, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of an obfuscated PowerShell command strongly indicate malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and execution during package setup is a strong indicator of malware."
