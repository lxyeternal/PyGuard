      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It conditionally executes code based on command-line arguments and platform checks. The code imports modules like pip and win32com, attempts to create and write files in user directories (e.g., using environment variables like APPDATA), and uses COM objects to create and save shortcuts. It also performs directory walking and file operations with suspicious filename patterns. The obfuscation and dynamic behavior strongly suggest attempts to evade detection. The code appears to execute arbitrary commands and manipulate system files during package setup, which is a known supply chain attack vector. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators of malicious activity, including code execution during installation, environment reconnaissance, file system manipulation, and potential persistence mechanisms. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
