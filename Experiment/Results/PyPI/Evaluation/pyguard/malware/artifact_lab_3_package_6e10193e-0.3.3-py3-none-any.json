      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code implements a reverse shell, which is a classic malicious behavior. It creates a socket connection to a hardcoded external server (8.tcp.ngrok.io on port 14060) and redirects the standard input, output, and error file descriptors to this socket. Then it spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i) connected to this socket, effectively allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim machine. This behavior enables unauthorized remote control and is a strong indicator of malware, specifically a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate business logic, and the code is designed to stealthily provide remote shell access, which is a critical risk and unequivocally malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It automatically collects all environment variables from the host system and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (a ngrok domain controlled by an attacker) without any user interaction or consent, which constitutes data exfiltration of potentially sensitive information. Additionally, it defines a reverse shell function that, if enabled, would connect back to an attacker-controlled server and spawn an interactive shell, allowing remote command execution and full control over the victim system. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled network endpoints, automatic environment variable exfiltration on script execution, and the reverse shell capability are strong indicators of malicious intent and behavior consistent with remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors."
