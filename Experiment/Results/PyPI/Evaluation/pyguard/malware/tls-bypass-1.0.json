      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a temporary Python script that contains a command to download and execute code directly from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/cry6n/raw) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. This dynamic retrieval and execution of remote code without any validation or user consent is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. Furthermore, the script then attempts to execute this temporary file in a new Python process using a system call with 'start' on Windows, which runs the code in the background without user interaction or notification. This pattern of downloading and executing arbitrary code during package setup is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The use of obfuscated variable names, temporary file creation, and immediate execution of remote code during installation further confirms the malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a standard setuptools setup script, and it poses a critical security risk."
