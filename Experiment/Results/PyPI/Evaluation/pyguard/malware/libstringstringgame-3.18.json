      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a persistence or evasion mechanism. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further supports malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or delivery mechanism. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and lack of legitimate user interaction or business logic classifies this code as malicious."
