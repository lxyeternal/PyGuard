      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command with encoded payload and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag indicates stealthy execution without user notification. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is executed before it, during import or setup invocation. This pattern of executing obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup is a known supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and potentially further payload delivery or system compromise. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, conditional execution to evade detection, and execution during package installation."
