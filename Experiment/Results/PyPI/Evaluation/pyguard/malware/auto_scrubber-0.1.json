      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. Specifically, it hooks into the setuptools install command to run code automatically during package installation without user consent. It uses obfuscated byte arrays and a custom generator function to decode and XOR-decrypt hardcoded data, which is then used to construct URLs dynamically based on the platform architecture. The code performs an HTTP GET request to a remote URL (decoded at runtime) to download a binary payload, which it then XOR-decrypts and writes to a hidden directory (~/.local/bin/AutoScrub) with executable permissions. Immediately after writing, it silently executes this binary in the background, suppressing all output. The install hook also scans certain user directories (decoded from obfuscated paths) and, upon matching a specific condition, triggers the payload download and execution. This pattern of obfuscation, remote payload retrieval, silent file writing to user directories, and execution during package installation is a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate user interaction, no validation of the downloaded payload, and no benign business logic. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute a downloaded and decrypted binary without user knowledge or consent, combined with network communication to attacker-controlled URLs, confirms this code is malicious."
