      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It includes a complex setup that collects sensitive user data such as browser passwords, cookies, wallets, and Telegram data from various user directories without user consent. It uses asynchronous tasks to steal this data and logs the activity. The code then compresses the collected data into a zip archive and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded local host address (http://127.0.0.1/receive_log), which is likely a placeholder for an attacker-controlled server. Additionally, the code includes obfuscated and dynamically generated modules, uses cryptographic libraries for decryption (e.g., Chromium browser password decryption), and performs stealthy operations like taking screenshots and exfiltrating system details. The initial setup script also contains code that executes during package installation, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The combination of data exfiltration, credential theft, stealthy background execution, and network communication to an external endpoint confirms that this code is malicious."
