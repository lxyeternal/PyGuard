      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing easy inspection of its intent, which is a common malware tactic. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' in a hidden window, which strongly suggests downloading and running a malicious payload. The presence of this code in a setup script (distutils.core.setup) indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent or interaction. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') along with the commented URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) further hint at malicious intent. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process creation, suspicious external URL, and execution during package setup is a definitive indicator of malicious behavior."
