      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install process to execute additional code during package installation. It checks for administrator privileges and attempts to elevate if not running as admin. Then, it silently downloads a file named 'image.png' from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://wpp-api-01hw.onrender.com/api/images/1140884481671188581/image.png) using the requests library with a custom header. The downloaded file is then read, base64-decoded, and executed immediately via exec(). This pattern of fetching remote code during installation, decoding it from base64, and executing it without any validation or user consent is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The code runs automatically on install, contacts an attacker-controlled server, writes files to the current directory without notification, and executes arbitrary code, all of which are strong indicators of malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the use of base64 decoding combined with exec on remote data is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."

It extracts a 'code' field from the JSON response and immediately executes it using exec(). This pattern of retrieving code from an untrusted remote source and executing it dynamically is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It enables remote code execution, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's system. There is no validation, sanitization, or user consent before execution, which is a critical security risk. The use of exec on remotely fetched code is a hallmark of malware, backdoors, or remote access trojans. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
