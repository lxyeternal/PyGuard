      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during package installation strongly indicate that the package is designed to run hidden malicious code on the victim's system during installation. The presence of network-related modules (requests) imported but not used in the visible code suggests the decrypted payload likely performs network communication or further malicious actions. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as code obfuscation, dynamic code execution during install, and potential remote code execution, all of which are typical in malware and supply chain attacks."
