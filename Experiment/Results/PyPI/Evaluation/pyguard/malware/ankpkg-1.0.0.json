      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command. During installation, it collects detailed environment and user information including hostname, fully qualified domain name, IP address, current working directory, and username. It then sends this sensitive information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (https://cas54n1gfihn6082nil0kz451ubndy6rt.dooracle.in) without any user consent or notification. This behavior is a classic example of automated data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The absence of legitimate business logic, user interaction, or transparency, combined with the collection and silent transmission of system and user identity data to an attacker-controlled server, strongly indicates malicious intent."
