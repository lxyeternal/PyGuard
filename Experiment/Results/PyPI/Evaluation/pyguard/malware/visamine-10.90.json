      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the 'Hidden' window style and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command, combined with silent execution without user interaction or notification, is a classic hallmark of malware attempting to execute hidden payloads or perform unauthorized actions. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the presence of this obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during installation strongly indicates malicious intent."
