      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the contents of /etc/passwd (which contains user account information), environment variables, host system details (via os.uname), current working directory, and user home directory path. It then serializes this data into JSON, encodes it with base64, and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious external URL ('https://pypi.org/reqs?d=') with a forged Host header ('psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net'). This behavior matches classic data exfiltration patterns seen in malware: silent collection of sensitive system and environment data without user consent, obfuscation of data via base64 encoding, and transmission to an external server under a misleading domain and header to evade detection. There is no legitimate user interaction, notification, or business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding before network transmission is a known obfuscation technique to evade detection. The reading of /etc/passwd and environment variables is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information stealing malware. The forged Host header suggests an attempt to disguise the true destination or evade network monitoring. Taken together, these factors strongly indicate malicious intent focused on covert data exfiltration."
