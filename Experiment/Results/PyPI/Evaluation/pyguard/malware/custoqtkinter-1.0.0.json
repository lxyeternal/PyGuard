      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec(). The decryption key and the encrypted payload are hardcoded and obfuscated using Fernet symmetric encryption. This decrypted code is executed immediately during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. Executing dynamically decrypted code at install time is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The package name 'custoqtkinter' and the obfuscated class name further suggest an attempt to evade detection. The use of exec() on decrypted data, combined with network-related imports and execution during installation, strongly indicates that the package is designed to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the victim's system. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious Python packages, including code obfuscation, execution of remote or hidden payloads during installation, and lack of legitimate user interaction."
