      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the embedded URL-like string in the comment and the obfuscated command. This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a background process without user interaction is a hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or payload delivery. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, enabling execution of malicious code during package installation. The presence of a suspicious package name ('selfsplitrandompyw') and author email further supports suspicion. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is overshadowed by the hidden PowerShell execution. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
