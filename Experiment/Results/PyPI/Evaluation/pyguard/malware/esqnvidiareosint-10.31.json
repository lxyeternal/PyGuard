      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (Base64 encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' in a hidden manner. The presence of a directory existence check ('tahg') before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The package metadata uses suspicious names and author information linked to 'EsqueleSquad', which is known for malicious activity. The combination of obfuscation (Base64 encoding), hidden execution, and remote code execution during package setup strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including stealth execution, obfuscated remote payload delivery, and execution during package installation."
