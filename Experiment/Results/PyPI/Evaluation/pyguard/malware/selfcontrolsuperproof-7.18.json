      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The command is triggered only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests stealth and evasion tactics. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during the setup process is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading and executing further payloads. Additionally, the package metadata and author information appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate software, further supporting the malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package installation, all of which are strongly associated with malware."
