      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'Windo​wsCache.exe' from that URL. This pattern of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and downloading/executing a remote payload is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for payload delivery, persistence, or remote code execution. Additionally, the package name 'tpcvgrandhacked' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' and the commented URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated remote payload during installation or execution, which is a critical risk and confirms malicious intent."
