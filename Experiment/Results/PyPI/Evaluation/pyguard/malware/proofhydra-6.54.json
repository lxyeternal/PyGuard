      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. This pattern of obfuscation (Base64 encoding) combined with hidden PowerShell execution is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for downloading or executing further malicious payloads or performing unauthorized system actions. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation without user consent or interaction. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands and no user notification or legitimate context confirms malicious intent."
