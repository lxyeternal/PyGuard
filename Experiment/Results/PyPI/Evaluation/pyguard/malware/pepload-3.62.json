      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, a typical stealth technique. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently during the setup phase (package installation) is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables stealthy execution of arbitrary code without user consent or interaction. This pattern is well-known in malware for persistence, payload delivery, or further exploitation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during installation is a hallmark of a supply chain attack or malicious package. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
