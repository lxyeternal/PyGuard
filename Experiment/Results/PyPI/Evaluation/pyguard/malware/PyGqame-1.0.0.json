      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a byte string and decrypted at runtime, then executed immediately without any user interaction or validation. This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated class names and encrypted payloads to hide the true intent, combined with execution during install time, strongly indicates malicious intent. The code also specifies 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup requirements, which are commonly used in malware for network communication and encryption. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code executes arbitrary code fetched from the encrypted payload, which could perform any harmful actions such as data exfiltration, persistence, or further payload downloads. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
