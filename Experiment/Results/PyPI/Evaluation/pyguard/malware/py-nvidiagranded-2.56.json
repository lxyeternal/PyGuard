      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the package name 'py-nvidiagranded' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and potentially typosquatted or attacker-controlled. The code attempts to create a directory named 'tahg' if it does not exist, which may be used for staging malicious files. The use of try/except blocks suppresses errors, which is common in malware to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy subprocess spawning, and suspicious package metadata strongly indicates malicious intent."
