      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or staging technique. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide the window further indicates stealthy execution. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name 'libpullproofencode' with an author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' and a comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip', which is not a known legitimate source. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious behavior consistent with malware that executes obfuscated PowerShell commands silently during package setup or installation, likely for payload delivery, persistence, or further exploitation."
