      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands, and it runs silently without user interaction or notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this hidden PowerShell process, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated execution or detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with encoded commands strongly indicate malicious intent. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover or delivery mechanism. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup is a strong indicator of malicious behavior."
