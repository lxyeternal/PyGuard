      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed during the package installation process (in the InstallCommand.run method). This payload performs several suspicious and malicious actions: it retrieves the current user's login name and constructs paths to the Windows Startup folder, then writes a PowerShell script to that folder. The PowerShell script is created as a hidden shell object and executed with obfuscated base64-encoded commands, which is a known technique for stealthy code execution and persistence. Additionally, the script writes a batch file that downloads and executes a remote executable from a suspicious URL (hosted on discordapp.com attachments), which is a clear indicator of remote code execution and potential malware delivery. The entire sequence is triggered automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), environment variable access to sensitive directories (APPDATA, Startup), spawning hidden PowerShell processes, and downloading/executing remote payloads collectively confirm that this code is malicious."
