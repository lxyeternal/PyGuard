      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The presence of a suspicious comment with a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raises suspicion. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is executed before it, during import or setup invocation. This pattern of executing obfuscated PowerShell commands in a hidden window during package setup is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior."
