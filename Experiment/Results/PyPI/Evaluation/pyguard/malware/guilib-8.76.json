      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for payload delivery, persistence, or further exploitation. The base64-encoded command is not decoded or inspected in the code, but the pattern of launching a hidden PowerShell with encoded commands is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, this execution occurs at import time or setup time without user interaction or consent, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious packages. The rest of the code is a standard-looking setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious behavior within a seemingly benign package installation script. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy execution of hidden payloads during package installation."
