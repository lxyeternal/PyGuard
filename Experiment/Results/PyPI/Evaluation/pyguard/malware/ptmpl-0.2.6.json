      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is a Python setup script using setuptools to configure package installation. It defines a custom install command class GruppeInstall that overrides the run() method. Inside run(), it imports the requests module and makes a single HTTP GET request to https://ipinfo.io/json, printing the JSON response. This is a benign operation typically used to retrieve public IP and geolocation information, likely for logging or informational purposes during installation. The code contains commented-out lines that hint at possible decryption and execution of encrypted code, but these lines are inactive and do not execute. The setup() call uses standard setuptools parameters, with no evidence of downloading or executing external code, no obfuscation, no base64 decoding or exec/eval calls, no file writing or deletion, no subprocess or shell command execution, and no data exfiltration. The network request is to a well-known public API and is read-only. There is no user data collection or transmission to suspicious endpoints. The code does not perform any suspicious environment variable access or file system manipulation. Overall, the code matches typical benign setup script behavior with a harmless network call for informational purposes. Therefore, it does not contain malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a shell script from a hardcoded, non-standard, suspicious URL (https://fhost.devxops.eu.org/devops/cicd/scripts/dh-storage-v1.1.sh) directly into the user's home directory without any user interaction or consent. It then makes the script executable and runs it with specific arguments. Additionally, it runs shell commands to update the package list and install 'tmux' without user confirmation. This pattern of downloading and executing remote code during a post-installation step, especially from an untrusted external source, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The absence of any validation, integrity checks, or user notification, combined with the execution of arbitrary shell code, aligns with known supply chain attack techniques and remote code execution malware patterns. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads scripts from a hardcoded external URL and executes them directly via subprocess.run without any validation or user consent. The scripts are fetched dynamically from a remote server and then executed as shell commands, with the 'sys' script run with elevated privileges (sudo). This pattern of downloading and executing arbitrary code from an untrusted remote source is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables remote code execution, potential privilege escalation, and arbitrary command execution on the host system. There is no integrity check, no user interaction or notification, and no sandboxing, which makes this code highly suspicious and potentially dangerous. Such behavior is commonly observed in malware that fetches and runs payloads from attacker-controlled servers."
