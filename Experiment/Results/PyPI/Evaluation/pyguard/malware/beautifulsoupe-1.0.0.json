      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, often used in supply chain attacks to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation. The package name 'BeautifulSoupe' is a likely typo-squatting attempt on the legitimate 'BeautifulSoup' package, which is a common tactic in malicious packages. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description and long description strings further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The use of 'exec' on decrypted data, combined with network-related imports (requests) and execution during installation, strongly suggests that the decrypted code likely performs unauthorized or harmful actions. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
