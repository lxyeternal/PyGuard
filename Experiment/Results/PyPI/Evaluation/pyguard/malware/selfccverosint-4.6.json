      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, a common stealth technique. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking a web request to a suspicious domain (noted in the comment as www.esquelesquad.rip) and executing a remote payload or performing system modifications. This behavior is typical of malware that uses obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide its intent and executes code silently without user consent or interaction. Additionally, the presence of this code in a setup script (distutils.core.setup) suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation. The combination of obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and suspicious domain reference confirms the code is malicious."
