      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Inside this method, it checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded string and decrypted at runtime, then executed immediately without any user interaction or validation. This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and execution during install time strongly indicates that the package is designed to run hidden malicious code on Windows systems when installed. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious payload execution context. The package name 'Sjimplejson' and the obfuscated description also suggest an attempt to disguise the package. Overall, this code exhibits critical risk indicators such as code obfuscation, dynamic code execution during installation, and use of encrypted payloads, all consistent with malicious intent."
