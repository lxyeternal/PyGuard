      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing and remote code execution malware. Key malicious characteristics include: 1) Execution of base64-decoded Python code written to a hidden temporary directory (__pycache__ in user's local temp folder) immediately after package installation commands ('install' or 'bdist'). 2) Automated installation of multiple dependencies (psutil, aiofiles, aiohttp, cryptography, aiosqlite, mss, pypiwin32) without user consent, likely to support malicious payload functionality. 3) The base64-decoded payload contains extensive code that collects sensitive user data such as browser cookies (via browser_cookie3), user login information, system environment details, and potentially passwords. 4) The payload performs stealthy file operations including copying, moving, and deleting files in user directories, including appdata, roaming, and startup folders, indicating persistence and data staging. 5) The code sends collected data via HTTP POST requests to suspicious, hardcoded external URLs (e.g., pythonanywhere.com domains, IP addresses like 185.121.81.66:1488), which is a classic data exfiltration technique. 6) The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flags and pythonw.exe to run the payload in hidden mode without user interaction. 7) The payload includes obfuscated and encoded strings, dynamic task creation, and asynchronous network communication, all hallmarks of evasive malware. 8) The code is triggered automatically during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector, without any user notification or legitimate business logic. 9) The presence of classes and functions named to suggest credential theft and environment reconnaissance (e.g., Config, Details, Exodus, Telegram, Chrome, WhatsApp) further confirms malicious intent. 10) The overall structure and behavior match known malware patterns including environment discovery, credential harvesting, data exfiltration, and stealthy execution. Based on these observations and the extensive knowledge base of malicious Python code patterns, this code is conclusively malicious."
