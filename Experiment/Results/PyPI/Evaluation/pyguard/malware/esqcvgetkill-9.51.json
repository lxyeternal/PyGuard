      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded), which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated detection. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) which is commonly abused for hosting malicious payloads. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a classic malware pattern to execute obfuscated commands without user visibility. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious code during package installation without user consent or interaction. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further aiding stealth. Overall, the combination of obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, suspicious external URL, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
