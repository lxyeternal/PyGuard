      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window hidden and uses obfuscation to conceal its actions. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process creation, and conditional execution without user consent or notification is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware that executes code during package installation."
