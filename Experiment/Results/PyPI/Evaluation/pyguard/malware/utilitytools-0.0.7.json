      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It abuses the setuptools installation hook (the AfterInstall class overriding the install command) to automatically execute code during package installation without user consent. Specifically, it downloads an executable file named 'pics.exe' from a suspicious, attacker-controlled GitHub URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe) and attempts to run it on the victim's machine. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery during package installation. The executable is downloaded silently without user interaction or notification, and executed immediately, which can lead to system compromise. The presence of network communication to an untrusted external source, file writing in the current directory, and execution of an arbitrary binary during install time are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the code imports subprocess but does not import it explicitly in the snippet, which would cause a runtime error, but this may be an oversight or incomplete snippet; the intent to run subprocess.Popen is clear. Overall, this code is designed to deliver and execute a potentially harmful payload during package installation, which is a high-risk malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded external URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe) and then runs it immediately without any user interaction, validation, or consent. This pattern of automatically fetching and executing a remote binary is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source. The use of subprocess.Popen to run the downloaded executable further confirms the intent to execute potentially harmful payloads. There is no indication of legitimate business logic, user notification, or security checks, which aligns with typical malware behavior such as payload delivery, remote code execution, or system compromise."
