      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests stealth and evasion. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads, often used in malware to avoid detection and execute arbitrary code silently. Additionally, the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The rest of the code is a typical setup script, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during the setup phase is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent or interaction. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup, all of which are strongly associated with malware."
