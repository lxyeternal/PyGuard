      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed during the setup script execution is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading and executing further payloads. The directory existence check for 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution. The use of a suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further supports suspicion. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially in the context of a Python package setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks."
