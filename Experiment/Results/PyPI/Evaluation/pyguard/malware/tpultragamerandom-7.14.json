      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This obfuscation technique (base64-encoded PowerShell command) is a well-known method to hide the true intent of the command and evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a stealth or persistence check. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to avoid user visibility. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands strongly indicate that the code is attempting to execute hidden, potentially harmful actions on the system without user consent. This behavior is typical of malware that executes payloads or downloads further malicious components during package installation or execution. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask the malicious payload execution during installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
