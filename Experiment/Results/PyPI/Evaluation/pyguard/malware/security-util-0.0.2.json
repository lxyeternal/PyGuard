      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command to execute code automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. It collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then encodes this data in base64 and sends it via an HTTPS GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (d4d.one). This behavior is a classic example of automated data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload, the silent network communication to an attacker-controlled server, and the execution of this code during install time without any legitimate purpose or user notification are strong indicators of malicious intent. Such patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are not typical of benign software, especially in setup scripts. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily collecting and exfiltrating system information."
