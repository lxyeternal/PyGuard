      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This obfuscation technique (base64-encoded PowerShell command) is a well-known method used by malware to execute arbitrary or harmful code stealthily. The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), which is typical for stealthy malware operations. The presence of this encoded PowerShell command execution during the setup process (package installation) strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup call, likely used as a cover or to blend in, but the subprocess call with the encoded PowerShell command is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
