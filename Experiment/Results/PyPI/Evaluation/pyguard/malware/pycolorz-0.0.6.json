      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior. It uses the setuptools setup function to define a package, but immediately after, it creates a temporary file containing Python code that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/39kv9/raw) without any user interaction or consent. This remote code is fetched via urllib.request and executed dynamically using exec, which is a strong indicator of remote code execution and a common malware technique. The temporary file is then executed using a system call that launches the Python interpreter in windowed mode to run the downloaded code. This pattern of downloading and executing arbitrary code during package installation or setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The absence of any validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic, combined with the direct execution of remote code, confirms the code is malicious."
