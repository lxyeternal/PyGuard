      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command, combined with silent execution in the background without user interaction or notification, is a classic hallmark of malware. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks or payload delivery during package installation, as it is embedded in a setup script. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution during installation is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
