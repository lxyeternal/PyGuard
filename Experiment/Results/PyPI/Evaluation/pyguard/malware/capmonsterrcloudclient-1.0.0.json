      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary decrypted code during package installation on Windows systems. Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload and immediately executes it with exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated encrypted data combined with dynamic code execution in the installation hook strongly indicates that the package is designed to run hidden malicious payloads on the victim's machine during installation. The package name and metadata appear random and suspicious, further supporting the malicious intent."
