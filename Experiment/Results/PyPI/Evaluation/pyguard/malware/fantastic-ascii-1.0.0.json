      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'new_install' that registers a function '_post_install' to be executed automatically at the end of the installation process. The '_post_install' function performs several suspicious actions without user consent or notification: it creates/appends a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with a specific string, collects the public IP address of the host via an external API (https://api.ipify.org), retrieves the hostname of the machine, and obtains the absolute path of the current script's directory. It then encodes this collected information (IP, hostname, path) into a base64 string and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'https://kotko.org' with a query parameter constructed from the package name and company string concatenated with the encoded data. This behavior constitutes automated environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The code executes this data collection and exfiltration silently during installation without any user interaction or legitimate business logic, indicating malicious intent. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the transmitted data and the hardcoded external URL further support this conclusion."
