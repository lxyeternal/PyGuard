      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed during the setup script execution is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The directory existence check for 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup call, likely used as a cover or to disguise the malicious payload. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and malicious package installation scripts, making the code malicious."
