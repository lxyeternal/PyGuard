      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a typical stealth behavior. The presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the package name 'esqmaskcpuhacked' further suggest malicious intent. The setup call appears to be a decoy or a cover to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. Overall, the code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and suspicious naming, consistent with malware patterns such as remote code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise."
