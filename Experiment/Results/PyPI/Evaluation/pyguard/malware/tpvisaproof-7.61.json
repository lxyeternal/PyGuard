      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the embedded URL-like string in the comment and the obfuscated command. This execution happens automatically during the import or setup phase without user interaction or consent. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution suggests evasion or persistence behavior. Additionally, the package metadata uses a suspicious author name and email, and the package name 'tpvisaproof' with a package 'modlib' is unusual and may be a typosquat or disguise. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and lack of legitimate context strongly indicates malicious intent."
