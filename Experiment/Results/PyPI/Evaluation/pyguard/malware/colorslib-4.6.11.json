      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a subprocess command during the package setup phase that uses PowerShell to download an executable file from a hardcoded external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mkd3enun97s8zag/Oxzy.exe?dl=0) and saves it as '~/WindowsCache.exe'. Immediately after downloading, it executes this file via Invoke-Expression. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malicious activity: automatic download and execution of a potentially untrusted binary without user consent or notification. The code attempts to suppress the console window by using subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, indicating stealth intent. The execution occurs during the installation/setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The package metadata (name 'colorslib', author 'Lolip0p') and the use of a Dropbox URL for the executable further suggest suspicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a package setup script to download and run an external executable silently. Therefore, this code contains clear malicious behavior."
