      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as indicated by the suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip). This pattern of obfuscated command execution during package setup or installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script for a Python package, which is a common technique to hide malicious payloads in seemingly benign packages. Therefore, this code is malicious."
