      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, indicating stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware technique. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the command, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This behavior is typical of malware that executes hidden payloads or performs unauthorized actions during package installation or execution. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask errors and avoid detection. Overall, the presence of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered automatically without user interaction or consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
