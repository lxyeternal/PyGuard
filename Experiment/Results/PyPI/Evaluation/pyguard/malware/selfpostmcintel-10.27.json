      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated in base64 UTF-16LE format, which is a common method to hide malicious intent. The command references a suspicious GitHub URL (https://github.com/T4Hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and executes a file named Stage1.exe from that remote location, indicating a likely download and execution of a malicious payload. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. This behavior is triggered automatically during the import or setup phase without any user interaction or consent, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malware embedded in Python packages. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution, remote payload download, hidden process creation, and lack of legitimate business logic strongly indicate malicious intent."
