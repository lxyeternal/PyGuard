      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class (CustomInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it executes a shell command that downloads and executes a remote shell script from 'https://down.threatest.com/uploads/install.sh' using wget piped directly to bash. This is done by encoding the command in base64 and then decoding and executing it immediately via os.system. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the user's system during package installation without user consent or interaction. The remote script could perform any number of harmful actions, including downloading malware, exfiltrating data, or compromising the system. Such behavior is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and is not justified in legitimate setup scripts. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
