      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and attempts to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' silently. This behavior is consistent with downloading and executing a malicious payload from a remote server without user consent or notification. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious author information ('EsqueleSquad') and an unusual package name ('tppiphttpstring'), which may be typosquatting or misleading. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further suggests an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, remote payload download and execution, stealth execution (hidden window), and suspicious package metadata, consistent with a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism."
