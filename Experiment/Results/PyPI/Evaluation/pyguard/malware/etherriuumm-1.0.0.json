      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Within this method, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded Fernet key. Executing decrypted code at install time without user interaction or consent is a classic supply chain attack technique. This allows arbitrary code execution during package installation, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The package name 'etherriuumm' is suspicious and likely a typosquat. The obfuscated class name and the use of encrypted payload executed via exec() further confirm malicious behavior. There is no legitimate reason for decrypting and executing code during installation, especially without user notification. This pattern is a hallmark of malware that delivers and executes hidden payloads during package installation, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise."
