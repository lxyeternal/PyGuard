      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known method for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads, often used in malware for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further malicious payloads. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. The subprocess call is wrapped in a try/except block with a pass, which suppresses errors and avoids detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and potential supply chain attack vector during package installation."
