      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It hijacks the setuptools installation process by subclassing the install command to run unauthorized code during package installation. It collects sensitive system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username without user consent. It attempts to create a suspicious file in the root directory (/root/j0j0.poc), which is unusual and potentially harmful. The code enumerates directories on the system (/run/, /etc/, /home/, /mnt/, /rasp/) and sends their listings via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (https://j0j0.xyz), indicating data exfiltration. Furthermore, it reads sensitive files such as '/.dockerenv', '/root/.wget-hsts', and '/run/docker.sock'—which may contain environment or credential information—and uploads their raw contents to the same external server. This behavior is consistent with reconnaissance and data theft malware. The absence of any user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic, combined with the use of hardcoded attacker-controlled URLs and the execution of this code automatically during package installation, confirms that this is a supply chain attack vector designed for stealthy data exfiltration and system information gathering. Therefore, the code is malicious."
