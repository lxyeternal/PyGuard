      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (\"https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0\") which appears to be a remote executable download and execution attempt. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to download and execute a payload silently on the victim's machine. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The presence of this code inside a setup script (distutils.core.setup) further suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation without user consent. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad', 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and the commented URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) also hint at a malicious or suspicious origin. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell command execution, hidden process spawning, remote payload download, and execution during package setup is a definitive indicator of malicious intent."
