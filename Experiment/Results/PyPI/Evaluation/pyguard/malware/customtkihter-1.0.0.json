      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command class that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during installation strongly indicate a supply chain attack vector. The package name and metadata are nonsensical and likely designed to evade detection. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks but instead runs hidden code on the user's system during installation, which is a critical risk indicator of malware."
