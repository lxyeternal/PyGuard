      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, during installation, downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1061889522541011006/1089965304202928128/ratfinal.py) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this script to the local directory and immediately executes it using subprocess with the current Python interpreter. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector enabling remote code execution during package installation. The downloaded script is fetched from an untrusted, attacker-controlled source and executed without validation or sandboxing, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or integrity checks, combined with the direct download and execution of remote code during install, is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
