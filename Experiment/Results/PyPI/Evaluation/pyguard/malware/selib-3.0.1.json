      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded string that is decoded and immediately executed using exec and compile during the setup process. This decoded payload imports modules and executes a network request to a suspicious external URL ('https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/hzzzp/raw'), fetching and executing remote code without user consent or interaction. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malicious activity, specifically a supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code execution occurs during package installation. The obfuscation via base64 encoding, dynamic execution of remote code, and lack of any legitimate business logic or user notification strongly indicate malicious intent."
