      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script but includes this hidden malicious payload execution. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or malicious package installation behavior."
