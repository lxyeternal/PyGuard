      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known method for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' (a non-standard domain) further raise suspicion. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the hidden PowerShell execution during import or setup is a classic supply chain attack pattern. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package setup, all strongly associated with malware."
