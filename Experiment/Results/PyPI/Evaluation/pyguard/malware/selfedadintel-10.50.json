      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a directory existence check ('tahg') before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as indicated by the suspicious URL comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated command. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or payload delivery. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script but contains no benign logic to justify this hidden execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
