      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware and information exfiltration tools. It performs extensive environment reconnaissance by collecting system information such as username, computer name, hardware IDs, IP address, and geolocation. It stealthily extracts sensitive data including browser cookies, saved passwords, credit card information, Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Minecraft files, and browsing history from various browsers and applications. The code uses Windows APIs to decrypt encrypted credentials and cookies. It also monitors and manipulates the clipboard to replace cryptocurrency wallet addresses with attacker-controlled addresses, a known clipboard hijacking technique to steal cryptocurrency. The malware attempts to evade detection by checking for virtual machine environments, blacklisted usernames, IPs, and processes, and can kill Discord-related processes to avoid interference. It automatically copies itself to the Windows startup folder for persistence. The stolen data and system information are compressed into archives and exfiltrated to attacker-controlled Discord webhooks and other remote endpoints (e.g., https://kekwltd.ru/relay). The code uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding, random file names, and multiple layers of threading to evade analysis and detection. It installs numerous Python packages silently and runs without user interaction or consent. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled URLs, webhook endpoints, and cryptographic keys further confirms malicious intent. Overall, this code is a sophisticated, multi-stage information stealer designed to harvest credentials, tokens, and sensitive user data from Windows systems and exfiltrate it to remote servers controlled by attackers."
