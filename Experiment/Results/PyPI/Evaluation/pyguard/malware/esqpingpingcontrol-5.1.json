      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string passed via the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell code, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated detection or to stage payloads. The PowerShell command runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), suppressing any user-visible output, which is typical for stealthy malware. Additionally, the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the package metadata author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email address 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The use of subprocess to execute obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup or import is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution without user consent. No legitimate user interaction or notification is present before this background activity begins. Therefore, this code is malicious."
