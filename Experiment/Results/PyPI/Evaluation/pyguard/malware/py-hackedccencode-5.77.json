      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The PowerShell command is run with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded command likely contains obfuscated instructions to download, execute, or perform other unauthorized actions. Additionally, the package name 'py-hackedccencode' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest suspicious intent. The code runs this payload automatically during the setup process without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack pattern. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is malicious."
