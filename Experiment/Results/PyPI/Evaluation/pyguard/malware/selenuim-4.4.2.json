      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It hooks into the setuptools installation process to execute code automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. It collects the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' (host identifier) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', which is a classic data exfiltration technique. Furthermore, if the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable file from another suspicious URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', saves it locally as 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe', and immediately executes it using 'os.system'. This sequence of downloading and running an untrusted executable during installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The package name 'selenuim' is a likely typo-squatting attempt to mimic the legitimate 'selenium' package, which is a common tactic in malicious PyPI packages. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware trying to evade detection. Overall, the combination of environment data exfiltration, downloading and executing remote binaries, automatic execution during install, and suspicious domain usage confirms this code is malicious."
