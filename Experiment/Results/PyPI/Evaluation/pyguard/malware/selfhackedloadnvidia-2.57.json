      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the use of a non-standard package name ('selfhackedloadnvidia' by 'EsqueleSquad') further indicate malicious intent. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and attempts to invoke a web request to a Dropbox domain, which is a typical pattern for downloading or executing additional payloads or exfiltrating data. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag suppresses any visible window, which is a stealth technique. The overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated code execution, stealthy background process spawning, and potential remote code execution or data exfiltration. The setup() call appears benign but is likely a cover or part of a supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during package installation."
