      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string using subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated in base64 UTF-16LE format, which is commonly used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The command references a suspicious GitHub URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and attempts to invoke a web request with a user-agent string, indicating it is likely downloading and executing a payload from a remote source without user consent or notification. The presence of this behavior inside a try-except block suppresses errors and hides the activity. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious author and email information ('EsqueleSquad', 'tahgoficial@proton.me'), which aligns with the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip', a known malicious group or campaign. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery during installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
