      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known method for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. Additionally, the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled identity. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during the setup phase is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent or interaction. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation, all of which are strongly associated with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
