      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This technique is a well-known method for stealthy execution of potentially harmful or unauthorized commands without user interaction or notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands strongly suggest that the code is designed to execute hidden payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the system. Additionally, this execution occurs during the setup process of a Python package, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
