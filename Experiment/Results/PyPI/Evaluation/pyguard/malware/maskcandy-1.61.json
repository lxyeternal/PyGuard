      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (Base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden, which is a common stealth technique used by malware to avoid user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing easy analysis and is a hallmark of malware attempting to hide its true intent. This execution happens automatically during the setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code runs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly normal package installation script. Given these factors and the known risk indicators (hidden PowerShell execution, base64 obfuscation, execution during install, lack of user interaction), this code is malicious."
