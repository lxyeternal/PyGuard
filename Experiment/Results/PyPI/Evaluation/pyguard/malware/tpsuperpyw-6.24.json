      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (# www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated command string. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic hallmark of malware, often used in supply chain attacks to execute malicious code during installation without user consent or awareness. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered automatically on import or installation is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
