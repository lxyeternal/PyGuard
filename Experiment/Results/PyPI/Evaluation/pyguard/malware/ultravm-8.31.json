      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a known stealth technique. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell command execution during the setup phase (package installation) is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as legitimate packages rarely execute hidden shell commands with encoded payloads on install. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the hidden PowerShell execution is unrelated to normal package setup and is likely intended for malicious purposes such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
