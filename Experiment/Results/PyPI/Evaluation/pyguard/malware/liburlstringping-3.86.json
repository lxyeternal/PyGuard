      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only if it does not exist, it executes the PowerShell command. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to a suspicious URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/107974949475150594048/Esquele.exe) and outputs it to a file named 'x/WindowsCache.exe', then invokes execution of that file. This behavior is a classic pattern of downloading and executing a remote payload stealthily during package setup/install, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and remote code download and execution without user consent or validation confirms the malicious intent."
