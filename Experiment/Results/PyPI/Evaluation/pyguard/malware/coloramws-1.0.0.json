      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that overrides the standard install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code via exec(). The encrypted payload is decrypted using a hardcoded Fernet key and ciphertext, which is a strong indicator of obfuscated and hidden code execution. Executing decrypted code during package installation without user interaction or consent is a classic supply chain attack technique. The use of exec on decrypted data, combined with obfuscation and execution triggered automatically during installation, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and abuse of Python packaging hooks for remote code execution and payload delivery."
