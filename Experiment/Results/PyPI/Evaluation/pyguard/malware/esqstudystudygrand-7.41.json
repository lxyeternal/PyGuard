      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the use of a non-standard package name ('esqstudystudygrand') with an author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raise suspicion. The encoded PowerShell command references a URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) which appears to be a remote payload download or execution source, indicating potential remote code execution or payload delivery. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or malware installation vector. Therefore, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior."
