      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command appears to invoke a web request to a suspicious URL (\"https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0\") and outputs it to a file named \"~\\/WindowsCache.exe\" followed by execution of that file. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote executable in a hidden manner is a classic malware behavior, often used for payload delivery, persistence, or further compromise. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which may be an evasion or staging technique. The presence of this code inside a setup script further suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The author and email fields referencing 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me' along with the suspicious URL and obfuscated command reinforce the malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
