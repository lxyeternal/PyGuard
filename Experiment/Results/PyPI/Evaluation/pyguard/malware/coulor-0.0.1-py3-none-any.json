      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a temporary Python script file containing code that fetches and executes remote code from a suspicious, hardcoded URL ('https://discock.netlify.app/discock/nigger') without any user interaction or consent. It then attempts to execute this script using a modified Python executable name (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe') via a shell command. This pattern of dynamically downloading and executing code from an untrusted external source is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, enabling remote code execution and potential payload delivery. The use of a temporary file to stage the payload, the obfuscated import aliases, the lack of error handling or user notification, and the execution of arbitrary remote code all strongly indicate malicious intent."
