      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a well-known obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' also raise suspicion. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is executed before it, during import or setup. This pattern of executing obfuscated PowerShell commands in hidden mode during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
