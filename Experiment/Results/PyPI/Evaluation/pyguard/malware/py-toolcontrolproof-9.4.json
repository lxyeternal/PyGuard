      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) which is likely a payload download or execution attempt. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell commands executed silently during package setup or import is a hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy payload delivery, persistence, or remote code execution. Additionally, the package metadata references 'EsqueleSquad' and an email address that may be attacker-controlled, further suggesting malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup call but is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, which is also suspicious. Overall, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
