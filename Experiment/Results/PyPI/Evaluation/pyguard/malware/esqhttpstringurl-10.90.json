      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' in a hidden manner. The presence of a directory existence check ('tahg') before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. This pattern of obfuscated command execution via PowerShell, hidden process spawning, and use of suspicious external URLs is a hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy payload delivery, persistence, or remote code execution. The rest of the code (setup call) appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except that suppresses errors, which is common in malicious setup scripts to avoid detection. Overall, this code is malicious and likely part of a supply chain attack or malware installer."
