      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for evasion and to execute arbitrary code without user awareness. The base64-encoded command likely contains a PowerShell script that performs unauthorized or harmful actions, although the exact decoded content is not shown here. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. These factors combined—obfuscated command execution, stealthy hidden process spawning, conditional execution based on file system state, and execution during package installation—are strong indicators of malicious behavior."
