      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing and supply chain attack malware. It uses base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and written to files in a hidden temporary directory, then executed via subprocesses with hidden windows, evading user detection. The code collects sensitive user environment information such as USERPROFILE, APPDATA, and browser data directories, and extracts browser cookies using browser_cookie3, a known technique for stealing authentication tokens. It performs automated HTTP POST requests to suspicious external endpoints, including hardcoded IP addresses and webhook URLs, to exfiltrate stolen data. The code dynamically downloads and executes additional payloads from remote URLs without user consent, including scripts named 'bypass.py' and 'updater.git', indicating multi-stage infection. It uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding, zlib decompression, and dynamic code execution (exec, eval) to hide its true intent. The malicious payload is triggered automatically during package installation (setup.py), a classic supply chain attack vector. It also attempts to create and delete files in system and user directories, including startup folders, to maintain persistence. The presence of subprocess.Popen calls with encoded PowerShell commands and hidden creation flags further confirms stealthy execution. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily collect, exfiltrate sensitive user data, execute arbitrary code, and maintain persistence, all without user interaction or consent, which are hallmark behaviors of malware."
