      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the use of a hidden PowerShell window strongly indicate stealthy, potentially malicious behavior. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name ('py-osintgrandpush') that does not correspond to any known legitimate library, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth execution flags, and suspicious package setup strongly indicates that this code is designed to execute malicious payloads during package installation or execution."
