      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The PowerShell command runs in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden) and uses obfuscated parameters, which strongly suggests stealthy execution of potentially harmful or unauthorized actions. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) and a suspicious package name ('selfgrandminepep') authored by 'EsqueleSquad' further supports the suspicion. The code is executed during the setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation without user consent or interaction. These factors combined align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated code execution, stealth process spawning, and potential for further payload delivery or system compromise."
