      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including base64, zlib decompression, and character code transformations, followed by dynamic execution via eval and exec. The code constructs and executes code dynamically from obfuscated data, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of eval on decoded and decompressed data without any validation or user interaction is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious payloads. Additionally, the code imports modules commonly used in obfuscation and malware (random, base64, codecs, zlib) and contains a large obfuscated string that is decoded and executed at runtime. This pattern matches known malware behaviors such as code obfuscation, dynamic payload execution, and evasion of static analysis. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
