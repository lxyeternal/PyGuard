      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed immediately upon import, combined with the check for a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution), is a classic stealth technique used by malware. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggest suspicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup call for a package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. This pattern—obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup or import—is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
