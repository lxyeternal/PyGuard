      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (\"https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm...\"), which is likely used to download or execute further payloads. The presence of this obfuscated, encoded PowerShell command executed silently during the setup process (package installation) is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The package metadata also contains suspicious author information and a suspicious package name, which may be typosquatting or otherwise deceptive. The try/except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands that likely download and run malicious payloads without user consent or interaction."
