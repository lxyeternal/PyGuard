      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The encoded command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip and the encoded command hint at remote code execution). This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a setup script is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware that execute code during package installation. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, remote URL references, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
