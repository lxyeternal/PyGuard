      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Within this method, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package setup scripts. The package name 'Matplottib' is a typo-squatted variant of the legitimate 'matplotlib' package, which is a common tactic used to trick users into installing malicious packages. The use of obfuscated, encrypted code executed during installation without user interaction or consent, combined with network-related imports (requests) and execution of decrypted code, strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector designed to execute arbitrary malicious code on the victim's system during package installation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
