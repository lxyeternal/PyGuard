      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It performs conditional checks on sys.argv and sys.platform with obfuscated string construction, indicating environment awareness and targeted execution. The code imports modules like pip and win32com, attempts to create and write files in user directories (e.g., using environment variables like APPDATA), and uses Windows COM interfaces to create and save shortcuts. It also performs directory walking and file operations with suspicious file extensions, likely to propagate or persist. The obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns, combined with writing files to system/user directories, creating shortcuts, and checking for admin privileges, are classic hallmarks of malware, especially supply chain or installer-based attacks. The code runs during setup (package installation), which is a known vector for malicious code execution. There is no legitimate user interaction or benign business logic, and the complexity and obfuscation strongly indicate malicious intent such as persistence, payload deployment, or system compromise."
