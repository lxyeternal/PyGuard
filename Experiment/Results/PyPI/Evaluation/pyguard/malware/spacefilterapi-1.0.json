      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive user data. It collects environment information such as IP address and username, decrypts stored browser data using Windows APIs, and extracts Discord tokens and user information. The code then exfiltrates this stolen data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without user consent. It also searches user directories for files containing keywords related to accounts, passwords, and secrets, uploads these files to anonymous file hosting services, and sends links to the attacker. The code uses threading to perform these actions stealthily and kills processes to access locked files. It installs required dependencies silently if missing. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URLs, use of Windows cryptographic APIs to decrypt browser data, extraction of Discord tokens, and automated exfiltration of sensitive data to external servers are definitive indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
