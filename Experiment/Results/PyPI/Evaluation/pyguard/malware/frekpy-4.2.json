      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mkd3enun97s8zag/Oxzy.exe?dl=0) and writes it to the TEMP directory as 'Python-3.9.exe'. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using os.system without any user interaction, validation, or consent. This pattern of fetching a binary from an untrusted remote source and executing it directly is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling arbitrary code execution and potential system compromise. The repeated calls to the script() function inside seemingly benign static methods serve as a stealthy trigger to run the malicious payload in various contexts, increasing the chance of execution. The use of try/except blocks suppresses errors and avoids detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the behavior aligns with known malicious patterns such as remote payload delivery, execution of untrusted code, and evasion techniques. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
