      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'new_install' that registers a function '_post_install' to be executed at exit during the package installation process. The '_post_install' function performs several suspicious actions without user consent or notification: it creates/appends a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with a specific string, collects the public IP address of the host via an external API (https://api.ipify.org), retrieves the hostname of the machine, and obtains the absolute path of the current script directory. It then encodes this collected information (IP, hostname, path) into a base64 string and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL constructed as 'https://kotko.org?google-research/languagepredpatt=<base64_encoded_data>'. This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and environment information during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious code. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the transmitted data, the lack of any legitimate user interaction or business logic, and the execution of this code during the install phase (via setuptools install hook) strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no benign justification for silently sending host IP and hostname information to an external, non-standard domain during package installation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
