      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads, often used in malware to avoid detection and execute arbitrary code without user consent or notification. This behavior occurs during the import or setup phase, which can be triggered during package installation, indicating a supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscated commands is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
