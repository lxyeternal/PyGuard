      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports 'pytransform' and calls 'pyarmor_runtime()', then invokes '__pyarmor__' with a large obfuscated byte string. This pattern is characteristic of PyArmor-protected Python scripts, which are typically used to obfuscate and protect code. The presence of such heavy obfuscation and runtime decryption is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially since the code does not contain any readable logic and instead relies on executing hidden payloads. Given the extensive obfuscation and the use of PyArmor runtime, it is highly likely that the code contains hidden malicious behavior, such as executing unauthorized or harmful operations, data exfiltration, or payload delivery. This matches multiple critical risk indicators including code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and lack of transparency, all of which are hallmarks of malware."
