      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window hidden and uses obfuscation to evade detection. This behavior is strongly indicative of malicious intent, as it involves stealthy execution of obfuscated code without user interaction or notification, a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of subprocess to execute PowerShell commands in hidden mode further support the conclusion that this code is malicious. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is triggered during import or execution of this script, which is a known supply chain attack vector."
