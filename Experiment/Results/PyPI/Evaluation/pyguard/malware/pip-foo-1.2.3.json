      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'new_install' that registers a function '_post_install' to be executed at exit during the package installation process. The '_post_install' function performs several suspicious actions without user consent or notification: it writes a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with a specific string, collects the public IP address of the host via an external API (https://api.ipify.org), retrieves the hostname of the machine, and obtains the absolute path of the current script directory. It then encodes this collected information (IP, hostname, and path) into a base64 string and sends it as a GET request parameter to a suspicious external URL 'https://kotko.org' with a query parameter constructed from the package's company and name variables. This behavior constitutes automated environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages. The code executes this data collection and exfiltration silently during installation without any user interaction or legitimate purpose, indicating malicious intent."
