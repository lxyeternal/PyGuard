      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' in a hidden manner. The presence of a directory existence check ('tahg') before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command, combined with spawning a hidden process, is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution, persistence, or payload delivery. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious author and email information ('EsqueleSquad', 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and a suspicious package name ('selfultraintelvisa'), which may be typosquatted or malicious. Overall, this code is highly likely to be malicious, as it executes obfuscated remote code in a stealthy manner during package setup or import."
