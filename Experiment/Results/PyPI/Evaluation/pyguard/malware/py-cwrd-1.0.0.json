      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class GruppeInstall that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code via exec(). The decryption uses a hardcoded Fernet key and an encrypted payload, which is not visible in plaintext. Executing decrypted code during package installation without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. This pattern is strongly associated with malware because it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further payload delivery. The obfuscation via Fernet encryption and immediate execution of the decrypted payload, combined with the execution triggered automatically on install, confirms the code is malicious."
