      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'GruppeInstall' that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it silently installs the 'fernet' package, then decrypts a large base64-encoded payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. This decrypted payload is Python code that is written to a file named 'gruppe.py' in the user's APPDATA directory. Immediately after writing, the code launches this script in a hidden, detached process without user interaction or notification. This behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks and malware that execute arbitrary, obfuscated code during package installation. The use of encrypted payloads, writing to system/user directories, silent subprocess execution with no output, and execution of decrypted code at install time are strong indicators of malicious intent. The package metadata and keywords (e.g., 'ratting') further suggest malicious purpose. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with malware that deploys and executes hidden payloads during installation."
