      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest command to download and run an executable named 'WindowsCache.exe' from that URL. This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution to download and run a remote payload is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, and potential system compromise. Additionally, the package name 'py-nvidiapepnvidia' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and unrelated to the described functionality, which further supports the malicious intent. The use of try/except to silently suppress errors also indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is executing a hidden, obfuscated remote payload download and execution during package setup, which is a high-risk supply chain attack vector."
