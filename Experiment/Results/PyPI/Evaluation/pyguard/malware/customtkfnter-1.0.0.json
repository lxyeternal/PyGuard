      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Inside this method, it checks if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded byte string and decrypted at runtime, then executed immediately with exec(). This pattern of embedding encrypted code and executing it during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The package name and metadata are obfuscated and suspicious. The code executes arbitrary code during installation without user consent or interaction, which can lead to remote code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution in a setup install hook strongly indicates malicious intent."
