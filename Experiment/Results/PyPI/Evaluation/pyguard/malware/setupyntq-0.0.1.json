      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is highly obfuscated and uses base64 decoding to dynamically execute Python code. The decoded payload imports modules such as tempfile, sys, os, and urllib.request, then creates a temporary file and writes to it a Python script that performs HTTP requests to suspicious hardcoded IP addresses (e.g., 'http://20.226.18.203:1337/grab/ry2L1CIVRSFa59vT' and 'http://20.226.18.203:1337/clip'). It reads data from these URLs and executes it immediately. The code also attempts to replace '.exe' with 'w.exe' in the executable path and runs the temporary file's content. This pattern of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network communication to attacker-controlled IPs, and execution of downloaded code is a classic hallmark of malware, specifically remote code execution and data exfiltration. The absence of any user interaction, the use of temporary files for payload staging, and the direct execution of remote code without validation confirm malicious intent."
