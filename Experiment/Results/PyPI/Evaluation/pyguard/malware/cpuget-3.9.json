      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally (only if the 'tahg' directory does not exist) suggests stealth and evasion. This pattern of executing obfuscated PowerShell commands in hidden mode is a well-known technique used by malware for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, enabling code execution during package installation. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during installation strongly indicates malicious intent."
