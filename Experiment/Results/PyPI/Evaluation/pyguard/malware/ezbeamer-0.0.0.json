      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding, string escaping, and dynamic evaluation (eval). It imports modules dynamically and decodes large base64-encoded payloads which are then decompressed and executed at runtime. The code uses eval on decoded and decompressed data, a classic hallmark of malicious behavior to hide payloads and evade static analysis. The obfuscation includes multiple layers of decoding and decompressing, followed by execution, which is typical for malware to conceal its true intent. The code also appears to perform environment discovery and likely exfiltrates or executes unauthorized code without user consent. The use of eval on dynamically decoded data, combined with obfuscation and lack of legitimate user interaction, strongly indicates malicious intent such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or payload delivery. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
