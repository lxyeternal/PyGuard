      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command. During installation, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com). This behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation to silently exfiltrate system information without user consent or notification. The use of a non-standard, attacker-controlled domain for data exfiltration, combined with automatic execution during install, strongly indicates malicious intent."
