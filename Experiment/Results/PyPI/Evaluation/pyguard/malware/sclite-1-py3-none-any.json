      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious token grabber targeting Discord and other applications. It collects sensitive user data including Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Chrome passwords, and cookies by accessing local application data directories and decrypting stored credentials using Windows APIs. It attempts to bypass Discord token protection and BetterDiscord modifications, kills Discord processes optionally, and can copy itself to startup for persistence. The code then packages the stolen data into a zip archive and exfiltrates it via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. It also downloads and injects malicious JavaScript code into Discord's application files from a remote GitHub URL. The code runs stealthily without user consent, hides itself, and uses threading and asynchronous calls to evade detection. These behaviors—credential theft, data exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints, process killing, persistence mechanisms, and remote code injection—are hallmark indicators of malware and confirm the code's malicious intent."
