      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or performing system compromise. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands in a setup script context, combined with the lack of legitimate user-facing functionality and the suspicious author email and comments, strongly indicates this is a supply chain attack or malware embedded in a Python package installation script."
