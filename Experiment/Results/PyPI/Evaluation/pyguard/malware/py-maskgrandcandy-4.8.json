      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The PowerShell command runs in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden) and uses the 'Invoke-WebRequest' cmdlet to download and execute a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com), which is a known file hosting service often abused by malware authors. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and executes a secondary payload without user consent or notification, running stealthily in the background. Additionally, the package metadata references 'EsqueleSquad' and an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which may be associated with malicious actors. The presence of this code in a setup script means the malicious payload executes automatically during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. All these factors combined confirm that the code is malicious."
