      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential-stealing malware targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive user data. It collects Discord tokens from various local storage paths of browsers and Discord clients, decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI, and exfiltrates this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code installs required dependencies silently, uses threading to perform concurrent data collection, and uploads stolen data including tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from user directories. It also attempts to gather detailed user information from Discord APIs using stolen tokens, including billing info, friends, badges, and server ownership. The code uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 decoding and AES decryption of stored credentials, and suppresses errors to evade detection. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data exfiltration, automated installation of dependencies, silent data collection from sensitive locations (browser and Discord storage), and uploading of stolen credentials and files without user consent are definitive indicators of malicious behavior. The code is executed automatically upon import and includes a setup() call, indicating it may be used as a malicious Python package or installer. All these factors confirm that this code is malicious and designed for credential theft and data exfiltration."
