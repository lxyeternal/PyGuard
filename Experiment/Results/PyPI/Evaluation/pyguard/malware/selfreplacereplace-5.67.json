      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it executes obfuscated PowerShell code silently without user interaction or notification. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and analysis. The script is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The presence of a suspicious comment with a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further suggests malicious origin. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process creation (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), and execution during package setup strongly indicates this code is malicious."
