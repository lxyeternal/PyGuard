      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of an obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell command executed silently is a classic hallmark of malware, often used to download, execute, or install further malicious payloads without user consent or knowledge. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the presence of this hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution during installation is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
