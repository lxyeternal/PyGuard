      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or performing system compromise. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip), which is uncommon for legitimate packages. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with hidden PowerShell execution is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or persistence. The try/except blocks suppress errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious intent, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and suspicious package metadata."
