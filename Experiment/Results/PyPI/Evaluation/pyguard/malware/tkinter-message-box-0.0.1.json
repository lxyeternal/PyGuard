      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive user data from the Telegram Desktop application's 'tdata' directory located in the APPDATA folder, which contains user session and authentication data. It archives this data into a zip file in memory and then exfiltrates it by sending an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Telegram Bot API endpoint, uploading the archive to a specific chat ID. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration without user consent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setuptools setup script, which can cause this malicious activity to execute during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of hardcoded bot tokens and chat IDs for data exfiltration, combined with accessing sensitive application data and sending it to an attacker-controlled endpoint, is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
