      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware and information exfiltration tools. It performs extensive environment reconnaissance by collecting system information such as username, computer name, hardware IDs, IP address, and geographic location. It stealthily extracts sensitive data including browser cookies, saved passwords, credit card information, Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Minecraft files, and browsing history from various browsers and applications. The code uses Windows API calls to decrypt encrypted credentials and cookies. It also monitors and manipulates the clipboard to replace cryptocurrency wallet addresses with attacker-controlled addresses, a known clipboard hijacking technique to steal cryptocurrency. The malware attempts to evade detection by checking for virtual machine environments, blacklisted process names, and suspicious usernames. It kills Discord-related processes to potentially prevent user notification or token invalidation. The stolen data is compressed into zip archives and exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URLs (e.g., https://kekwltd.ru/relay). The code installs multiple Python packages silently, uses threading for concurrent execution, and hides its activities by running in the background without user interaction or consent. It also attempts persistence by copying itself to the Windows startup folder. The presence of obfuscated variable and function names, base64 decoding of keys, and direct network communication to suspicious domains further confirm its malicious intent. Overall, this code is a sophisticated, multi-stage information stealer designed to harvest credentials, tokens, and sensitive user data and send it to an attacker-controlled server without user knowledge."
