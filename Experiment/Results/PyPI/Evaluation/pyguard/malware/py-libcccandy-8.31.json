      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest command to download and run an executable named 'WindowsCache.exe' from that URL. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and executes a payload without user consent or notification. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. The presence of a suspicious author email and package name further supports the malicious intent. The try/except blocks suppress errors, which is another evasion technique. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily download and execute a remote payload during installation, which is a hallmark of malicious activity."
