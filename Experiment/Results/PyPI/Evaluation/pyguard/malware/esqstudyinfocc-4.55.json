      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed in hidden mode is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or repeated execution. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command and the execution of this command during the setup process (package installation) strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector. The package metadata and author information appear suspicious and unrelated to any known legitimate package, further supporting malicious intent. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated code execution, stealthy process spawning, and execution during package installation."
