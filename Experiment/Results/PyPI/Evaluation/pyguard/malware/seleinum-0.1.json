      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It performs conditional checks on sys.platform and sys.argv to trigger different behaviors. The code imports modules like pip and win32com, attempts to create and write files in user directories (e.g., using environment variables like APPDATA), and uses Windows COM interfaces to create and save shortcuts. It also walks through directories, searches for files with specific extensions, and manipulates them. The obfuscation and dynamic construction of strings, combined with writing files to system/user directories, creating shortcuts, and potentially executing code during package setup, are strong indicators of malicious behavior. Such patterns are consistent with malware that attempts persistence, payload deployment, or system compromise during package installation. The code does not show any legitimate user interaction or benign purpose and matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious Python code, including obfuscated code execution, environment discovery, file system manipulation, and use of Windows-specific APIs for stealthy operations."
