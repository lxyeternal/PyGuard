      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution to avoid user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the obfuscated Base64 string and the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip). Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute automatically during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these factors combined—obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, execution during package installation, and references to suspicious domains—confirm that this code is malicious."
