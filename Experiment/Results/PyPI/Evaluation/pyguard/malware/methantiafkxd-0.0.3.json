      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware and information exfiltration tools. It collects sensitive user data such as browser cookies, saved passwords, Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Minecraft files, and system information (including Windows keys, hardware IDs, IP address, and geolocation). It decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows APIs and AES decryption, then writes this data to files in temporary directories. The code then compresses these files and exfiltrates them to attacker-controlled Discord webhooks and other remote endpoints without user consent or notification. It also includes clipboard monitoring and replacement functionality targeting cryptocurrency wallet addresses, a common tactic to hijack crypto transactions. The malware attempts to hide its window, kill Discord-related processes, and install itself to run on startup. It uses obfuscated variable and function names, multiple threading for stealth and concurrency, and fetches additional malicious payloads from remote URLs (e.g., GitHub raw URLs) to inject into Discord client files. The presence of hardcoded Discord webhook URLs, extensive environment reconnaissance, anti-debugging and anti-VM checks, and automated data exfiltration all confirm the code's malicious intent. The code runs automatically on execution without user interaction, further confirming its nature as malware."
