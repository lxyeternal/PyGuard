      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, indicating stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. This behavior is strongly indicative of malicious intent, as it involves obfuscated code execution in a hidden process without user interaction or notification. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code to run during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell execution in the installation context is a critical risk indicator of malware."
