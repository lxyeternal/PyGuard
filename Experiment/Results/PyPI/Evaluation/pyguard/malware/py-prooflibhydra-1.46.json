      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the embedded URL-like string in the comment and the encoded command itself. This execution happens automatically during the setup script execution without any user interaction or consent. The presence of obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell commands executed silently, combined with the use of subprocess to spawn hidden processes, is a classic hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks or installer-based payload delivery. The rest of the setup code appears benign, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution is sufficient to classify this code as malicious."
