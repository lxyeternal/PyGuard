      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a credential stealer targeting Roblox accounts. It uses the 'browser_cookie3' library to silently extract Roblox cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers without user consent. It then validates the cookie using the 'robloxpy' library and, if valid, collects detailed user account information such as UserID, RAP, friends count, account age, creation date, username, Robux balance, premium status, and profile URLs. It also retrieves the victim's public IP address. All this sensitive information, including the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie (which can be used to hijack the Roblox account), is exfiltrated by sending it via HTTP POST to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL controlled by the attacker. The script runs automatically without user interaction or notification, and it exits if the cookie is invalid, preventing further execution. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious code, including unauthorized credential theft, silent data exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints, use of browser cookie extraction, and absence of legitimate user consent or business logic."
