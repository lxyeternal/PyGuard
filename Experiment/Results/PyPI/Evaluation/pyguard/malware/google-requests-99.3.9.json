      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command during its run that sends an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eot0n2yp3autvqq.m.pipedream.net) using curl. The request headers and data include sensitive system information such as the hostname, current user (whoami), current working directory (pwd), directory listing (ls -la), and user identity information (id). This behavior constitutes automated, non-interactive collection and exfiltration of system and user environment data without user consent or legitimate purpose. The use of subprocess.run with shell=True to execute this command further indicates potential for arbitrary command execution. Such automated environment discovery and data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled endpoint is a hallmark of malicious activity, commonly observed in supply chain attacks, credential theft, or reconnaissance malware. There is no benign justification for this pattern in typical Python code, especially given the hardcoded suspicious webhook URL and the nature of the collected data."
