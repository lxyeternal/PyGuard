It then makes the script executable and runs it with specific arguments. Additionally, it runs shell commands to update the package list and install 'tmux' without user confirmation. This pattern of downloading and executing remote code during a package installation or post-install step, especially from an untrusted external source, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The absence of any validation, integrity checks, or user notification, combined with the execution of arbitrary shell code fetched from a remote server, aligns with known supply chain attack vectors and remote code execution malware patterns. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads shell scripts from a hardcoded, non-standard external URL (https://fhost.devxops.eu.org/devops/cicd/inits-v4/hostid/) using a fixed or user-supplied ID, then executes the downloaded content directly as shell commands without any validation or sanitization. This dynamic retrieval and execution of potentially untrusted remote code is a classic and strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the host system. The script also attempts to run some scripts with root privileges (via sudo or by setting effective UID), which can lead to privilege escalation or system compromise. There is no user interaction, consent, or integrity checks before executing the downloaded scripts, increasing the risk of executing malicious payloads. The use of subprocess.run with shell=True on remote content further amplifies the risk of command injection or execution of harmful commands. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote code download and execution, privilege escalation attempts, and lack of validation or user consent."
