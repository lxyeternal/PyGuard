      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It collects extensive sensitive user data including system information (username, computer name, Windows key, hardware ID, IP address, geolocation), browser data (passwords, cookies, history, credit card info), Discord tokens, Minecraft and Roblox credentials, and clipboard contents. It uses obfuscated and encoded data, decrypts browser-stored secrets using Windows APIs, and exfiltrates this data to attacker-controlled endpoints (notably https://kekwltd.ru/relay and hardcoded Discord webhooks). The code also attempts to evade detection by killing Discord-related processes, bypassing protections, and checking for virtual machine or analysis environments. It installs numerous Python packages silently, runs background threads for continuous clipboard monitoring and address replacement (cryptocurrency address hijacking), and uploads collected data in zipped archives. The presence of hardcoded attacker URLs, use of AES decryption on browser data, clipboard hijacking, and stealthy persistence mechanisms (copying itself to startup folders) further confirm malicious intent. Overall, this code is a sophisticated credential stealer and data exfiltration malware targeting Windows users."
