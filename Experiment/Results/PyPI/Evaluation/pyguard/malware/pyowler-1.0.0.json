      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Inside this method, it contains a large obfuscated string and a long numeric string. The code then performs a character-wise XOR deobfuscation between these two strings to reconstruct a hidden payload. This payload is then executed dynamically using eval(compile(...)). This pattern of obfuscation combined with dynamic code execution during package installation is a hallmark of malicious behavior, commonly used in supply chain attacks to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system without user consent. The obfuscation hides the true intent of the code, and the use of eval on dynamically generated code is a critical risk indicator. There is no legitimate reason for such obfuscation and execution in a setup install hook, and no user interaction or notification is present. Therefore, this code is malicious."
