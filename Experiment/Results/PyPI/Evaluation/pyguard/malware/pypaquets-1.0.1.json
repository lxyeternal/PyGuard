      "malicious_behavior": "The code is obfuscated by encoding a Python script as a list of ASCII codes, which is then decoded and executed via exec. The decoded script imports multiple modules commonly used in malware (e.g., socket, urllib.request, os, shutil, winreg, requests, pip) and defines a list of package names, then calls pip.main(['install', package]) for each package, which is unusual and suspicious behavior during runtime. It defines a function send_discord_info() that fetches data from a hardcoded suspicious URL (https://pastebin.pl/view/raw/e0db51a5), reads the content, writes it to a file named 'WindowsDefender.py' in the user's home directory, and then executes it. This sequence of downloading code from an untrusted remote source, writing it to disk, and executing it without user consent is a classic malware behavior pattern. The code also runs automatically during package installation (setup call), which is a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of network communication to suspicious URLs, dynamic code execution from remote sources, obfuscation, and execution during install time strongly indicate malicious intent. Therefore, this code contains multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including remote code execution, code obfuscation, and unauthorized network activity."
