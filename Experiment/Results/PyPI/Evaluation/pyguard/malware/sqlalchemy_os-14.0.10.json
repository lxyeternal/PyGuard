      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. After the standard setuptools setup call, it checks for the existence of a file named 'hifromDreamyOak' and exits if present, which is a stealth or evasion technique. It then imports 'requests', 'tempfile', 'subprocess', and 'base64', all commonly used in malware for network communication, temporary file handling, process execution, and obfuscation. The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed immediately via exec(). The decoded payload performs a GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/accounts/1109465188433936425/Windows.exe), which appears to be a direct download link for an executable file. It then uses tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile with delete=False, likely to save the downloaded content, and calls subprocess.call() with the content of the response, presumably to execute the downloaded file. This sequence—downloading an executable from a remote, non-official URL and executing it without user consent—is a classic hallmark of malware, specifically a downloader or remote code execution payload. The use of base64 encoding to hide the payload, the lack of user interaction or notification, and the execution of arbitrary code during package installation (setup script) further confirm malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious and likely part of a supply chain attack or malware distribution mechanism."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1109115014054416495/1109465188433936425/Windows.exe) without any validation or user consent, writes it to a temporary file, and immediately executes it using subprocess.call. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, as it enables remote code execution of potentially untrusted and harmful binaries. The absence of any user interaction, integrity checks, or notification, combined with the direct download and execution of a binary from an external source, strongly indicates malicious intent. Such behavior is commonly used for payload delivery, malware propagation, or system compromise."
