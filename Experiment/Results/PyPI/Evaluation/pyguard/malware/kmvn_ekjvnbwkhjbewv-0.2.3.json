      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the OS name and version, current working directory, hostname, and the logged-in username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious, and obfuscated external URL. This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of host environment data without user consent or notification. The use of a non-standard, attacker-controlled domain for data transmission is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with credential-stealing or system fingerprinting malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and exfiltration, making this code a clear example of malicious behavior."
