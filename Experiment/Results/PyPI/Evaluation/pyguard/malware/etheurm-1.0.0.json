      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Within this method, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec(). The encrypted payload is decrypted using Fernet symmetric encryption with a hardcoded key and then executed immediately during the package installation process. This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The obfuscated class name and the use of encrypted payload executed without user consent or interaction strongly indicate malicious intent. The package name 'etheurm' is suspiciously similar to 'ethereum', suggesting possible typosquatting. The code executes arbitrary code during installation, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine, potentially allowing for further payload delivery, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
