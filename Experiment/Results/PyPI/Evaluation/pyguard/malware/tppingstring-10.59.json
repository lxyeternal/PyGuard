      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to run it silently without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell process, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is executed during import or installation time, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during package setup, combined with the lack of user interaction or legitimate business logic, strongly indicates malicious behavior."
