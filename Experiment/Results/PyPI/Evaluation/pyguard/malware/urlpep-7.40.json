      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string. The command is executed with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. This pattern of using base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, often used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary or malicious payloads. Additionally, this execution occurs immediately upon import or setup, without any user interaction or notification, which is suspicious. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during setup strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery embedded in the package installation process. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
