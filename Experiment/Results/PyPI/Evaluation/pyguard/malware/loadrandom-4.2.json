      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then launches this hidden PowerShell command, which is obfuscated and likely executes unauthorized or harmful actions. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware embedded in Python packages. The use of try/except to silently suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is used as a cover for the malicious payload execution during installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
