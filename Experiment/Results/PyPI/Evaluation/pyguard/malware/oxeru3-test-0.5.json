      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a Python package setup script that hijacks the installation process by overriding the install command to run a function 'createfile' immediately after installation. This function collects sensitive system information including OS details, platform, and the host IP address, as well as the system uptime from '/proc/uptime'. It then establishes a raw TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 80 and sends this collected information without any user consent or notification. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data collection and exfiltration during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The use of setuptools install hook to execute code that contacts an external server and sends system fingerprinting data is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the external IP is hardcoded, which further supports the conclusion that this code is designed for covert data exfiltration and is malicious."
