      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution of decrypted code during installation strongly indicate a supply chain attack vector. The package name 'ethereium' is suspiciously similar to 'ethereum', suggesting typosquatting. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook, further indicating the intent to execute hidden code. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the code executes arbitrary code fetched from the encrypted blob, which could perform any malicious action. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
