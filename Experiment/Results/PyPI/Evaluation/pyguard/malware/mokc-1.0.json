It then immediately executes this downloaded file using a shell command without any user interaction, consent, or validation. This behavior is triggered automatically during the package setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The combination of network retrieval of an untrusted binary and its immediate execution is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The code also restricts execution to Windows platforms, indicating targeted malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the package metadata is generic and suspicious. These factors collectively indicate that the code contains malicious behavior."
