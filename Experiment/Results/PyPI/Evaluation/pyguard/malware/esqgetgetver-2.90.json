      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a hidden PowerShell window executing a base64-encoded command. This command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of subprocess to spawn PowerShell with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests evasion or conditional execution behavior. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during the package setup or import phase is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware embedded in Python packages. There is no legitimate reason for such obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution in a setup script, and no user consent or interaction is required. Therefore, this code is malicious."
