      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It includes extensive use of base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and executed dynamically via exec, which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique used by malware. The code performs environment discovery, collects sensitive information such as user identity, system details, and potentially browser cookies, and exfiltrates this data to hardcoded, suspicious external IP addresses and domains. It also downloads and executes additional code from remote sources without user consent, including during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed in hidden windows, the use of threading for stealthy background execution, and the manipulation of system and user directories further confirm its malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily gather information, execute arbitrary code, and communicate with attacker-controlled infrastructure, constituting a high-risk security threat."
