      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated execution or detection. The PowerShell command is executed silently (hidden window) without user interaction or notification, which is a typical stealth behavior. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate Python package installation script. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy subprocess spawning, and conditional execution during package setup strongly indicates this code is designed for malicious purposes, such as executing hidden payloads or establishing persistence on the victim system."
