      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for evasion and payload delivery. The base64-encoded command likely contains a PowerShell script that performs unauthorized or harmful actions, such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or data exfiltration. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means the malicious payload executes automatically during package installation without user consent or interaction, a classic supply chain attack vector. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further hiding malicious activity. These behaviors align strongly with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious Python code, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
