      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The package name 'selemiumm' appears suspicious and possibly typosquatted. The obfuscated class name and the use of encrypted code executed during installation strongly indicate an attempt to hide malicious payload delivery. The code executes arbitrary code on the user's system during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
