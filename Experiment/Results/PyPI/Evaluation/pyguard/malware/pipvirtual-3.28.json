      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), which is a known stealth technique. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection. The use of an encoded PowerShell command executed silently during package setup or installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is used here as a cover to execute the malicious payload during installation. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful commands on the victim's system without consent, which is malicious behavior."
