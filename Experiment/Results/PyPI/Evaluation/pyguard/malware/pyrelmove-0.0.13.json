      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Brave) for the domain 'roblox.com' without user consent. It gathers system information such as hostname, IP address, and username, then writes this data along with the stolen cookies to a local file in a hidden directory under the user's Documents folder. Subsequently, it exfiltrates this information by sending it to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an attacker-controlled external endpoint. The code runs this data collection and exfiltration loop every 3 hours automatically without any user interaction or notification. The use of browser_cookie3 to programmatically extract cookies, combined with automated, repeated exfiltration to a remote webhook, is a classic pattern of credential-stealing malware. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL, stealthy file creation, and continuous background operation further confirm malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious token grabber and credential stealer targeting Discord and Google Chrome user data. It collects sensitive information including Discord authentication tokens, Chrome saved passwords, and cookies by decrypting Chrome's encrypted data using the system's master key. It also takes a screenshot of the victim's screen. The stolen data is saved into files in a temporary directory, which are then zipped and exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user consent or notification. The code forcibly kills Discord processes and modifies Discord's local files to inject malicious code that points to the attacker's webhook, enabling persistent token theft. It also attempts to bypass BetterDiscord protections by modifying its files. The use of environment variables to locate sensitive directories, decryption of encrypted credentials, automated data collection, and silent exfiltration to an attacker-controlled webhook are classic hallmarks of malware. The code operates entirely without user interaction, performs destructive actions (process termination, file overwrites), and sends stolen credentials and system information to an external server, confirming its malicious intent."
