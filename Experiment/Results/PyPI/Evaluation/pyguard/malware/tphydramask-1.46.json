      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window hidden and uses the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible console window, a typical stealth technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard setup call for a Python package, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution during import or setup is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code executes during package installation or import without user consent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated base64-encoded command execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup, all of which are strongly associated with malware."
