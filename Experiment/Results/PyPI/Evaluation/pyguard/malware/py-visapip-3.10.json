      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell command). This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command, the check for a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution), and the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) strongly suggest stealthy, unauthorized code execution. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware that attempts to execute hidden payloads or perform unauthorized actions during package installation or execution. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
