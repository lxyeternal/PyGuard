      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed during the setup script, combined with the check for a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution), is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, or system compromise. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and the commented URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) further suggest malicious intent. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package installation is a well-known malware technique to evade detection and gain persistence or execute arbitrary code. Therefore, this code is malicious."
