      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. The use of Base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with silent execution in the background without user interaction or notification, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern is commonly observed in malware to execute payloads stealthily, evade detection, and potentially download or run further malicious code. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during import or setup is suspicious and characteristic of supply chain or installation-time malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
