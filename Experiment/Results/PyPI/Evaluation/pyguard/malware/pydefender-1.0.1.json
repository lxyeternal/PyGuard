      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using hexadecimal escape sequences and base64 encoding, which is a common technique used to hide malicious intent. It dynamically imports modules and functions using eval and compile, then decodes and decompresses large base64-encoded payloads that are immediately executed. The code includes functions that decode and execute data, and it uses obfuscated variable and function names to evade detection. The presence of base64 decoding followed by immediate execution (via eval or exec) is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. Additionally, the code appears to perform environment discovery and likely exfiltrates or executes hidden payloads without user interaction or consent. These characteristics align with known malware patterns such as remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using hexadecimal string encoding, base64 decoding, and dynamic evaluation (eval, compile). It imports modules and functions dynamically and decodes large base64-encoded payloads that are then decompressed and executed at runtime. The code constructs and executes shell commands with obfuscated parameters, uses threading, and performs decoding of data that appears to be executable code. The presence of multiple layers of decoding and execution, combined with obfuscated variable and function names, is a classic hallmark of malware attempting to evade static analysis. The code also appears to collect environment or system information and execute arbitrary code without user interaction or consent. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns such as remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential data exfiltration. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
