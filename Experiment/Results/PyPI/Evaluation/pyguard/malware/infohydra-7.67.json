      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated PowerShell payloads, often used by malware to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is a common obfuscation method to hide the true intent of the command. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution happens automatically during the setup script execution, which is a classic supply chain attack vector to run malicious code during package installation without user consent or interaction. The rest of the setup call appears normal but is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, possibly to avoid raising suspicion. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script, executed silently and conditionally, is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
