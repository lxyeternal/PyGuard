      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding, eval, and dynamic decoding techniques. It imports and uses eval and exec on decoded and decompressed data, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code dynamically decodes a large base64-encoded payload and executes it without any validation or user interaction. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware that hides its true functionality to evade detection. The obfuscation and immediate execution of decoded data strongly suggest that the code is designed to execute hidden or unauthorized payloads, potentially for data exfiltration, credential theft, or remote code execution. The use of obfuscated variable and function names, combined with the decoding and execution of compressed data, aligns with known malicious behaviors such as supply chain attacks, automated payload delivery, and stealthy execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
