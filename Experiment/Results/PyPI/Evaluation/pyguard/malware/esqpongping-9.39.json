      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed immediately during the import/setup phase, combined with the check for a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution), is a classic stealth technique used by malware. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads or performing system modifications. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious names ('esqpongping', 'EsqueleSquad') and an email address that do not correspond to known legitimate projects, which is typical in supply chain attacks. The overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including obfuscated command execution during package installation, stealth execution, and lack of user consent or transparency."
