      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell commands executed silently is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution during import or setup is suspicious and malicious. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and malware that execute arbitrary code during package installation or import."
