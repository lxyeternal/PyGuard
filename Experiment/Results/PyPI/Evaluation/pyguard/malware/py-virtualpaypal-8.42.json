      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a typical evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name ('py-virtualpaypal') with an author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raise suspicion. The code runs this potentially harmful command during the setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. These factors combined—obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth execution flags, suspicious naming, and execution during package installation—are hallmark signs of malicious intent."
