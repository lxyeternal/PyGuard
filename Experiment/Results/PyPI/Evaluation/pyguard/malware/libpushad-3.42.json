      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, enabling stealthy background execution. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled entity. The setup() call appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except pass block, which may be used to suppress errors and hide malicious activity during package installation. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware that executes payloads during installation without user consent."
