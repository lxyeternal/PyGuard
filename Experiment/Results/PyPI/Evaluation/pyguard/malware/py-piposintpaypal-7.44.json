      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe', which is highly suspicious and typical of malware payload delivery. The presence of a directory existence check ('tahg') before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. The package name 'py-piposintpaypal' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and possibly typosquatted or fake. The code runs this malicious payload during the setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with spawning a hidden PowerShell process to execute a remote payload is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution, persistence, and potential further compromise. Therefore, this code is malicious."
