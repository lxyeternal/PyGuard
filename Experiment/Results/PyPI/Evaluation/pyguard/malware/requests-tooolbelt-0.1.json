      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions that decode strings dynamically, which is a common evasion technique in malware. It conditionally imports modules like 'pip' and 'win32com', attempts to create and write files in user environment directories (e.g., paths derived from environment variables), and uses Windows COM interfaces to create and save shortcuts. The code also performs directory walking and file operations targeting specific file extensions, likely to propagate or execute payloads. The presence of a setup() call with a suspicious package name 'requests-tooolbelt' (typosquatting 'requests-toolbelt') suggests a supply chain attack vector. The code executes during installation (in setup context), which is a known malware tactic to run malicious payloads without user consent. These behaviors—obfuscation, environment discovery, file creation in user/system directories, COM shortcut manipulation, and execution during package installation—are strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with credential theft, persistence, or payload delivery malware."
