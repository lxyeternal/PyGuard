      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a directory existence check ('tahg') before launching the command suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further indicate suspicious origins. The use of distutils setup with a suspicious package name 'selfpostver' and author 'EsqueleSquad' is consistent with supply chain attack patterns where malicious code is executed during package installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy subprocess creation, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates malicious behavior."
