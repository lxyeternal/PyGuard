      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This obfuscation technique (base64-encoded PowerShell command) is a well-known method to hide the true intent of the command and evade detection. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), which is typical for stealthy malware. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to facilitate installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, and lack of legitimate purpose strongly indicates this code is malicious."
