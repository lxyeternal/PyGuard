      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function 'hello' that executes a base64-decoded string using exec. The decoded payload imports socket, struct, and time modules, then attempts to create a socket connection to IP address 172.16.60.80 on port 9009. It then enters a loop receiving data, executing it, and sending back the result. This behavior is characteristic of a remote code execution backdoor or reverse shell, allowing arbitrary code execution from a remote attacker without user interaction or consent. The use of base64 encoding to hide the payload and immediate execution via exec is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate business logic or user notification and instead establishes a covert network connection for remote command execution, which is a hallmark of malware."
