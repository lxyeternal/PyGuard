      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for evasion and to execute arbitrary or malicious payloads without user awareness. The base64-encoded command is not directly visible, which is a form of obfuscation. Additionally, this execution happens automatically during the setup script execution, which is a classic supply chain attack vector where malicious code runs during package installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscated payload strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
