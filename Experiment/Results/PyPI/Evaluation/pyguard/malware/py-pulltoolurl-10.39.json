      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally based on the absence of a directory named 'tahg' suggests stealthy execution and potential payload delivery or system compromise. This pattern—obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup—is a well-known hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading and running further malicious payloads. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup, which is a common supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code is malicious."
