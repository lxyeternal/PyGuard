      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://194.163.191.205:6963/builds/Netflix_Checker.exe) and saves it to the user's Documents directory without any user interaction or consent. Immediately after downloading, it executes the downloaded file using os.startfile. This sequence of downloading and executing a remote binary without validation or user notification is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. The use of a direct IP address rather than a reputable domain, combined with the lack of any integrity checks or user prompts, strongly indicates malicious intent."
