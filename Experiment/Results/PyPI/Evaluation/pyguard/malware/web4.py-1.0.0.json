      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This decrypted code is not visible in the source and is executed silently during package installation without user interaction or consent. The use of exec() on decrypted data during install is a classic supply chain attack pattern enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The obfuscated class name, the presence of encrypted payload, and execution during install strongly indicate malicious intent. The package setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in this hidden payload execution context. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as code obfuscation, dynamic code execution during install, and lack of user notification, all hallmark signs of malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
