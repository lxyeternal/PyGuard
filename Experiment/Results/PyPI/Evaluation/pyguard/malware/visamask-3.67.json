      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a strong indicator of stealthy, potentially malicious behavior, as it allows execution of arbitrary PowerShell commands without user visibility. This pattern is a well-known hallmark of malware, often used for downloading and executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, enabling code execution during package installation without user consent. The package name 'visamask' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' do not correspond to known legitimate software, increasing suspicion. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands during installation is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
