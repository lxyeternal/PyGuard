      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it runs obfuscated PowerShell code silently without user interaction or notification. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and analysis. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this hidden PowerShell process, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or unnecessary runs. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with encoded commands are hallmark signs of stealthy malicious behavior. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover or decoy. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in hidden mode, lack of user consent, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
