      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Within this method, it checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and immediately executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a hardcoded byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. This pattern of embedding encrypted code and executing it at install time is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The package name 'Matplotvlib' is a typo-squatted variant of the legitimate 'matplotlib' package, which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The code executes arbitrary code during installation without user consent or interaction, which can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The use of obfuscated class names and encrypted payload further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and consistent with known malware patterns involving malicious payload execution during package installation."
