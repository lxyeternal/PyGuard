      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. Inside the run() method, it contains a large obfuscated string and a numeric key string. It performs a character-wise XOR decryption of the obfuscated string using the numeric key, then immediately executes the decrypted code using eval(compile(...)). This pattern of obfuscation combined with dynamic code execution during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it allows execution of hidden arbitrary code on the user's system without consent or transparency. The use of obfuscated variable names and the suppression of exceptions further indicate an attempt to evade detection. Executing arbitrary code during installation is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate reason for such obfuscation and dynamic execution in a simple package setup script. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
