      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: 1) It installs a large number of Python packages silently without user interaction, including suspicious or uncommon packages. 2) It copies the 'Cryptodome' package directory to 'Crypto', a known technique to bypass certain import issues but also used in malware for cryptographic operations. 3) It writes a Python script ('pl.py') containing an obfuscated payload that decrypts and executes code using the 'fernet' module with a hardcoded key and encrypted data, indicating code obfuscation and hidden payload execution. 4) It launches this script in a hidden subprocess with no window, a stealth technique. 5) It attempts to download a Python script ('run.py') from a suspicious external URL ('https://kekwltd.ru/run.py') and writes it to the Windows startup folder, ensuring persistence by running on system startup. 6) It sets the downloaded file as hidden and attempts to execute it immediately in a hidden subprocess. 7) The combination of environment variable usage to locate user directories, obfuscated code execution, remote code download and execution, and persistence mechanisms strongly align with known malware behaviors such as remote code execution, persistence, and potential data exfiltration or system compromise. Therefore, this code is malicious."
