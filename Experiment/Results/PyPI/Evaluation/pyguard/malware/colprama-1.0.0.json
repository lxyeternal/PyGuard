      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary code during package installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). Specifically, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The obfuscated encrypted payload conceals the true nature of the executed code, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the package name and metadata appear nonsensical and obfuscated, further suggesting malicious intent. Executing arbitrary code during installation, especially code fetched or decrypted at runtime, is a critical risk and a common vector for malware delivery and remote code execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
