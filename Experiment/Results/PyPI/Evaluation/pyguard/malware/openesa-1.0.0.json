      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Inside this method, it checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded string and decrypted at install time, then executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the presence of encrypted payload executed without user consent, and the execution triggered automatically during installation strongly indicate malicious intent. The code also requests network-related modules and executes hidden code on Windows systems, which is suspicious. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the decrypted code is not visible, preventing static analysis. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, dynamic code execution during install, and potential remote code execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
