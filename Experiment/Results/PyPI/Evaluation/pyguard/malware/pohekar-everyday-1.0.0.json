      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a setuptools setup script that overrides the install command to execute arbitrary shell commands during package installation. Specifically, it base64-decodes a string (placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE') and immediately passes the decoded string to os.system(), which executes it as a shell command. This pattern of base64-encoded command execution during package installation is a classic hallmark of malicious Python packages and supply chain attacks. The code executes without user interaction or consent, leveraging the install hook to run potentially harmful commands on the victim's system. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the actual command further indicates malicious intent. This behavior enables remote code execution and can be used to deliver payloads, exfiltrate data, or compromise the system during package installation."
