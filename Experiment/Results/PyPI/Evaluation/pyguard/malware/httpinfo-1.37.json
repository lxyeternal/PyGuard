      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed immediately upon import or setup, combined with the check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution), is a classic malware pattern. This technique is commonly used for stealthy execution of malicious payloads, persistence, or downloading and executing further malicious code. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command and the execution of this command during the setup phase (package installation) strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malicious package behavior. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
