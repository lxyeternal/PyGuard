      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only if it does not exist, it executes the PowerShell command, indicating a stealthy conditional execution pattern. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, the hidden execution, and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user consent strongly indicate malicious intent. Additionally, the author and email fields in the setup call reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which are suspicious and may be linked to malware authorship. The overall pattern matches known supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation, leveraging setup scripts to run hidden payloads. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
