      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only then executes the PowerShell command, which is a common evasion technique. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during the setup process is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading and executing further payloads. Additionally, the package metadata and author information appear suspicious (e.g., author_email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' and the package name 'esqcpurand'), which may be typosquatted or malicious. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is highly likely to be malicious, leveraging a supply chain attack vector by executing hidden PowerShell commands during package installation."
