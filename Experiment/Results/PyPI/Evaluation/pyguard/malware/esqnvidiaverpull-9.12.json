      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the 'Hidden' window style and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'Windo​wsCache.exe' from that URL. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and runs a payload without user consent or interaction. Additionally, the package name 'esqnvidiaverpull' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and unrelated to the described functionality, suggesting a typosquatted or malicious package. The use of try/except blocks to silently suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated remote payload during installation or execution, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery."
