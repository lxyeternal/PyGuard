      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally based on the absence of a directory named 'tahg' suggests stealthy execution and potential persistence or payload delivery. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command is a classic obfuscation technique to evade detection. Additionally, the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raise suspicion. The rest of the code is a setup call for a package with a suspicious name 'py-supervirtualmc' and author 'EsqueleSquad', which may be a cover for the malicious payload. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and lack of legitimate user interaction or business logic strongly indicates malicious intent."
