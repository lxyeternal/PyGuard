      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions that decode strings dynamically. It performs conditional checks on command-line arguments and platform, then enters loops with large obfuscated numeric conditions. Within these loops, it imports modules like 'pip' and 'win32com.client.Dispatch', attempts to create and write files in user environment directories (e.g., paths derived from environment variables), and creates Windows shortcuts. It also checks for administrative privileges and performs file system operations such as directory creation and file writing in user-specific or system-related paths. The code uses obfuscated string construction to hide its intent and dynamically executes code during package setup, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The behavior includes stealthy file creation, environment reconnaissance, privilege checks, and potential payload deployment without user consent or notification. These characteristics align strongly with malicious patterns such as persistence mechanisms, payload delivery, and system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
