      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates stealth execution without user notification. This behavior is highly suspicious and strongly associated with malicious activity, such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious code during package installation. The package name 'randpaypal' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' do not correspond to any known legitimate package and may be used to disguise malicious intent. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, conditional execution, and embedding in a setup script is a strong indicator of malicious behavior."
