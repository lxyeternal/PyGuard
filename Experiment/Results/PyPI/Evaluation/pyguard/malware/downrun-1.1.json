      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a remote URL using a shell command (curl) without any validation or user consent, then immediately executes the downloaded file using os.start. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious behavior because it automates retrieval and execution of potentially untrusted code from remote sources. The absence of any user interaction, validation, or error handling, combined with direct shell command execution and immediate process start, matches known malware patterns for payload delivery and execution. Such behavior is commonly used by malware to download and run malicious payloads, leading to system compromise."
