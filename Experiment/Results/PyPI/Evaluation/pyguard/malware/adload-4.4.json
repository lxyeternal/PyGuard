      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an -EncodedCommand argument. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell command, which is a well-known obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates an attempt to run the command stealthily without user notification or visible windows. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious payload delivery during package installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is benign by itself, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution during the setup phase strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, especially without user interaction or notification. Therefore, this code is malicious."
