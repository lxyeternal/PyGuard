      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, as indicated by the suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated command string. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. The rest of the code (the setup call) appears benign but is used as a cover or delivery mechanism. Therefore, this code is malicious."
