      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or performing system compromise. The use of obfuscation (Base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command, combined with silent execution during what appears to be a package setup script, is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The author and email fields referencing 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me' along with the commented URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' further suggest malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during package installation, a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks."
