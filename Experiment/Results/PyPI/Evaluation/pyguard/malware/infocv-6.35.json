      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string. The command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to run stealthily without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution to avoid repeated or detected runs. This behavior is typical of malware that executes hidden payloads during package installation or setup. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call wrapped in a try/except block, likely to mask the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution during installation, lack of user interaction, and stealth execution strongly indicate malicious intent."
