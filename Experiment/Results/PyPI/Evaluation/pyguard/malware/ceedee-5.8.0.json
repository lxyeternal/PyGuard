      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, logged-in username, contents of /etc/passwd (on Linux/macOS), OS information, current directory, and directory listing without any user interaction or consent. It then encodes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://rk8xxqzdug.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Test/response). This data exfiltration occurs automatically during the execution of the setup script, which is typically run during package installation. Such behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware. The code uses shell commands to gather sensitive environment data and immediately transmits it to an attacker-controlled server without any legitimate business logic or user notification. This pattern is strongly associated with malicious activity, specifically automated data exfiltration and system fingerprinting during package installation, which can lead to privacy violations, credential theft, and further compromise."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information without any user interaction or consent. It executes multiple shell commands to retrieve hostname, current user, contents of /etc/passwd (a sensitive file containing user account information), OS details, current directory, and directory listing. This data collection is done silently and automatically based on the OS detected. The retrieval of the /etc/passwd file on Unix-like systems is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as this file contains sensitive user account information that is often targeted by malware for credential theft or system reconnaissance. The code does not perform any legitimate business logic or user notification around this data collection, nor does it show any benign use case such as logging or configuration. Although the code snippet does not show explicit exfiltration (e.g., network transmission), the pattern of gathering sensitive environment and credential-related data without user consent is a hallmark of malware preparing for further exploitation or data exfiltration. According to the provided knowledge points, such behavior is a critical risk indicator of malicious activity."
