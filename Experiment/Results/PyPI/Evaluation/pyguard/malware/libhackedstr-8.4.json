      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated PowerShell command and the suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip'. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic hallmark of malware, often used in supply chain attacks to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system during package installation. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is used as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
