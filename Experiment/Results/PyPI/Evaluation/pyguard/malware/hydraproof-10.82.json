      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports subprocess and os modules and then checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists. If it does not exist, it immediately spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The use of subprocess.Popen to spawn PowerShell in hidden mode with an encoded command is a well-known indicator of malicious behavior, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads without user consent or notification. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, enabling execution of malicious code during package installation. The try-except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the setup call appears legitimate but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
