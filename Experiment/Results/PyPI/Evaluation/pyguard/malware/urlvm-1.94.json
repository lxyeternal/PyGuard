      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports subprocess and os modules and then checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists. If it does not exist, it launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW indicates an attempt to run the command stealthily without user notification or visible windows. This pattern of spawning a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a well-known hallmark of malicious behavior, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, this code is executed immediately upon import (or setup), without user interaction or consent, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
