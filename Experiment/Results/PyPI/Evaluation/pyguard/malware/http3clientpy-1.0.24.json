      "malicious_behavior": "The code fetches content from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://pettish-morning.000webhostapp.com/code.php) using an HTTP GET request without any user interaction or validation. It then base64-decodes the fetched content and immediately executes it using exec() in the global and local context. This pattern of downloading obfuscated code from an untrusted remote source and executing it dynamically is a classic and strong indicator of malicious behavior. The use of threading to run this code in the background further suggests an attempt to evade detection or run covertly. There is no indication of any legitimate purpose, user consent, or safety checks, making this code highly likely to be malicious."
