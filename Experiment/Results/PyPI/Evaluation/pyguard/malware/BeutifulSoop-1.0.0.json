      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Inside this method, it checks if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet with a hardcoded key. This decrypted payload is not visible in the source and is executed immediately during package installation without user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscated encrypted payload executed via exec() during installation is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, often used in supply chain attacks to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The package name 'BeutifulSoop' is a typo-squatted variant of 'BeautifulSoup', which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook. The encrypted payload and its execution during install, combined with obfuscation and lack of legitimate business logic, strongly indicate this code is malicious."
