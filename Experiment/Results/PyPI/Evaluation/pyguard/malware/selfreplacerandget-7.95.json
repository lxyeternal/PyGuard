      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to execute hidden, potentially harmful commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands, indicating an attempt to hide the true intent of the command. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this hidden PowerShell process, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and may be linked to malicious actors. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during import or setup is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery. The subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to avoid any visible console window, further indicating stealthy behavior. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate business logic justifying this hidden execution. Based on the knowledge points, the use of obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently during package setup is a definitive indicator of malicious behavior."
