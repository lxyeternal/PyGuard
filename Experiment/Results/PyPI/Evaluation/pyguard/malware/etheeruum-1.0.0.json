      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation without user consent or interaction. The obfuscated class name and the use of encrypted payload further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The package name 'etheeruum' is suspicious and likely a typosquat of 'ethereum', which is a common tactic in malicious PyPI packages. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook. The code executes arbitrary decrypted code only on Windows systems, indicating targeted malicious intent. Overall, this is a classic supply chain attack pattern where malicious code is executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution and potential further compromise."
