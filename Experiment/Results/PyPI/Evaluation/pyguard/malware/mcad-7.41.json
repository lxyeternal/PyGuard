      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The use of subprocess.Popen to run PowerShell with an encoded command in hidden mode is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it is commonly used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, this execution occurs at import time or setup time, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious packages that execute code during installation. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution alongside it strongly indicates malicious intent."
