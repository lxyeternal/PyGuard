      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence mechanism. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further indicate suspicious origins. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is used here as a cover to execute the malicious payload during installation or import. This pattern—executing obfuscated PowerShell commands in a hidden window during package setup—is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with supply chain attacks and stealthy payload delivery. Therefore, this code is malicious."
