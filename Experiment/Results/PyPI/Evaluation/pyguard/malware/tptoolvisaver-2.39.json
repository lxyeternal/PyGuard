      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and outputs it to a file named '~\\WindowsCache.exe', then executes it. This behavior is consistent with downloading and executing a remote payload without user consent or interaction, a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious author name 'EsqueleSquad' and email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', combined with the obfuscated PowerShell command and the use of a non-standard URL, further supports the malicious intent. The code attempts to execute this payload only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Overall, this code is a supply chain attack vector that downloads and executes a hidden remote executable during package installation, which is a critical risk and clearly malicious."
