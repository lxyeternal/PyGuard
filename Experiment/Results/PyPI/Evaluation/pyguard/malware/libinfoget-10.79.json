      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The PowerShell command runs in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden) and uses subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any console window, which is a stealth technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is executed before this, during import or setup invocation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands, hidden execution, conditional path checks, and lack of user interaction or notification are all strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with malware patterns such as stealthy code execution, persistence, or payload delivery."
