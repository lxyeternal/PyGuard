      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a binary file named 'node' from a suspicious, attacker-controlled GitHub URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/misbebra-lol/actions-test/main/node) and writes it to the /tmp directory without any user consent or validation. It also writes a configuration file 'config.json' to /tmp with settings that appear to configure mining software (e.g., 'mode': 'nicehash', 'pools' with an IP address and port). Then, it changes the permissions of the downloaded 'node' file to executable and immediately executes it with the '--nicehash' argument. This sequence of downloading an executable from an untrusted remote source, writing it to a temporary directory, and executing it silently is a classic malware behavior pattern, often associated with cryptomining malware or other unauthorized payloads. The code runs automatically during package setup without user interaction or notification, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The hardcoded IP address and port in the config further indicate connection to a potentially malicious mining pool. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including remote code retrieval and execution, silent installation of a potentially harmful binary, and execution of unauthorized payloads during package installation."
