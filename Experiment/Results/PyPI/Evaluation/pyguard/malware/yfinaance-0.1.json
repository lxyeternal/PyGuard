      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It performs platform checks and command-line argument checks to trigger different behaviors. The code imports modules like pip and win32com, attempts to create and write files in user directories (e.g., using environment variables like APPDATA), and uses COM objects to create and save shortcuts. It also walks through directories, searches for files with specific extensions, and manipulates them. The obfuscation and dynamic construction of strings, combined with file system modifications, environment variable usage, and COM automation, strongly indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be designed to execute during package setup, which is a known supply chain attack vector. These behaviors align with typical malware patterns such as persistence mechanisms, payload deployment, and potential data exfiltration or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
