      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command class that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The package name 'customtkiyter' appears suspicious and possibly typosquatted. The use of obfuscated class names and encrypted payloads executed during installation is a classic supply chain attack technique to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code executes arbitrary decrypted code, which could perform any malicious actions. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
