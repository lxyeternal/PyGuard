      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command class (GruppeInstall) that overrides the run() method to execute arbitrary decrypted code during package installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). It imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large base64-encoded payload and immediately executes it with exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The package name 'requetsts' is a typo-squatted variant of the legitimate 'requests' package, which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The obfuscated DESCRIPTION and LONG_DESCRIPTION strings further indicate an attempt to hide intent. The immediate execution of decrypted code during installation, combined with the use of a hardcoded cryptographic key and obfuscated payload, strongly indicates that the package is designed to run malicious code on the victim's system during installation, which is a critical risk behavior consistent with malware."
