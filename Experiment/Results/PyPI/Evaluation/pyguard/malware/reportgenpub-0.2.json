      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. Specifically, it hooks into the setuptools install command to run code automatically during package installation without user consent. It performs obfuscated operations using byte arrays and XOR-based decoding to construct URLs dynamically, which are not human-readable and are used to fetch remote payloads. The code downloads a binary payload from a remote URL determined by the platform architecture, writes it to the user's ~/.local/bin directory with executable permissions, and then executes it silently with output suppressed. This behavior is typical of malware that stages and executes secondary payloads. The use of cryptographic hashing and generator-based decoding to obfuscate the payload and URLs further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The code also scans local paths matching a pattern and uses a hash check to conditionally trigger the payload execution, which is a stealthy activation mechanism. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying these actions. The combination of obfuscated remote URL construction, network retrieval of executable code, writing to user directories, and silent execution during package installation is a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware."
