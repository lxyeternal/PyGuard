      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealth execution. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and attempts to invoke a web request to download or execute a payload silently. The presence of a directory existence check ('tahg') before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious author and package names ('EsqueleSquad', 'py-paypalultrapep') that do not correspond to legitimate libraries, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks. The code runs this malicious payload automatically during the setup process without user interaction or consent. These factors combined—obfuscated PowerShell command execution, hidden process spawning, suspicious external URL, and execution during package installation—are classic hallmarks of malware, specifically a supply chain attack or downloader malware."
