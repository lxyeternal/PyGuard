      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a temporary Python script that contains a command to download and execute code from a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://54.237.36.60/inject/QrvxFGKvsSJ5E5bx) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. It then attempts to execute this temporary script using the Python interpreter in a new process via os.system with a 'start' command, which on Windows launches a new window. This pattern of dynamically fetching and executing remote code without any user interaction or validation is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The use of a temporary file to stage the payload, the hardcoded external IP address, and the immediate execution of downloaded code without integrity checks or user consent strongly indicate that this code is designed for malicious purposes such as remote code injection, backdoor installation, or malware deployment."
