      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally based on the absence of a directory named 'tahg' suggests stealthy execution of potentially harmful code. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, as indicated by the suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscation technique. This pattern—obfuscated command execution via PowerShell in hidden mode during package setup—is a well-known hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks or backdoors embedded in Python packages. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script but contains this hidden malicious payload execution, confirming the code is malicious."
