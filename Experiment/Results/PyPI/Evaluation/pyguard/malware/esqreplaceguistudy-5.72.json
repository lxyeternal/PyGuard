      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally based on the absence of a directory named 'tahg' suggests stealthy execution and potential persistence or payload delivery. The comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of arbitrary code during package installation. These factors combined—obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, suspicious domain reference, and execution during package setup—are hallmark signs of malware."
