      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code implements a reverse shell, which is a classic malicious behavior. It creates a socket connection to a hardcoded remote host and port (6.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:13334), then redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to this socket. After that, it spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i) connected to the remote server. This allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the victim machine, effectively giving full control over the system. Such reverse shells are commonly used in malware, backdoors, and unauthorized remote access tools. The code runs automatically without any user interaction or consent, and connects to an external, attacker-controlled server, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
