      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution of decrypted code during installation strongly indicate a supply chain attack vector. The package name 'reuirements' is suspiciously similar to 'requirements' (a common package name), suggesting typosquatting. The code also specifies Windows as the target OS, which aligns with the conditional execution. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent involved, and the decrypted code is not visible, preventing static analysis of its true intent. This combination of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and execution during package installation is a critical risk indicator of malware."
