      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Windows systems. It collects sensitive information such as Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords, billing information, and user environment details without user consent. It decrypts Chrome/Chromium-based browser data using Windows DPAPI, extracts Discord tokens from local files, and collects user IP and geolocation data. The stolen data is exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL (https://webhook.wyvern.lol) and also uploaded to anonymous file hosting services. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, spawns multiple threads to stealthily gather data, kills processes to access locked files, and compresses data before exfiltration. It installs required dependencies silently if missing. The overall behavior matches known malicious patterns of information stealers, including environment reconnaissance, credential theft, data packaging, and exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the code operates covertly. Therefore, this code is malicious."
