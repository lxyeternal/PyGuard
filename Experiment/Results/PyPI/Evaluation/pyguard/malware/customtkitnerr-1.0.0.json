      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent or interaction. The package name 'customtkitnerr' appears suspicious and possibly typosquatted. The obfuscated class name and the use of encrypted payloads executed at install time are typical supply chain attack techniques. The code also specifies Windows as the target OS, indicating a targeted attack. Overall, this code exhibits hallmark signs of a malicious Python package designed to execute hidden payloads during installation."
