      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a persistence or evasion mechanism. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands in a setup script context further indicate a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during package installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears legitimate but is used here as a cover to execute the hidden malicious payload. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated code execution, stealthy process spawning, and execution during package installation without user consent."
