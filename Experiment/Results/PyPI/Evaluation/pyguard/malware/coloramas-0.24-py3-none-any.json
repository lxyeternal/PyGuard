      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive user data related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet by accessing multiple wallet-related files and configuration files from the user's AppData roaming directory and desktop/downloads/documents folders. It then compresses these files into a ZIP archive without user consent. The script gathers the victim's username and public IP address, constructs a message including a country flag emoji derived from the IP's country code, and sends both the message and the ZIP archive to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID via HTTP POST requests. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive wallet credentials and secrets to an attacker-controlled Telegram channel. The code operates silently without user interaction or notification, uses hardcoded attacker-controlled endpoints, and deletes the ZIP archive after sending to cover tracks. These are classic hallmarks of information-stealing malware designed to harvest cryptocurrency wallet data and exfiltrate it to a remote attacker."
