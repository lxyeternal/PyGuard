      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command, the check for a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution), and the use of subprocess to execute encoded commands in a stealthy manner are classic hallmarks of malware. Additionally, the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is used here as a cover or delivery mechanism. Overall, the code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated PowerShell commands during installation or execution, which is a known supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent."
