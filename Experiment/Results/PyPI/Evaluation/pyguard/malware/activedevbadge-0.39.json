      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that executes automatically during package installation. It performs multiple suspicious actions without user consent or notification: it creates directories inside the user's Windows Startup folder and another folder named 'Powerpoint' under the Start Menu Programs path, which are unusual and potentially deceptive locations. It then clones two GitHub repositories into these directories, one named 'test2lmaos' into the Startup\\boot folder and another named 'defonotagrabber' into the Powerpoint folder. After cloning, it moves a script named 'test.py' from the cloned 'test2lmaos' subfolder directly into the Startup folder, effectively placing a Python script to run on user login. Finally, it executes an executable 'main.exe' from the 'defonotagrabber' folder inside the Powerpoint directory. This sequence of actions—automatic cloning of remote repositories during install, placing scripts in the Windows startup folder for persistence, and executing an unknown executable—matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including supply chain attack patterns, persistence mechanisms, and remote code execution from untrusted sources. The lack of user interaction, the use of environment-derived paths to place executables and scripts in startup locations, and the immediate execution of a potentially untrusted binary strongly indicate malicious intent."
