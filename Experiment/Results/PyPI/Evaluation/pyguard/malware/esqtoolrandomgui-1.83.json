      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the obfuscated base64 string and the commented suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip). This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to execute hidden commands during package installation or setup without user consent or interaction. The presence of this obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. The rest of the code (the setup call) appears benign, but the subprocess invocation with encoded PowerShell command is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
