      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, upon installation, automatically downloads an executable file named 'DigitalPulse.exe' from a hardcoded, non-official URL ('https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe') without any user interaction or consent. It then writes this executable to the current working directory and immediately executes it using a shell command ('start DigitalPulse.exe') on Windows platforms. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malicious activity, specifically a supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code is fetched and executed during package installation. The absence of any validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic, combined with the automatic execution of a remote binary, strongly indicates malicious intent. Such patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are used to deliver and execute potentially harmful payloads, enabling remote code execution, system compromise, or further malware deployment."
