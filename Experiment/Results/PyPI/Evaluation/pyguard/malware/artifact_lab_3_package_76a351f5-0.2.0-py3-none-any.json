      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell that connects to a hardcoded external server (6.tcp.ngrok.io on port 14283) immediately upon execution without any user interaction or notification. It uses socket programming to redirect standard input/output/error to the socket and spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i), effectively giving remote command execution control to the external host. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware, specifically remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors, enabling attackers to gain unauthorized remote control over the victim system. The immediate execution of the reverse shell upon script run, absence of any legitimate business logic, and connection to an attacker-controlled domain strongly indicate malicious intent."
