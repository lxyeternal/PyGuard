      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded string that is decoded and immediately executed as a shell command during the package installation process (in the AfterInstall class's run method). The decoded command launches PowerShell with flags to run without a profile and execute a command that downloads and runs a script from a suspicious external URL hosted on raw.githubusercontent.com. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where arbitrary code is executed during package installation without user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the command, the automatic execution during install, and the download and execution of remote code from an untrusted source are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a high-risk indicator of remote code execution and potential system compromise."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded external URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe) and then runs it immediately without any user interaction, validation, or consent. This pattern of automatically fetching and executing a remote binary is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source. The use of subprocess.Popen to run the downloaded executable further confirms the intent to execute potentially harmful payloads. There is no indication of legitimate business logic, user notification, or security checks, which aligns with typical malware behavior such as payload delivery, remote code execution, or system compromise."
