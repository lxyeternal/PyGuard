      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a strong indicator of stealthy execution of obfuscated PowerShell code, a common technique used by malware to evade detection. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a known obfuscation method to hide the true intent of the command. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist before launching this hidden PowerShell process, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled identity. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious package installation scripts. There is no user interaction or notification before this hidden execution, and the subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating malicious intent. Therefore, this code is executing hidden, obfuscated commands during installation, which is a critical risk indicator of malware."
