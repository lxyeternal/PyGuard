      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install_scripts command class that, during installation, collects detailed environment information including the hostname, current working directory, local IP addresses, and public WAN IP address by querying external services. It then encodes this information into DNS query payloads sent to a hardcoded suspicious domain 'hte1ck6lvk1ktcuxl0x8jfgeu50vok.burpcollaborator.net' via DNS A record lookups using a specified DNS server (8.8.8.8). This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and network information without user consent or notification. The exfiltration via DNS queries to an attacker-controlled domain is a known covert channel technique used by malware to evade detection. Additionally, the code hooks into the package installation process (setup.py) to execute this data collection and exfiltration automatically when the package is installed, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The presence of hardcoded suspicious domains, network communication for data exfiltration, and execution during install time without user interaction are strong indicators of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system and network information including hostname, current working directory, local IP addresses, and public WAN IP address without any user interaction or consent. It then encodes this information into a DNS query format and sends it to a hardcoded suspicious domain 'hte1ck6lvk1ktcuxl0x8jfgeu50vok.burpcollaborator.net', which is a known attacker-controlled domain used for out-of-band interaction and data exfiltration. The use of DNS queries to exfiltrate data is a common covert channel technique in malware to bypass network monitoring. The code also uses a hardcoded DNS server (Google's 8.8.8.8) to send these queries. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the data collected is sensitive environment information that can be used for fingerprinting or further attacks. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns of automated data exfiltration and host reconnaissance, indicating that the code is malicious."
