      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used in malware to execute payloads silently during package installation or execution. The use of Base64 encoding to hide the command, the hidden window execution, and the lack of any legitimate user interaction or notification further confirm the malicious nature. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution alongside it strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism embedded in the package installation process."
