      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealth execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the payload, which is a typical evasion or persistence check. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled identity. The setup call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate Python package. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates this code is malicious."
