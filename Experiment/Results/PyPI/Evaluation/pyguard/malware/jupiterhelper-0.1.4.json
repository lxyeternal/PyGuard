      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file named 'helper.exe' from a URL and immediately executes it using subprocess.run without any validation, user interaction, or consent. The URL for the executable is dynamically fetched from a remote JSON API endpoint ('https://sleipnirbrowser.org/api/python/14526470/win'), which means the actual payload can be changed remotely by the attacker. This pattern of fetching a remote URL, downloading an executable, saving it to a local directory, and executing it directly is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The code lacks any integrity checks, digital signature verification, or user notification before executing the downloaded binary. Additionally, the function init_helper calls itself recursively with the download link, which appears to be a bug or obfuscation attempt, but the intent to download and execute remote code remains clear. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including automated file download and execution from untrusted sources, absence of user consent, and dynamic remote payload retrieval."
