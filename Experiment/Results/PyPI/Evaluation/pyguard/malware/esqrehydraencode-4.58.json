      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a strong indicator of stealthy execution of obfuscated code. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which is benign in isolation but here is used as a cover or delivery mechanism. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates malicious intent, likely for executing a hidden payload or performing unauthorized actions on the host system."
