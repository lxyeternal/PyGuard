      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects environment information by executing the shell command 'env' and reading its output, which can contain sensitive environment variables. It also lists files in the parent directory './../'. Then, it encodes this information as URL parameters and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL 'http://pt.traktrain.com/req.php' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes automated data collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information to an external server. Such silent environment discovery and data exfiltration during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The network communication is performed automatically at import or setup time, which is suspicious and not typical for benign packages. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
