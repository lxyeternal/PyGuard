      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including hostname, username, package name, and current working directory, encodes this data in base64, then further encodes it in hex format. It constructs domain names by appending this encoded data to a suspicious DNS domain ('.sub.deliverycontent.online') and performs multiple 'ping' commands to these domains, effectively sending data via DNS queries. Additionally, it sends HTTP POST and GET requests with the encoded data to a hardcoded suspicious domain ('www.deliverycontent.online') using multiple HTTP client libraries (urllib.request, requests, urllib). There is no user interaction or notification, and the data exfiltration is automated and obfuscated. The use of base64 encoding combined with hex encoding and sending data via DNS queries and HTTP requests to attacker-controlled domains is a classic data exfiltration technique. The package name is suspiciously named and the entire behavior matches known malware patterns of environment reconnaissance and covert data exfiltration without user consent. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
