      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a remote payload without user interaction or notification. The presence of a directory existence check ('tahg') before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command and the immediate execution of this command during the setup process (package installation) is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The package metadata contains suspicious author and package names that do not correspond to legitimate libraries. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden remote payload during installation, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
