      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated in base64 UTF-16LE encoding, which is a common technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed silently (hidden window style) without user interaction or notification. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup strongly indicates this code is designed to execute unauthorized or harmful actions on the host system."
