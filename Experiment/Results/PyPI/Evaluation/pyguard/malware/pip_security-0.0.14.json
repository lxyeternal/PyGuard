      "malicious_behavior": "The code hijacks the Python package installation process by overriding the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary shell commands that install and run a binary named 'pip_security' from a 'rootkit' directory. Specifically, during installation, it copies 'rootkit/dist/pip_security' to '/usr/local/bin/rootkit', runs 'rootkit/dist/pip_security install', and then executes 'rootkit &' in the background. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack or rootkit installation, as it silently installs and runs a potentially malicious binary without user consent or interaction. The use of shell commands in the install hook to deploy and run a hidden binary, combined with the naming 'rootkit', strongly suggests malicious intent aimed at persistence, stealth, or system compromise."
