      "malicious_behavior": "The code spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, indicating stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware technique. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This behavior is typical of malware that executes hidden payloads or performs unauthorized actions during package installation or setup. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during a setup script is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware delivery mechanisms. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses errors, which may be used to hide failures in malicious payload execution."
