      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute a reverse shell during package installation. Specifically, it creates a socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (39.101.72.63) on port 4242, then redirects the standard input, output, and error file descriptors to this socket, and finally spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i). This behavior enables an attacker to gain remote command execution on the victim's machine immediately upon installing the package, without any user interaction or consent. Such use of setuptools install hooks to execute network-connected shells is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is exclusively observed in malware samples. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled IP and port, network socket redirection to a shell, and execution during installation are all critical risk indicators of malicious intent."
