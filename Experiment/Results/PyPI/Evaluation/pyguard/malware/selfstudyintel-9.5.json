      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, a typical stealth technique. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled identity. The setup() call appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except pass block, which suppresses errors and may be used to mask malicious activity during package installation. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script, hidden execution, and conditional directory checks strongly indicate malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware installation routines."
