      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell, which is a classic malicious behavior. It creates a socket connection to a hardcoded external server (4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io) on a specified port (10308) and redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to this socket. Then it executes a bash shell command that opens an interactive shell over the network connection, effectively giving remote control of the victim machine to the attacker. This pattern is a definitive indicator of malware, specifically remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors, enabling an attacker to gain unauthorized remote command execution capabilities. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate business logic, and the code is designed to stealthily establish a remote shell, which is a high-risk malicious activity."
