      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential-stealing malware targeting Windows systems. It collects sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords, billing information, and user environment details without user consent. It uses Windows APIs to decrypt encrypted browser data (e.g., Chrome passwords and cookies) and extracts Discord tokens from various Discord client installations. The code then exfiltrates this stolen data to an attacker-controlled Telegram bot webhook URL. It also collects files from user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) searching for keywords related to accounts, passwords, and secrets, uploads these files to anonymous file hosting services, and sends the links to the attacker. The malware kills browser and Telegram processes to access locked files, compresses data into zip archives, and uploads them for exfiltration. It automatically installs required dependencies if missing, runs multiple threads for stealth and speed, and uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 decoding and AES decryption to extract credentials. The presence of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, use of Windows cryptographic APIs to decrypt browser data, automated data collection and exfiltration, and lack of any legitimate user interaction or notification confirm malicious intent. This code is a classic example of a Windows information stealer designed to harvest credentials and sensitive information for unauthorized use."
