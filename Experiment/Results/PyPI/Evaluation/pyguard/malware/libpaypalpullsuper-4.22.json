      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The PowerShell command runs in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden) and uses the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to suppress any console window, which is typical for stealthy execution. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name ('libpaypalpullsuper') with an author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raise suspicion. The setup call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks or malware installation routines."
