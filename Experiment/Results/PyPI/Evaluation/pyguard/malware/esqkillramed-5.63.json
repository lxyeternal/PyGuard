      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and outputs it to a file named '~\\/WindowsCache.exe', then executes it. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and executes a payload from a remote server without user consent or notification. Additionally, the package name 'esqkillramed' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and likely typosquatted or malicious. The use of try/except to silently suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The setup call appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is a classic example of a malicious Python package performing a supply chain attack by executing hidden PowerShell commands to download and run a remote executable."
