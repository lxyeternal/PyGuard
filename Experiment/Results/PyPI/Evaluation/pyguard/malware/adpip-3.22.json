      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware to evade detection. The base64-encoded command likely contains a PowerShell script that performs unauthorized or malicious actions, such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or data exfiltration. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The try/except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to hide malicious activity. The package metadata and naming ('adpip', 'modlib') appear generic and may be used to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window, conditional execution based on file system state, and embedding in a package setup script strongly indicates malicious behavior."
