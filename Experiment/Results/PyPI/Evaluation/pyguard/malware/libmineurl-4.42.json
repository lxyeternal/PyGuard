      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window, CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag), which is a classic technique used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary code without user consent or notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which may be a persistence or evasion mechanism. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands strongly suggest malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the embedded subprocess call with obfuscated PowerShell execution during import or installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware embedded in Python packages. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
