      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for privilege escalation, persistence, or payload delivery. The base64-encoded command is not decoded or inspected in the code, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation to hide malicious intent. Additionally, this execution occurs at import or setup time without user interaction or notification, which is suspicious and typical of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask errors and avoid detection. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script strongly indicates malicious behavior."
