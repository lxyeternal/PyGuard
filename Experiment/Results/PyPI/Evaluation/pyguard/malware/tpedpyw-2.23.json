      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to avoid repeated execution or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, which is a stealth technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, but the malicious payload is executed before it, during import or setup. This pattern of executing obfuscated PowerShell commands in a hidden window during package setup is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior."
