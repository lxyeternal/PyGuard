      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, as indicated by the suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip). The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with hidden PowerShell execution is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or persistence. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious author information and package naming that does not correspond to legitimate libraries, which is common in supply chain attacks. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious intent, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and potential remote payload execution."
