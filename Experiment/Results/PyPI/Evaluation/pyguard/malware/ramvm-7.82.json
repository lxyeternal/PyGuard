      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware that executes code during package installation. The rest of the code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution is suspicious and likely intended to run malicious code without user consent or notification. Therefore, this code is malicious."
