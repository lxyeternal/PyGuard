      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding, a common technique used by malware to hide its true purpose. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or repeated execution. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, ensuring stealthy execution without user notification. Additionally, the author and email fields in the setup call reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which are suspicious and may be linked to malicious actors. The presence of this obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling remote code execution and potentially further payload delivery or system compromise. No legitimate user interaction or notification is present, and the code suppresses errors silently, further indicating malicious intent."
