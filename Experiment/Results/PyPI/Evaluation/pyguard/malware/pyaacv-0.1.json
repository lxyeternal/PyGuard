      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary code during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Specifically, it downloads an executable file (CBLines.exe) from a hardcoded, external GitHub URL and saves it to the current working directory without any user consent or validation. After confirming the file exists, it immediately launches the downloaded executable using PowerShell's Start-Process. This behavior enables remote code execution of potentially untrusted and malicious payloads during package installation. The lack of user interaction, absence of integrity checks, and automatic execution of a downloaded binary are strong indicators of malicious intent. Such patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks, enabling attackers to deliver and run arbitrary code on victim systems."
