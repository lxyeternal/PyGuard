      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for evasion and to execute arbitrary or malicious payloads without user awareness. The base64-encoded command is not decoded or inspected in the source, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation to hide malicious intent. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The try-except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection or interruption. These factors combined—hidden PowerShell execution, base64 obfuscation, conditional execution based on file system state, and execution during package setup—are strong indicators of malicious behavior."
