      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during the setup process, combined with the suspicious package name 'py-guiloadhacked' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', strongly suggests malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behaviors such as stealthy code execution, obfuscation, and potential payload delivery or system compromise during package installation. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and should be treated as malicious."
