      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to execute hidden, potentially malicious PowerShell commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a known method to evade detection and hide the true intent of the command. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The presence of a suspicious author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) and a suspicious package name ('py-loadmine') further supports the malicious nature. The subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call wrapped in try/except, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and suspicious package metadata strongly indicates malicious behavior."
