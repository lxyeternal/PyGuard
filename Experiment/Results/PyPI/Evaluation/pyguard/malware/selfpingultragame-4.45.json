      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded and obfuscated, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting a stealth or persistence mechanism. The PowerShell command is executed with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, hiding its window from the user, which is a common evasion technique. The presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands strongly suggest that the code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the system. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation without user consent or interaction. These factors collectively indicate that the code contains malicious behavior."
