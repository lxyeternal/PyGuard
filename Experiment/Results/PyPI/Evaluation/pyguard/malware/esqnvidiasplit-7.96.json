      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a persistence or evasion mechanism. The PowerShell command runs with the window hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and uses subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to avoid user detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during the setup phase strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern is consistent with supply chain attacks or malware that executes payloads during package installation without user consent or interaction."
