      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known method for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads, often used in malware to avoid detection and execute arbitrary code. This behavior occurs automatically during the setup script execution, which is a classic supply chain attack vector where malicious code runs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The rest of the setup code appears benign, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
