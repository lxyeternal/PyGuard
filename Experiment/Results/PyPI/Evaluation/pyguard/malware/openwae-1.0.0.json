      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Within this method, it checks if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded byte string and decrypted at install time, then executed immediately without user interaction or consent. This pattern of decrypting and executing obfuscated code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The use of exec on decrypted data, combined with obfuscated class and variable names, and the execution triggered automatically during installation, strongly indicates malicious intent. The code attempts to run hidden or unauthorized code on the user's system during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
