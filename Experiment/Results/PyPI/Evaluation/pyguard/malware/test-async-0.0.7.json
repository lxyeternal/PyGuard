      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL (https://pastebin.com/raw/3xcr2My4), retrieves the content, and immediately uses it as a URL to send a POST request with a JSON payload containing 'new run @everyone', which suggests automated notification or signaling to an attacker-controlled endpoint. Then, it generates a random integer and writes the content fetched from another suspicious URL (https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode) into a newly created Python script file with a randomized name in the current directory. Immediately after, it spawns a subprocess to execute this downloaded script without any validation or user consent. This sequence of downloading code from untrusted remote sources, writing it to disk, and executing it dynamically is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The code is embedded in a setuptools setup script, which means this malicious activity could be triggered during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The author metadata ('hacker') and the suspicious URLs further reinforce the malicious intent. There is no legitimate user interaction, no validation of downloaded content, and no benign business logic between these operations. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
