      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification, and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide its execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as downloading or executing further payloads, as suggested by the suspicious URL embedded in the decoded command string (\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/107974949475150594048/Esquele.exe\"). This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands is a well-known malware technique for stealthy code execution, persistence, or payload delivery. Additionally, the code attempts to create a directory named 'tahg' as a marker to avoid repeated execution, which is typical in malware to maintain stealth and persistence. The presence of this behavior in a setup script further suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
