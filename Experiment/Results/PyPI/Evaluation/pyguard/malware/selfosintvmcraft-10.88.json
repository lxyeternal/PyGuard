      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to execute hidden, potentially malicious PowerShell commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a known method to evade detection and hide the true intent of the command. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this hidden PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade repeated detection or to target specific environments. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag further indicate stealthy execution. Additionally, the setup() call with a suspicious package name 'selfosintvmcraft' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appears to be a cover for the malicious payload execution during package installation. These behaviors align with known supply chain attack patterns where malicious code is executed during package installation to run hidden payloads. Therefore, this code exhibits strong indicators of malicious behavior, specifically stealthy execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands likely intended for unauthorized actions such as payload delivery, persistence, or system compromise."
