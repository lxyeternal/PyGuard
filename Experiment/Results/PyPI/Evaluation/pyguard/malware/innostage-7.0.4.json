It then executes the response text directly using exec(). This pattern of fetching and executing remote code at install time is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The code executes arbitrary code from an untrusted external source without any validation or user consent during the package setup process, which is highly suspicious and dangerous. This behavior enables attackers to run arbitrary malicious payloads on the victim's system during package installation, making it a critical security risk."

It then immediately executes the response text as Python code using exec(). This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious behavior because it enables arbitrary remote code execution without any validation, user interaction, or consent. The use of exec() on remotely fetched code is a classic malware technique for payload delivery, remote control, or data exfiltration. The domain is not a known trusted source, and the code does not perform any integrity checks or sandboxing. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as fetching and executing code from untrusted external sources, lack of user notification, and direct execution of arbitrary code, all of which are hallmarks of malware."
