      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally based on the absence of a directory named 'tahg' suggests stealthy execution and potential persistence or payload delivery. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command is a classic obfuscation technique to evade detection. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name 'librandgrandpip' which may be a typosquatting attempt. The overall pattern matches known malicious behaviors such as stealth execution, obfuscation, and potential remote code execution during package installation or import. Therefore, this code is malicious."
