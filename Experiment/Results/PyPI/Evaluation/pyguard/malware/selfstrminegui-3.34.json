      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests stealth and evasion. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads, often used in malware for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further malicious payloads. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) and the package name 'selfstrminegui' with a comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports malicious intent. The setup call appears to be a cover or a decoy to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. The code runs this hidden PowerShell command automatically during execution without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware installation scripts."
