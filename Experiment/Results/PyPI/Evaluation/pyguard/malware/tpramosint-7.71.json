      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in a hidden window (creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a typical evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands strongly suggest that the code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful payloads during package setup or installation. This behavior aligns with known supply chain attack patterns where malicious code is executed during package installation, enabling stealthy code execution, persistence, or further payload delivery. The rest of the code (the setup call) appears benign, but the subprocess invocation with obfuscated PowerShell commands is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
