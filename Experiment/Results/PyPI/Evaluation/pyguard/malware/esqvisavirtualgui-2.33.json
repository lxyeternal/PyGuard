      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed immediately upon import, combined with the check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution), is a classic stealth technique used by malware. The comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) further suggests malicious intent. The setup() call appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except that suppresses errors, which is a common evasion technique. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during package setup or import is a hallmark of malware, likely for persistence, payload delivery, or further exploitation."
