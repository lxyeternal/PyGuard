      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It contains large base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and executed dynamically using exec, which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique. The code differentiates behavior based on the operating system and executes different base64-decoded payloads accordingly. It performs operations such as creating files in system or user directories, downloading and executing remote code, and exfiltrating sensitive information. The presence of obfuscated strings, dynamic execution during package installation (setup), and network communication to suspicious or hardcoded endpoints (e.g., IP addresses, non-standard domains) further confirm its malicious intent. Additionally, the code uses threading and subprocesses to run hidden or background tasks without user interaction or consent. These behaviors align with known patterns of supply chain attacks, remote code execution, data exfiltration, and persistence mechanisms commonly found in malware. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
