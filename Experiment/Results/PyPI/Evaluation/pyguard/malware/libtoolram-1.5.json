      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence mechanism. Additionally, the author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') along with the commented URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' are suspicious and may be linked to malicious actors. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a known technique for stealthy code execution, potentially for downloading or executing further payloads, privilege escalation, or persistence. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the malicious payload is triggered automatically during import or execution, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious packages. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
