      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'new_install' that registers a function '_post_install' to be executed at exit during the package installation process. The '_post_install' function performs several suspicious actions without user consent or notification: it creates/appends a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with a specific string, collects the public IP address of the host by querying 'https://api.ipify.org', retrieves the hostname via 'os.uname()[1]', and obtains the absolute path of the current script directory. It then encodes this collected information (IP, hostname, path) into a base64 string and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL constructed as 'https://kotko.org?mozilla-iam/mozilla-iam-utilitiescis_publishers=<base64_encoded_data>'. This behavior constitutes silent collection and exfiltration of system information during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious code. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the exfiltrated data, the automatic execution during install time without user interaction, and the contact with an external, non-standard domain strongly indicate malicious intent."
