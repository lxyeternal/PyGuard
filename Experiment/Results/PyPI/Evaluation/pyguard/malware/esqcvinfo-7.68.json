      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, further indicating stealthy behavior. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands strongly suggest malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The setup call itself appears benign, but the hidden PowerShell execution triggered at import or install time is a critical risk indicator of malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthy execution of potentially harmful PowerShell commands during package setup or installation."
