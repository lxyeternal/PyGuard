      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an -EncodedCommand argument. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell command string, which is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flags further indicates stealth execution without user notification. This pattern—executing an obfuscated PowerShell command in hidden mode during package setup—is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, commonly seen in supply chain attacks or malware that executes payloads during installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears legitimate but is used here as a cover to execute the hidden PowerShell payload. There is no user interaction or consent, and the obfuscated command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further malicious code. Therefore, this code is malicious."
