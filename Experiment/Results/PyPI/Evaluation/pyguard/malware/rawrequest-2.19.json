      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (https://esquelesquad.000webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquada.exe) and attempts to invoke a web request, likely to download or execute a payload from this external, non-standard domain. This behavior is consistent with malware that downloads and executes remote payloads covertly during package installation or execution. The presence of this code in a setup script further indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation without user consent. All these factors—obfuscated PowerShell command execution, hidden process spawning, external suspicious URL invocation, and execution during setup—are strong indicators of malicious behavior."
