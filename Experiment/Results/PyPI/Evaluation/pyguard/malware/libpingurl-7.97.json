      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a hidden PowerShell window executing a base64-encoded command. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of subprocess to spawn PowerShell with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests an evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious comment with a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raises suspicion. The rest of the code is a typical setup call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is triggered during import or execution of this script, which is a common supply chain attack vector. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and lack of user consent or legitimate business logic confirms that this code exhibits malicious behavior."
