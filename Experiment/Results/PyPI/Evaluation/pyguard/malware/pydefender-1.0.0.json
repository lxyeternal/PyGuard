      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using hexadecimal escape sequences and base64 encoding, which is a common technique to hide malicious intent. It dynamically imports modules and functions using eval and compile, then decodes and decompresses large base64-encoded payloads that are immediately executed. The code includes multiple layers of decoding and uses eval/exec on the decoded data, which is a strong indicator of arbitrary code execution. The obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns match known malware behaviors such as payload delivery, evasion, and remote code execution. The code also appears to collect environment or system information and likely exfiltrates it or uses it to adapt its behavior. The absence of any user interaction, the use of hidden execution contexts, and the presence of encoded data that is executed at runtime are all hallmarks of malicious code. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

The code also appears to collect environment or system information and likely exfiltrates it or uses it to adapt its behavior. The absence of any legitimate user interaction, the use of hidden or encoded shell commands, and the execution of decoded payloads during runtime or installation strongly indicate malicious activity. Therefore, this code is malicious and likely part of a malware or supply chain attack designed to execute unauthorized code on the host system."
