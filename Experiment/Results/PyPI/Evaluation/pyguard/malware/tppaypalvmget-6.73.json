      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and CREATE_NO_WINDOW creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (\"https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0\") and downloads or executes a file named \"WindowsCache.exe\" in the background without user interaction or notification. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The package name 'tppaypalvmget' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and likely typosquatted or attacker-controlled. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command, the hidden execution, and the download of an executable from a non-standard URL are all classic hallmarks of malware, specifically a supply chain or installation-time attack. The setup() call is wrapped in a try/except block, likely to suppress errors and avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated payload during package installation, which is a high-risk malicious behavior."
