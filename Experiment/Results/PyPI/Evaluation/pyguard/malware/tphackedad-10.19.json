      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known method for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads, often used in malware for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further malicious code. Additionally, the package name 'tphackedad' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email address 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest suspicious or attacker-controlled metadata. The code runs this hidden PowerShell command automatically during the setup process without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious Python packages. The presence of a suspicious comment with a non-standard domain 'www.esquelesquad.rip' further supports malicious intent. Overall, the combination of obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, suspicious package metadata, and lack of legitimate user interaction confirms that this code is malicious."
