      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates stealthy execution without user notification. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the package name 'esqadpostmine' authored by 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggests an attempt to disguise malicious activity as a legitimate package. The setup() call appears benign but is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, which is a common evasion technique. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, conditional execution based on directory existence, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with malware that executes hidden payloads during package installation or execution."
