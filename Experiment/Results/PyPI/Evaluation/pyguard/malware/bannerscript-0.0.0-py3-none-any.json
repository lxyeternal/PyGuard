      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file (jjz.exe) from a hardcoded, external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction or consent. It creates a new directory named 'data' in the current working directory, changes into it, writes the downloaded content as 'jjz.exe', executes this executable immediately using os.system, and then deletes the executable file. This sequence of downloading a binary from an untrusted remote source and executing it directly is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the host system. There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification before execution, and the executable is removed immediately after running, which is typical for malware attempting to evade detection. The use of a hardcoded external URL to fetch an executable and the immediate execution without any safeguards strongly indicates malicious intent."
