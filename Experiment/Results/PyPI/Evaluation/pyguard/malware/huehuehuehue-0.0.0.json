      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses setuptools.setup with an exec call that decodes and executes a base64-encoded payload at install time. The decoded payload creates a socket connection to a hardcoded private IP address (192.168.252.178) on port 9001, attempts to receive data, decompresses it using zlib, decodes it from base64, and executes it dynamically. This pattern of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network communication during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The code effectively acts as a backdoor or remote code execution vector triggered during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack technique. There is no user interaction or legitimate business logic, and the use of base64 and zlib decoding to hide the payload further confirms malicious intent."
