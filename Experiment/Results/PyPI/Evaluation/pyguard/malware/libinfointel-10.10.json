      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it only runs if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a stealthy check to avoid repeated execution or detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a package name and author email that appear suspicious further support malicious intent. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of arbitrary code during package installation. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated, potentially harmful commands on the host system, consistent with malicious behavior."
