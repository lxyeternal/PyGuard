      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed immediately upon import, combined with the check for a directory named 'tahg' (likely used as a marker to avoid repeated execution), is a classic stealth technique used by malware. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggest suspicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup script for a package, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious payload delivery during package installation. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a critical risk indicator of malicious activity."
