      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the PowerShell window, a common stealth technique used by malware. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking a web request to a suspicious domain (noted in the comment as www.esquelesquad.rip) or executing further payloads. This execution happens automatically during the import or setup phase without any user interaction or notification, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malware embedded in Python packages. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with hidden process execution and the suspicious domain reference strongly indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution makes the entire script malicious."
