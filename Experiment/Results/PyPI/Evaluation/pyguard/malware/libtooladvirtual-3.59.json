      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The command is obfuscated via base64 encoding, which is a common evasion technique. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a typical evasion or persistence check. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The use of subprocess to execute obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and potential payload delivery. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute a hidden PowerShell payload during installation, which is a hallmark of malware."
