      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It conditionally executes code based on command-line arguments and platform checks. The code imports modules like pip and win32com, dynamically constructs strings, and performs file system operations in user environment directories. It creates and writes files in user-specific paths, uses COM objects to create shortcuts, and checks for administrative privileges. The obfuscation and behavior strongly resemble malware techniques such as persistence, privilege escalation, and payload deployment. The code runs during package setup, which is a known supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code on installation. The absence of legitimate user interaction, the use of obfuscation, environment variable access, file writing in sensitive locations, and dynamic execution patterns are all strong indicators of malicious intent."
