      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during package installation are typical characteristics of supply chain attacks and malware. The package name 'tensofla' appears to be a typo-squatted variant of 'tensorflow', which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The code also specifies Windows as the target OS, which aligns with the conditional execution of the malicious payload. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators including code obfuscation, execution of decrypted code during installation, and use of external modules to facilitate malicious actions, confirming it is malicious."
