      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed in hidden mode is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during installation. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during package setup, all of which are hallmarks of malware."
