      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell command). This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as indicated by the decoded command fragment referencing a URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and outputting to a Windows cache executable. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the true intent, execution during package setup, and the suspicious author and URL references (e.g., 'EsqueleSquad', 'tahgoficial@proton.me', and 'www.esquelesquad.rip') further confirm malicious intent. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector where malicious code is executed during package installation to download and run a hidden payload, which is a hallmark of malware."
