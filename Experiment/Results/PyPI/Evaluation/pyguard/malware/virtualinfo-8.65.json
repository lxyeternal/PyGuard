      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and uses the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The Base64-encoded PowerShell command likely contains obfuscated instructions that could perform unauthorized or harmful actions. This execution happens automatically during the import or setup phase without any user interaction or consent. Such behavior—executing obfuscated PowerShell commands silently during package setup—is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly observed in malware for stealthy code execution, persistence, or payload delivery. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution embedded in the setup script is a hallmark of a supply chain attack or malicious package installation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
