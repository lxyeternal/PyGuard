      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating a stealth or persistence mechanism. This behavior is highly indicative of malicious intent, as it uses obfuscation, hidden execution, and process spawning to run potentially harmful commands silently. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code contains malicious behavior."
