      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification and is triggered automatically if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. This behavior is indicative of stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name 'esqadcvmc' with an author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raise suspicion. The code attempts to execute hidden PowerShell commands during the setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks and remote code execution. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent."
