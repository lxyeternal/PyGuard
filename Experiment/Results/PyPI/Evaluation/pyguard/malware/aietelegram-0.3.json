      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is highly obfuscated and contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed via exec during the package installation process (when 'sdist' is not in argv and the OS is Windows). This behavior is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation without user consent. The decoded payload includes numerous suspicious operations such as environment discovery, file system manipulation, execution of shell commands, and network communication to external, potentially attacker-controlled servers. The code also imports modules and uses techniques commonly associated with malware, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and stealthy background activity. These characteristics align with known malicious patterns such as credential theft, data exfiltration, and remote code execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
