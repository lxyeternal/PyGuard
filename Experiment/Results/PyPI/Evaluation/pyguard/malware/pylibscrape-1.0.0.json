      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It collects extensive sensitive user data including system information (username, computer name, Windows key, hardware ID, IP address, geolocation), browser data (passwords, cookies, history, credit card info), Discord tokens, Minecraft and Roblox data, and cryptocurrency wallet addresses. It uses obfuscated and encoded data, decrypts browser-stored secrets using Windows APIs, and exfiltrates all collected data to attacker-controlled endpoints (notably https://kekwltd.ru/relay and hardcoded Discord webhooks). The code also attempts to evade detection by killing Discord-related processes, bypassing protections, and checking for virtual machine or analysis environments. It replaces clipboard cryptocurrency addresses with attacker-controlled addresses to hijack transactions. The code runs automatically on Windows startup, installs numerous Python packages silently, and uses threading to run background stealing and exfiltration tasks. It creates temporary files and archives stolen data before uploading. The presence of hardcoded attacker URLs, extensive credential theft, clipboard hijacking, anti-debugging, and stealthy persistence mechanisms confirm this is malicious malware designed for credential theft, data exfiltration, and cryptocurrency theft."
