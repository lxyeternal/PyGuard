      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally on the absence of a directory named 'tahg' indicates stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as invoking web requests or downloading/executing further payloads, as suggested by the suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscation. This pattern of obfuscated command execution via PowerShell in a setup script is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware installation during package setup. The rest of the setup code appears normal but is overshadowed by the covert execution of the encoded PowerShell command."
