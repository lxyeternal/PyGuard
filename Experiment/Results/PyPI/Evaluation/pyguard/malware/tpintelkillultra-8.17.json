      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command, the use of subprocess to execute it silently, and the check for a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution) are classic hallmarks of malware attempting stealthy execution. Additionally, the author and email fields (EsqueleSquad, tahgoficial@proton.me) and the suspicious comment with a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) further suggest malicious intent. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover for a legitimate package installation, but the hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell command during import or setup is a known supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code is malicious."
