      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the stack trace, environment variable keys, system uname details, and the public IP address of the host by querying 'https://ipinfo.io/ip'. It then encodes a hardcoded base64 string to obtain a URL (https://hooks.slack.com/services/...), which is a Slack webhook URL, and sends this collected information as a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to that external endpoint without any user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the webhook URL, automatic execution of this data collection and exfiltration upon import or execution, and immediate program termination (exit(1)) strongly indicate malicious intent. The code also attempts to evade analysis by skipping execution if run on known bot hostnames or known analysis scripts. This pattern of environment reconnaissance combined with silent data exfiltration to a hardcoded, obfuscated external server is a classic hallmark of malware, specifically information-stealing or reconnaissance malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the code operates stealthily, making it malicious."
