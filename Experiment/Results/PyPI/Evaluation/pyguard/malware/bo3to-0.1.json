      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class 'gpl' that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, it performs obfuscated operations: it contains an obfuscated string 'l' which is decoded by a ROT13-like cipher to produce 'h'. It then reads the file '/etc/passwd' (variable 'f'), parses its lines, and for any line where the third colon-separated field equals '1000' (a typical user ID for a normal user), it extracts the username 'u'. It then attempts to open the file '/home/{username}/.profile' and appends the decoded string 'h' to it. This behavior effectively injects code or commands into the user's shell profile without consent. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern where malicious code executes during package installation to persistently modify user environment files, potentially leading to remote code execution or further compromise. The obfuscation, the targeting of sensitive system files, and the silent failure suppression (empty except block) further indicate malicious intent. Such behavior is not legitimate for a package installation and is a strong indicator of malware."
