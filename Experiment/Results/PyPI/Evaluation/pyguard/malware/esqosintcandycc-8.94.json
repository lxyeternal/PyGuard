      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a known obfuscation technique used to hide malicious intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated detection. The PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and downloads or executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden window, which strongly suggests downloading and executing a malicious payload stealthily. The presence of this behavior in a setup script (distutils.core.setup) further indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent or interaction. The package name 'esqosintcandycc' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and likely fake. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process creation, suspicious external URL, and execution during package setup is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with malware delivery and execution."
