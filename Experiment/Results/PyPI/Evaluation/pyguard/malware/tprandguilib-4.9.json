      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests stealth and evasion. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially harmful commands. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name, which may be typosquatting or misleading. The code executes this payload automatically during setup without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is malicious."
