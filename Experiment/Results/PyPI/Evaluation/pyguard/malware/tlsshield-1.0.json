It then immediately executes this script in a new Python interpreter process. This dynamic retrieval and execution of remote code during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of temporary files to hide the payload, the lack of any legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the execution of arbitrary remote code during installation are all hallmarks of malware. This behavior enables remote code execution on the victim's machine, potentially leading to further compromise, data theft, or system control. Therefore, this code is malicious."

It then executes this temporary file using a Python interpreter subprocess. This pattern of dynamically fetching and executing remote code at runtime is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source. The absence of any user interaction, validation, or legitimate business logic, combined with the direct execution of downloaded code, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and evasion techniques. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
