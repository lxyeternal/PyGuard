      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window hidden and uses obfuscation to avoid detection. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The author and email fields, as well as the commented URL (www.esquelesquad.rip), suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The use of try/except blocks to silently ignore errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection or analysis. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window, conditional execution based on file system state, and embedding in a package setup script strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with malware or a supply chain attack."
