      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded Fernet key. This pattern of decrypting and immediately executing code during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent. The package name 'web3.pyy' appears suspicious and possibly typosquatted. The use of obfuscated class names and encrypted payloads further supports the intent to evade detection. Executing arbitrary decrypted code during installation, especially without user interaction or transparency, is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
