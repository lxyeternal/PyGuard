      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded command is executed without user interaction or notification, and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide its execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during the setup script execution is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading and executing further payloads. Additionally, the package metadata contains suspicious author information and a suspicious URL comment (www.esquelesquad.rip), which further supports the malicious intent. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious Python code, especially supply chain attacks and stealthy payload execution during package installation."
