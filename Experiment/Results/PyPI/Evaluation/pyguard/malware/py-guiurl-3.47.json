      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated PowerShell command and the suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip). This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware that execute code during installation to compromise the system stealthily. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is used here as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
