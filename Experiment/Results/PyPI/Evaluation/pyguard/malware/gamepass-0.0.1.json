      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware. It performs extensive environment reconnaissance and anti-debugging checks to detect virtual machines, debuggers, and blacklisted IPs, terminating execution if detected. The code stealthily collects sensitive user data including Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords (by decrypting Chrome's encrypted data), and files from user directories with keywords related to accounts, passwords, wallets, and backups. It then exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL and uploads files to external file hosting services, sending detailed user and system information without user consent. The code also injects malicious JavaScript into Discord client files to maintain persistence and further data capture. It copies itself to the Windows startup folder to achieve persistence. The use of obfuscated variable names, base64 decoding, threading for stealth, and network communication to attacker-controlled endpoints further confirms its malicious intent. These behaviors align with known patterns of information-stealing malware designed to harvest credentials and sensitive data from victims and exfiltrate it covertly."
