      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to avoid repeated execution or detection. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, further indicating stealth behavior. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands strongly suggest malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
