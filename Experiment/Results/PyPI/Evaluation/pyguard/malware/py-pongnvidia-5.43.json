      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands, and the subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, indicating stealth execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and may be linked to malicious actors. The setup call appears benign superficially but is wrapped in a try/except pass block, which suppresses errors and may be used to hide malicious activity during package installation. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during installation. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell command execution in hidden mode, execution during package setup, suppression of errors, and suspicious author/contact information. Therefore, this code is malicious."
