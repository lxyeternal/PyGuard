      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden) and uses the 'Invoke-WebRequest' cmdlet to download or interact with a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and outputs it to a file named '~\\WindowsCache.exe'. Then it executes this downloaded file. This behavior is consistent with downloading and executing a malicious payload silently on the victim's machine. The presence of the suspicious URL, obfuscated PowerShell command, hidden execution, and automatic payload download and execution without user consent or notification are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the package metadata references 'EsqueleSquad' and an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which may be linked to threat actors or malicious packages. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealthy payload download, and execution during package setup."
