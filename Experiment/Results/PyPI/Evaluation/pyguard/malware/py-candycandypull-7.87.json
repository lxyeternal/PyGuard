      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed during the setup script, combined with the check for a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution), is a classic supply chain attack pattern. This technique is commonly used to execute arbitrary or harmful code stealthily during package installation. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or data exfiltration. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
