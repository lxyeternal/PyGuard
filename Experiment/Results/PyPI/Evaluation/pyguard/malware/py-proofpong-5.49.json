      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealth execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking a web request to a suspicious URL (notably 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm...'), which is a common technique for downloading or executing further malicious payloads. The presence of a directory existence check ('tahg') before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious code during package installation without user consent or interaction. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') along with the suspicious URL and obfuscated command further support the malicious intent. The try-except blocks suppress errors, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute a hidden PowerShell payload during package setup, a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks."
