      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hijacks the setuptools install process to execute malicious actions during package installation. It attempts to escalate privileges by re-launching itself with administrator rights on Windows. Then, it silently downloads a file named 'image.png' from a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (http://wpp-api-01hw.onrender.com/api/images/1140884481671188581/image.png) using the requests library, without any user consent or notification. The downloaded file is then read, base64-decoded, and executed directly via exec(), enabling arbitrary remote code execution. This pattern of downloading obfuscated code from an attacker-controlled server and executing it during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector. The code also suppresses errors and delays execution, likely to evade detection. The package name and author information appear suspicious and do not correspond to known legitimate software. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including privilege escalation, remote code retrieval and execution, obfuscation via base64, and execution during installation without user interaction."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code fetches JSON data from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://wpp-api-vrv3.onrender.com/api/steal/1140884481671188581/) without any user interaction or validation. It extracts a 'code' field from the JSON response and immediately executes it using exec(). This pattern of retrieving code from an untrusted remote source and executing it dynamically is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It enables remote code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's system. The absence of any integrity checks, user consent, or sandboxing further confirms the high risk. Such behavior is commonly observed in malware, including remote access trojans, backdoors, or loaders that fetch and run payloads from command-and-control servers."
