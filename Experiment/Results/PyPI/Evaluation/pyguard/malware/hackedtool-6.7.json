      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known method for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads, often used in malware for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further malicious code. This execution happens automatically during the import or setup phase without user interaction or consent, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. The rest of the code is a setup call for a package named 'hackedtool' with suspicious author information and no legitimate business logic. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden window, and automatic execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
