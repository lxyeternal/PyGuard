      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command. During installation, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration without user consent or notification. The use of a custom install hook to perform network communication during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector. The external domain is attacker-controlled infrastructure commonly used for interaction and monitoring in penetration testing and malicious activity. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with credential or environment data theft during package installation."
