      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior. It creates a temporary file and writes Python code into it that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://pub-419bfb1465754687a6ed3a1145bf7202.r2.dev/lSnPxksiKyOTXyT1) using urllib.request. This downloaded code is executed immediately via exec, which is a strong indicator of remote code execution from an untrusted source. Furthermore, on Windows systems, it attempts to spawn a new process to run the Python executable with the temporary file as an argument, effectively executing the downloaded payload in a separate process without user interaction or consent. This pattern of dynamically fetching and executing remote code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The obfuscated variable names, lack of any legitimate user interaction, and the execution of arbitrary remote code during setup confirm the malicious intent."
