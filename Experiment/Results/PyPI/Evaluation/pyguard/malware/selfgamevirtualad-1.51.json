      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated (Base64-encoded UTF-16LE) and executed without user interaction or notification. The command references a suspicious GitHub URL (github.com/T4Hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe), indicating it likely downloads and executes a remote payload. The directory existence check for 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or conditional payload execution. This behavior is typical of malware performing remote code execution and payload delivery during package installation or execution. The use of try/except to silently ignore errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, remote payload retrieval, stealth execution, and execution triggered during package setup."
