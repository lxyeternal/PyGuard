      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background stealthily. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (\"https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0\") and attempts to invoke a web request or download, which is a typical behavior of malware that downloads and executes a payload from a remote server. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag further indicates an attempt to hide the execution window from the user. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a non-standard package name, which may be used to disguise malicious code as a legitimate package. Taken together, these factors strongly indicate that the code is malicious, designed to stealthily download and execute a remote payload during package installation or execution."
