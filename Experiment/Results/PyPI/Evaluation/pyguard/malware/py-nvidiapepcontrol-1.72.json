      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a typical evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name 'py-nvidiapepcontrol' with an author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raise suspicion. The code runs this hidden PowerShell command during the setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, enabling execution of malicious payloads during package installation. The combination of obfuscated command execution, stealthy process spawning, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
