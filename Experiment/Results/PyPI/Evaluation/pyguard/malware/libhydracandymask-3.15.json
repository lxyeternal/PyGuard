      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that executes a PowerShell command with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window, indicating stealthy behavior. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a typical evasion or persistence technique. The presence of a suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands strongly indicate malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious code during package installation. These factors combined match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated code execution, stealth process spawning, and potential remote code execution or payload delivery."
