      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It hooks into the setuptools installation process to execute code automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. The 'send' function collects the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' (system identifier) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', which is a classic data exfiltration pattern. Furthermore, if the platform is Windows ('win32'), it downloads an executable file from another suspicious URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', saves it locally as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and immediately executes it using 'os.system' with the 'start' command. This sequence of downloading and executing a remote binary without validation or user consent is a hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. The use of try/except to silently suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The package name 'django-metamaks-auth' and versioning appear crafted to mimic legitimate packages, which is a common supply chain attack technique. Overall, the code performs environment reconnaissance, data exfiltration, and downloads and executes untrusted code during installation, all of which are critical risk indicators of malicious intent."
