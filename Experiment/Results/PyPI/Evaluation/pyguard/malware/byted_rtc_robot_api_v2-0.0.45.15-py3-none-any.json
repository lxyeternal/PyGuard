      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system environment information (OS name and release, current working directory, and hostname) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, attacker-controlled domain constructed dynamically using the local hostname concatenated with a non-standard domain (zkecscnceogkcofvfnoqhyc1gg3hf6aqe.22.ax). This behavior matches known malicious patterns of silent environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded, obscure domain and automatic network communication to an external server strongly indicates malicious intent, as it is a hallmark of information-stealing or staging malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the data sent could be used for fingerprinting or further exploitation."
