      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed in hidden mode is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, often used for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The setup() call with suspicious package name 'py-nvidiarandvirtual' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests a malicious package masquerading as a legitimate library. The overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, hidden execution, and potential supply chain attack via package installation."
