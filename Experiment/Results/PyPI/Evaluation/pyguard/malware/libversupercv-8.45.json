      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known pattern for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) and a suspicious package name 'libversupercv' with a comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' (a non-standard domain) further supports malicious intent. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate Python package. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid crashing or revealing its presence. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy subprocess creation, suspicious metadata, and lack of legitimate user interaction or notification strongly indicates malicious behavior."
