      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command class that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The package name 'web3.0py' and obfuscated class and variable names further suggest evasion and concealment. The decrypted code is not visible in the source, indicating dynamic payload delivery and execution, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of 'exec' on decrypted data during installation, combined with network-related imports, strongly indicates remote code execution and potential further malicious activity. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with malware that hijacks the installation process to execute hidden payloads."
