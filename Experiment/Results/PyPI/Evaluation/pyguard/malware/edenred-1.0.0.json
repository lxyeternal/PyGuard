      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install process and, upon installation, collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (cdf5rwk2vtc0000c78d0ggz1hqeyyyyyb.oast.fun), which is attacker-controlled infrastructure. This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and user data without user consent or legitimate purpose. The use of a custom install hook to execute network communication during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The hardcoded, non-standard domain and the nature of the data exfiltrated strongly indicate malicious intent."
