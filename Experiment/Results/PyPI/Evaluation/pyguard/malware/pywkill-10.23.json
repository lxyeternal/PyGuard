      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for evasion and to execute arbitrary or malicious payloads without user awareness. The base64-encoded command likely contains a PowerShell script that performs unauthorized or harmful actions, although the exact decoded content is not shown here. Additionally, this execution happens automatically during the setup script execution, which is a classic supply chain attack vector where malicious code runs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution alongside it strongly indicates malicious intent. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
