      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command. This pattern of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with hidden execution of PowerShell is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code to run automatically during package installation without user consent or interaction. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
