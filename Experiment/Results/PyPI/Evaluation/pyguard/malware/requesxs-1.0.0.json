      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary decrypted code during package installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a base64-encoded payload, which is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The package name 'requesxs' is suspiciously similar to 'requests', indicating possible typosquatting. The decrypted payload is not visible in the source, but the use of Fernet decryption followed by exec strongly suggests execution of hidden malicious code. The installation hook runs automatically during package installation, enabling remote code execution and potential further malicious actions. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as code obfuscation, dynamic code execution during install, and lack of user consent or transparency."
