      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before executing the command, the use of a hidden PowerShell window, and the encoded command strongly indicate malicious intent. Additionally, the setup() call uses a suspicious package name ('selfpipstudyhacked') and author information ('EsqueleSquad'), which is often a tactic used in supply chain attacks to execute malicious code during package installation. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, and suspicious package metadata is a hallmark of malware designed to execute unauthorized code on the victim's system."
