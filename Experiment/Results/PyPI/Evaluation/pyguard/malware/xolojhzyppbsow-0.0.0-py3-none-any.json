      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code imports base64 and immediately executes a large base64-decoded payload using exec. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide malicious code. The decoded payload is not visible directly, but the use of exec on base64-decoded data is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such patterns are almost exclusively observed in malware samples and are used to conceal the true nature of the code, evade detection, and execute arbitrary or harmful actions. The code lacks any user interaction or legitimate business logic and performs dynamic code execution from obfuscated data, which is a hallmark of malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
