      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions that decode strings dynamically. It performs conditional checks on command-line arguments and platform, then executes loops with complex state changes. The code imports modules like pip and win32com.client.Dispatch dynamically, attempts to create and write files in user directories (e.g., using environment variables like APPDATA), and creates Windows shortcuts. It also checks for administrative privileges and performs file system operations such as walking directories and writing files with obfuscated names. The obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns, combined with environment discovery, file creation in user/system directories, and use of Windows COM interfaces to create shortcuts, strongly indicate malicious intent. These behaviors align with known malware tactics such as persistence mechanisms, payload deployment, and evasion. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, executing malicious payloads during package installation without user consent. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
