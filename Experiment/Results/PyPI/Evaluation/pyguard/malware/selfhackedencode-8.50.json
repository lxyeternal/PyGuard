      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window hidden and uses obfuscation to avoid detection. Additionally, the author and email fields in the setup call reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which are suspicious and not associated with legitimate packages. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution during the setup phase (package installation) is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling remote code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The code suppresses errors silently with try/except pass blocks, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for such obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution in a setup script, and the behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during package installation."
