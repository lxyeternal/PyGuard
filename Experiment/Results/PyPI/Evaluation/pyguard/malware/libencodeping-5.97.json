      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed during the setup script execution is a classic supply chain attack technique, enabling stealthy execution of potentially harmful code during package installation. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The author and email fields reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which along with the obfuscated PowerShell command and the suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) further suggest malicious intent. This pattern of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during package setup is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks."
