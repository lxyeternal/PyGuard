      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of obfuscated (Base64-encoded) PowerShell commands executed silently is a classic technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of such obfuscation and hidden execution in a setup script context (during package installation) is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The author and email fields, as well as the commented URL (www.esquelesquad.rip), further suggest suspicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands on the victim's machine during package installation, which is a critical risk and confirms malicious intent."
