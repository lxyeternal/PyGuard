      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, a typical stealth technique. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call from distutils.core, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell execution during the setup phase strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during package installation. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators: use of subprocess.Popen to spawn PowerShell with encoded commands, stealth execution (hidden window), obfuscation via base64 encoding, conditional execution based on file system state, and execution during package setup/install. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a setup script, and no user interaction or notification is present. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
