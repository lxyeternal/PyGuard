      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during the package setup phase is a hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the author and email fields reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which are suspicious and may be linked to malicious actors. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely used as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this pattern matches known malicious supply chain attacks where code execution is triggered during package installation, leveraging obfuscation and hidden execution to evade detection."
