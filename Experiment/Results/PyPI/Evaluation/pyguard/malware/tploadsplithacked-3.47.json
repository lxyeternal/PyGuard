      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip and the encoded command referencing a suspicious domain). This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a setup script is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The use of try/except to silently suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The package metadata and naming ('tploadsplithacked', author 'EsqueleSquad') also suggest a malicious or compromised package. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during package installation, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
