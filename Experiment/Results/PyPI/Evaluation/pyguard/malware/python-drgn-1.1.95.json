      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command, causing it to execute automatically during package installation. During this execution, it collects extensive system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration (ifconfig or ipconfig), public IP address (via HTTP GET to http://ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive environment and user information to a hardcoded external Slack webhook URL via an HTTP POST request without any user consent or notification. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration of sensitive system and user identity information during package installation, a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration, combined with the execution of this code during install time (not user-invoked runtime), and the absence of any legitimate business logic or user interaction, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches known critical risk indicators for malware, specifically supply chain attacks that harvest and exfiltrate environment and user data stealthily during package installation."
