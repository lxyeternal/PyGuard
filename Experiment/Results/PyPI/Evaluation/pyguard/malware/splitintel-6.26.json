      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The Base64-encoded PowerShell command likely contains obfuscated instructions that could perform unauthorized or harmful actions. This execution happens automatically during the import or setup phase without any user interaction or notification, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before launching the hidden process suggests an evasion or persistence mechanism. The rest of the code is a typical setup call, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands is a strong indicator of malware, consistent with supply chain attacks or payload delivery during package installation."
