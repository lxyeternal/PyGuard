      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and dynamically executed code at the end. Specifically, it defines two obfuscated strings: 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' and 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp', then uses a loop to XOR-decode one string with the other, producing a decoded string 'oIoeaTEAcvpae'. This decoded string is then executed using eval(compile(...)). This pattern of obfuscation combined with dynamic execution (eval/compile) is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true payload from static analysis. The rest of the code is a large library for terminal color and animation effects, which appears benign, but the final obfuscated payload execution is suspicious. The obfuscated payload likely contains code that performs unauthorized or harmful actions, which is a common malware technique. The use of eval on dynamically decoded data without any validation or user consent is a critical risk and hallmark of malicious behavior."
