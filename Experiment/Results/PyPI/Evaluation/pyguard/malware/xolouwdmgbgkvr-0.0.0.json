      "malicious_behavior": "The code is malicious because it programmatically extracts sensitive authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers using the 'browser_cookie3' library without user consent. It then validates the cookie and, if valid, collects extensive user account information (including user ID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, premium status, and IP address). This sensitive data, including the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie itself, is exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is attacker-controlled. The code operates without any user interaction or notification, effectively acting as a credential stealer and data exfiltration tool targeting Roblox accounts. Such behavior aligns with known malicious patterns of automated credential theft and unauthorized data transmission to external servers."
