      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This technique is a well-known method for stealthy execution of potentially harmful commands without user interaction or notification. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code attempts to run a standard setup() call from distutils.core, but this is wrapped in a try/except pass block, likely to mask the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands, hidden execution, and conditional checks aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including supply chain attacks, stealth execution, and remote code execution. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
