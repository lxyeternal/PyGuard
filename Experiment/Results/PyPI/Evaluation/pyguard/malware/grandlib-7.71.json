      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates stealth execution without user notification. This behavior is strongly associated with malicious activity, such as executing hidden payloads, persistence, or downloading/executing further malicious code. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during the import or setup phase is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
