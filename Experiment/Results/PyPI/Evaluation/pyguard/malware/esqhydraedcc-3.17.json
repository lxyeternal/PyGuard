      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed immediately upon import, combined with the check for a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution), is a classic stealth technique used by malware. The encoded command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) as indicated in the comment, which is not a known legitimate source. This pattern of obfuscated command execution during package setup or import is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script but contains this hidden malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
