      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that executes automatically during package installation. In the overridden 'run' method of the CustomInstallCommand class, it imports network and Discord-related modules, retrieves the local machine's hostname and IP address, and asynchronously sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes automated data exfiltration of system information during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL to silently transmit host identifiers during install time, without any legitimate business logic or user notification, strongly indicates malicious intent."
