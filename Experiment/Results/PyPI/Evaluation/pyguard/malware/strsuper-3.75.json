      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command. This pattern of obfuscation (Base64 encoding) combined with spawning a hidden PowerShell process is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy execution of malicious payloads, privilege escalation, or downloading and running further malicious code. Additionally, this execution happens automatically during the setup process without any user interaction or notification, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious PyPI packages. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely used as a cover to disguise the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
