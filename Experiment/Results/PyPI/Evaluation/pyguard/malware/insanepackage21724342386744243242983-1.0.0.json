      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that overrides the standard install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec on the output of Fernet decryption. The Fernet key and the encrypted payload are hardcoded and obfuscated, indicating an attempt to hide the true payload. Executing decrypted code at install time without user interaction or consent is a classic supply chain attack technique. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The package name is suspiciously random and the description and long description are nonsensical, further supporting the likelihood of maliciousness. The use of exec on decrypted data, combined with network-related imports and execution during install, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote code execution, obfuscation, and supply chain attack patterns."
