      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it executes this hidden PowerShell command without any user interaction or notification. This pattern of spawning a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, this execution happens during the import/setup phase, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution alongside it strongly indicates malicious intent."
