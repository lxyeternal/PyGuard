      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary decrypted code during package installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key and immediately executes it with exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The obfuscated DESCRIPTION and LONG_DESCRIPTION strings further suggest intent to hide true functionality. The use of exec on decrypted data during installation, combined with network-related imports, strongly indicates that the package performs unauthorized remote code execution and possibly data exfiltration or further payload delivery. Such behavior is not legitimate for typical Python packages and is a critical risk indicator of malware."
