      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This technique is a well-known method for stealthy execution of potentially harmful commands or payloads without user interaction or notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs network communication or downloads/executions from a suspicious domain (noted in the comment: www.esquelesquad.rip), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent such as payload delivery, persistence, or data exfiltration. Additionally, the setup() call with the suspicious package name 'selfccmcpush' and author 'EsqueleSquad' combined with the hidden PowerShell execution during package installation strongly suggests a supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) and hidden process execution without user consent or legitimate purpose confirms the code is malicious."
