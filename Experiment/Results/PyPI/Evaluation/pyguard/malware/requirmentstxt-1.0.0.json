      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Inside this method, it checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using exec(). The decryption key and encrypted payload are hardcoded and obfuscated using Fernet symmetric encryption. This decrypted code is executed immediately during the package installation process without user interaction or consent. Executing dynamically decrypted code at install time is a classic supply chain attack technique enabling remote code execution. The package name 'requirmentstxt' is suspiciously similar to 'requirements.txt', indicating possible typosquatting. The obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and execution during install strongly indicate malicious intent, likely to deliver and run a hidden payload on Windows systems. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, execution of decrypted payloads during installation, and lack of user notification."
