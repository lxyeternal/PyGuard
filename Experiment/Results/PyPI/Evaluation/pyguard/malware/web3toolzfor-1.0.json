      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded URL that points to a Discord webhook, which is a hardcoded attacker-controlled external endpoint. It then searches for Steam-related files (ssfn* files and config directory) in the Program Files (x86) Steam folder, packages these files into a zip archive in the TEMP directory, and silently sends this archive via an HTTP POST request to the decoded webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes unauthorized collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive user data (Steam session files), which is a hallmark of credential-stealing or information-exfiltration malware. The use of base64 encoding to hide the webhook URL, the silent file creation and deletion, and the immediate network transmission to an external server are strong indicators of malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It decodes a base64-encoded URL string, which is a common obfuscation technique used to hide the true destination. It then checks for the existence of a user-specific directory related to the Exodus wallet, a cryptocurrency wallet application, indicating targeted data collection. The script copies this directory to a temporary location, compresses it into a zip archive, and sends the archive via an HTTP POST request to the decoded remote URL (stored in the variable 'hook', which is presumably assigned the decoded URL but is missing in the snippet). This sequence is a classic pattern of data exfiltration malware, specifically targeting sensitive user data without any user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscation, targeting of sensitive wallet data, automated compression, and network exfiltration to a hardcoded remote endpoint collectively confirm malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports multiple modules with suspicious names such as 'metamask', 'discord', 'exodus', 'machine', 'screenshot', and 'telegram', which are commonly associated with credential or token stealing malware. The function 'stha' attempts to import a module named 'web3toolzfor.passwords_cards_cookies', which suggests automated extraction of sensitive data like passwords, cards, and cookies. It also tries to import 'steam', likely to target Steam credentials. The function calls 'yea()', 'find_tokens()', 'runner()', 'machineinfo()', 'sikrinsat()', and 'telegram()', all wrapped in try-except blocks to suppress errors and continue execution, indicating stealthy behavior. The names and context strongly imply that these functions perform credential/token extraction, machine information gathering, screenshot capture, and data exfiltration via Telegram. The entire 'stha' function is executed in a separate thread immediately upon import/startup, without any user interaction or notification, which is a common evasion technique in malware. The code structure, import patterns, and function names align with known malicious behaviors such as automated credential theft, environment reconnaissance, and covert data exfiltration. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential theft and data exfiltration without user consent. The use of base64 encoding to hide the webhook URL, the targeting of sensitive user data (Discord tokens), and the automated network transmission to an attacker-controlled endpoint are strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with credential-stealing malware."

It then sends this zip file via an HTTP POST request to the decoded webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This pattern of silently collecting sensitive browser extension data and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server is a hallmark of credential-stealing malware. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding of the webhook URL), targeting of sensitive user data (MetaMask extension data), writing to temporary directories, and automated network exfiltration without notification or error handling further confirm malicious intent."

It enumerates installed browsers by checking known browser data directories, then accesses and decrypts sensitive user data such as saved passwords, cookies, credit card information, browsing history, and download history. The decryption uses Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData) and AES-GCM with the browser's master key, indicating deep integration with browser security mechanisms. The collected data is saved into temporary files under the user's AppData Local Temp directory, then compressed into a ZIP archive. This archive is then exfiltrated via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, base64-obfuscated Discord webhook URL (hosted on discord.com), which is a common attacker-controlled endpoint for receiving stolen data. The entire process runs silently without user interaction or notification, and the temporary files are deleted after exfiltration to cover tracks. The use of base64 encoding to hide the webhook URL, the automated collection of highly sensitive credentials, and the network exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server are all hallmark indicators of malicious intent and data theft. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to steal and exfiltrate browser credentials and related sensitive information."

It then encodes this information into a JSON payload and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is base64-encoded and decoded at runtime to obfuscate the destination. This behavior is a classic example of information-stealing malware that silently exfiltrates sensitive host fingerprinting data to an attacker-controlled server. The use of base64 encoding to hide the webhook URL, the automated gathering of hardware identifiers and network information, and the immediate network transmission without user notification or legitimate business logic are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no benign justification for this pattern, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including data exfiltration, obfuscation, and unauthorized system reconnaissance."
