      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation techniques including base64 encoding, base32 decoding, zlib decompression, and marshal deserialization to hide its true functionality. The code imports cryptography's Fernet module and decrypts a large hex-encoded payload, which is then base64 and base32 decoded multiple times, indicating layered obfuscation. Finally, it executes the dynamically decoded and decrypted code using exec on a decompressed marshal object, a classic method for executing hidden or dynamically generated malicious payloads. Such patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are not typical of benign software. The code lacks any user interaction or legitimate business logic, and the obfuscation is designed to evade detection and analysis. This behavior is consistent with credential stealing, remote code execution, or supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation or runtime without user consent. Therefore, this code is conclusively malicious."
