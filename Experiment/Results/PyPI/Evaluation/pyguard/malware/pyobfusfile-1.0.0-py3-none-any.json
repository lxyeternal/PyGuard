      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including base64, zlib decompression, and character code transformations, followed by dynamic execution via eval and exec. It constructs and executes code at runtime from obfuscated data, which is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The code uses eval on dynamically generated strings and decompresses and decodes a base64-encoded payload that is then executed without any validation or user interaction. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution from hidden or encrypted payloads, evading static analysis and detection. The obfuscation and immediate execution of decoded data, combined with the absence of legitimate user interaction or business logic, indicate that the code is designed to conceal its true intent and likely performs unauthorized or harmful actions. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

It constructs and executes code from decoded and decompressed data at runtime, which is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The code uses obfuscated variable names and lambda functions to hide its intent. The presence of eval on dynamically generated code strings, especially after decoding and decompressing, strongly indicates execution of hidden payloads. Such patterns are typical in malware for evading static analysis and delivering malicious payloads. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the code appears designed to execute arbitrary code without consent. These factors collectively confirm that the code contains malicious behavior."
