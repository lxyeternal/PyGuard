      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious credential stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and other sensitive user data. It collects Discord tokens from various local storage paths of browsers and Discord clients, decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI, and gathers user environment information such as IP address and username. The stolen data is then exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is attacker-controlled. The code also attempts to zip and upload files related to wallets, gaming, and other applications, further indicating data theft. It uses threading to perform these actions concurrently and silently, without user consent or notification. The presence of functions to decrypt Chrome/Chromium encrypted data, the use of hardcoded webhook URLs, and the automated collection and exfiltration of sensitive credentials and files are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the code runs automatically upon execution and includes setup metadata that disguises it as a legitimate package, which is a common supply chain attack technique. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily steal sensitive user credentials and data and send them to an attacker-controlled endpoint."
