      "malicious_behavior": "The code automatically scans files on the device storage (including system-like paths such as '/storage/emulated/0' and '/sdcard/DCIM') for files with extensions .py, .php, .zip, and image files (.png, .jpg, .jpeg). It then sends these files and their metadata (file name and path) to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID without any user interaction or consent. This constitutes automated data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user files. The use of hardcoded Telegram bot credentials and chat ID to send documents and photos indicates the code is designed to stealthily collect and transmit user data to an attacker-controlled endpoint. The scanning of broad storage directories and sending of files is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically data theft or spying malware. There is no legitimate user notification, logging, or consent mechanism, and the code runs these operations concurrently in background threads, further indicating stealth and automation. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration malware."
