      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a persistence or evasion mechanism. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further supports malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup call for a package with a suspicious name ('tpnvidiahttpreplace') and author, which is likely a disguise or part of a supply chain attack. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and suspicious package metadata strongly indicates malicious behavior."
