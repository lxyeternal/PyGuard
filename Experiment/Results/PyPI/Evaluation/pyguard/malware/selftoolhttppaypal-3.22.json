      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name 'selftoolhttppaypal' which resembles a typosquatted or misleading name. The combination of obfuscated command execution during package setup, hidden process spawning, and encoded PowerShell commands is a classic hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks or installer-based payload delivery. Therefore, this code is malicious."
