      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It performs conditional checks on sys.platform and sys.argv to trigger hidden behaviors. The code imports modules like pip and win32com, attempts to create and write files in user directories, uses Windows COM objects to create shortcuts, and checks for administrative privileges. It also performs directory walking and file operations with obfuscated paths, indicating attempts to manipulate or deploy files stealthily. The obfuscation, combined with dynamic imports, file system modifications in user/system directories, and use of Windows-specific automation interfaces, strongly indicates malicious intent. Such patterns are typical of malware that tries to persist, execute payloads, or perform system reconnaissance during package installation or execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
