      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is executed with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, a typical stealth technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthy execution of potentially harmful PowerShell commands on Windows systems."
