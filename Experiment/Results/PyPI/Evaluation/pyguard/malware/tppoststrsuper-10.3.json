      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the use of a hidden PowerShell window strongly indicate stealthy, potentially malicious behavior. Additionally, the author and email fields in the setup call reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which are suspicious and may be linked to malicious actors. The overall pattern matches known malware behaviors such as obfuscated code execution, stealth process spawning, and potential payload delivery during package installation. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
