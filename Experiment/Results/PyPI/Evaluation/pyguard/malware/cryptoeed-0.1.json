      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It performs platform checks and command-line argument checks to trigger different behaviors. The code imports modules like pip and win32com, attempts to create and write files in user directories (e.g., environment variables like APPDATA or user home), and uses COM objects to create shortcuts and execute commands. It also checks for administrative privileges and performs directory walking and file operations with suspicious file extensions. The obfuscation and dynamic construction of strings, combined with writing files to system or user directories, creating shortcuts, and executing commands without user consent, are strong indicators of malicious behavior. The code appears to be a supply chain attack or installer script that executes hidden payloads, potentially for persistence, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated code execution during package installation, environment discovery, file system manipulation, and use of Windows COM interfaces for stealthy execution."
