      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the use of a non-standard author email and package name further indicate malicious intent. The use of distutils setup with a try/except block that suppresses errors suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity during package installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, and suspicious package metadata strongly indicates that this code is malicious."
