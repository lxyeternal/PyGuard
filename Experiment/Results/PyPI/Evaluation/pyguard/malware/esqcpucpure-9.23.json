      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) that is executed without user interaction or notification. The command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads, commonly used in malware for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further malicious payloads. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious names ('esqcpucpure', 'EsqueleSquad') and an email address that appears unrelated to legitimate software distribution. The combination of obfuscated command execution during package setup/install and the hidden PowerShell invocation strongly suggests this code is designed for malicious purposes, such as a supply chain attack or malware delivery."
