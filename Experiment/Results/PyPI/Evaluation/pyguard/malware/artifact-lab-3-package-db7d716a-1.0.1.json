      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, during installation, collects all environment variables from the host system and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://ea2de72474be.ngrok.app). This behavior constitutes silent and automatic exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data without user consent or notification. The use of a custom install hook to perform network communication during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector. The environment variables may contain sensitive information such as credentials, tokens, or system configuration details. The hardcoded ngrok domain is attacker-controlled infrastructure commonly used for temporary tunnels, which is suspicious. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and transmission. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern of environment variable collection and exfiltration during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent and is exclusively observed in malware samples. Therefore, this code is malicious."
