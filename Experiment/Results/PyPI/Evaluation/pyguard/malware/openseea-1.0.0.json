      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a base64-encoded and encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent. The obfuscated class name and the use of encrypted payloads further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The setup metadata uses suspicious, random strings for name, author, and description, which is typical of malware trying to disguise itself. The code also specifies installation requirements for 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used in the malicious payload execution. Overall, this is a classic supply chain attack pattern where malicious code is executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution and potential further compromise."
