      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a remote URL and writes it directly into the Windows Startup folder under the user's AppData Roaming path. Writing files to the Startup folder is a classic persistence technique used by malware to ensure execution on system startup without user consent or notification. The code does not perform any validation or user interaction before downloading and saving the file, which could be an executable or script that runs automatically on boot. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as writing files to sensitive system/user directories (Startup folder), downloading files from untrusted remote sources, and enabling persistence mechanisms. Although the code does not explicitly execute the downloaded file, placing it in the Startup folder effectively causes automatic execution on system startup, which is a hallmark of malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
