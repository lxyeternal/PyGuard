      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed dynamically via exec, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation and malicious intent. Upon decoding, the code imports modules to extract Chrome browser cookies, constructs a URL with encoded parameters, and performs an HTTP GET request to that URL. It then writes the response content to a file with a randomized name and executes it using subprocess.Popen with shell=True, running PowerShell in the current working directory. This sequence of actions—collecting sensitive browser cookie data without user consent, encoding and sending it to a remote server, downloading and executing a file from a remote URL, and running PowerShell commands—is a classic pattern of credential-stealing malware and remote code execution. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic code execution, network communication to suspicious endpoints, file writing with randomized names, and spawning of shell processes without user interaction or notification confirms the code's malicious behavior."
