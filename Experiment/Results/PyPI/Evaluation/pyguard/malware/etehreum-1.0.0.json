      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package supply chain attacks. The package name 'etehreum' is suspiciously similar to 'ethereum', indicating possible typosquatting. The encrypted payload is not visible in the source, preventing static analysis of what code is run, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware. The execution happens silently during installation without user interaction or consent, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of 'requests' suggests possible network activity, potentially for downloading further payloads or exfiltrating data. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including code obfuscation, execution of decrypted code during package installation, and suspicious package naming."
