      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, indicating stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware technique. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This behavior is embedded in a setup script, which means the malicious payload executes automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware delivery mechanisms. The rest of the setup code appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
