      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that executes a shell command during the package installation process. Specifically, it runs a reverse shell command using bash to connect back to a hardcoded IP address (114.116.119.253) on port 7777. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malicious code, as it enables remote code execution and unauthorized remote access to the victim's system without user consent or notification. Executing such a reverse shell during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector, allowing attackers to compromise systems when users install the package. The presence of this network connection to a suspicious external IP and the execution of a reverse shell command during install time strongly indicates malicious intent."
