      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is highly obfuscated and uses base64 decoding combined with dynamic compilation and execution (exec and compile) of the decoded payload, which is a classic malware technique. The decoded payload imports modules such as tempfile, sys, os, and urllib.request, and performs network operations by opening URLs from suspicious hardcoded IP addresses (http://20.226.18.203/). It reads data from these URLs and executes it immediately, indicating remote code execution. The code writes to temporary files and executes shell commands that replace file extensions and run executables, all without user interaction or consent. The use of base64 encoding to hide the payload, the immediate execution of remote code, and the network communication to an attacker-controlled IP address are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscation, remote code execution, network communication to suspicious endpoints, and execution of downloaded code, which are hallmark behaviors of malware, including credential stealers or remote access trojans."
