      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The package name 'requiirementsxt' is suspicious and likely a typosquat. The obfuscated description and long description strings further indicate an attempt to hide intent. The use of exec on decrypted data during installation enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent involved. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
