      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential-stealing malware targeting Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and other sensitive user data. It performs multiple malicious actions including: 1) Checking for blacklisted usernames, hostnames, and MAC addresses to avoid running in certain environments. 2) Killing running Discord processes to inject malicious code into Discord client files (index.js) to hijack Discord functionality and exfiltrate data. 3) Collecting Discord tokens, user information, billing data, friends list, badges, and Nitro status by querying Discord APIs with stolen tokens. 4) Extracting saved passwords and cookies from Chromium-based browsers by decrypting encrypted data using Windows DPAPI and AES. 5) Searching user directories for files and folders with keywords related to accounts, passwords, wallets, and tokens, uploading them to anonymous file hosting services. 6) Uploading stolen data and metadata to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for attacker retrieval. 7) Copying itself to the Windows startup folder to maintain persistence. 8) Using threading to perform concurrent data collection and exfiltration stealthily. 9) Installing required Python packages silently via pip commands. 10) Obfuscated and meaningless class and function names to evade detection and analysis. 11) Use of Windows API calls to decrypt sensitive data and manipulate processes. 12) No user interaction or consent is requested; all actions are performed silently in the background. These behaviors match multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including credential theft, data exfiltration, persistence, process injection, and environment evasion. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URLs, injection into Discord client files, and automated uploading of sensitive data confirm the code is malicious."
