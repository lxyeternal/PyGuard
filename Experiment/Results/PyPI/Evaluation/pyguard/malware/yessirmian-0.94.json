      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that executes automatically during package installation. It imports discord-related modules and socket, then in the overridden install.run() method, it sends the host's hostname and IP address to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes silent collection and exfiltration of system information during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration during install time, without user notification or legitimate purpose, strongly indicates malicious intent."
