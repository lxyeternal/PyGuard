      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to execute hidden, potentially malicious PowerShell commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation and stealth execution. The subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution from the user. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the PowerShell command, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' also raise suspicion. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious behavior is triggered automatically during import or execution, not requiring user consent. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup or import is a known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
