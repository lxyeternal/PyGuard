      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a well-known obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates stealth execution without user notification. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled entity. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling remote code execution and potential further payload delivery or system compromise. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
