      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed conditionally on the absence of a directory named 'tahg' suggests stealthy execution of potentially harmful or unauthorized actions. The comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports malicious intent. This pattern of obfuscated command execution via PowerShell in a setup script is a known hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware that execute payloads during package installation or setup. The rest of the code is a typical setup call, but the hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell command during import or setup is a critical risk indicator of malware."
