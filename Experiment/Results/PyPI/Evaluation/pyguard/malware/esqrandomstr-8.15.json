      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window hidden and uses obfuscation to avoid detection. Additionally, the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest suspicious or attacker-controlled identifiers. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during the setup phase is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent or interaction. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: use of subprocess.Popen to spawn PowerShell with encoded commands, execution in hidden mode, obfuscation via base64 encoding, conditional execution based on file system state, and execution triggered during package setup. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
