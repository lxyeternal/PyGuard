      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads, often used in malware to avoid detection and execute arbitrary code silently. This behavior occurs during the import or setup phase, without any user interaction or notification, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscated commands strongly indicates malicious intent."
