      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class for a Python package that, during the installation process, collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (fo7288ar9hjgo6tp8p6c1efxpovgja7z.oastify.com), which is likely attacker-controlled. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent, constituting automated data exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information. Such use of setuptools install hooks to silently collect and transmit environment data to an external server is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the external domain is non-standard and suspicious. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
