      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware and information exfiltration tools. It performs extensive environment reconnaissance by collecting system information such as username, computer name, hardware IDs, IP address, and geolocation. It stealthily extracts sensitive data including browser cookies, saved passwords, credit card information, Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Minecraft files, and other user data from various installed browsers and applications. The code uses Windows API calls to decrypt encrypted credentials and browser data. It also monitors and manipulates the clipboard to replace cryptocurrency wallet addresses with attacker-controlled addresses, a known clipboard hijacking technique to steal cryptocurrency. The malware attempts to evade detection by checking for virtual machine environments, blacklisted process names, and suspicious usernames. It kills Discord-related processes to potentially prevent user detection or token invalidation. The stolen data is compressed into zip archives and exfiltrated to attacker-controlled Discord webhooks and other remote endpoints (e.g., https://kekwltd.ru/relay). The code runs automatically on Windows startup by copying itself to the startup folder. It uses threading to run multiple stealing and exfiltration tasks concurrently in the background without user interaction or consent. The presence of hardcoded attacker URLs, obfuscated variable and function names, and the use of multiple third-party libraries commonly abused in malware (pyperclip, psutil, httpx, requests, pycryptodome, win32crypt) further confirm its malicious intent. Overall, this code is a sophisticated Windows credential stealer and data exfiltration malware designed to silently harvest and transmit sensitive user information to an attacker."
