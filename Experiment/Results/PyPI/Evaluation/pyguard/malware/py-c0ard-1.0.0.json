      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'GruppeInstall' that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated encrypted data and dynamic code execution during package installation is a classic supply chain attack technique, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system. The package name 'py-c0ard' and the meaningless description strings further suggest obfuscation and malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for executing decrypted code during installation, especially without transparency or user consent. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with malware that executes hidden payloads during package installation."
