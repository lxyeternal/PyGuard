      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads from a suspicious URL (notably, the comment references 'www.esquelesquad.rip', which is suspicious). This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware that executes code during package installation without user consent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. The use of try/except to silently ignore errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is malicious and attempts to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during package installation."
