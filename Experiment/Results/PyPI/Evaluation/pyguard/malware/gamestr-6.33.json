      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The PowerShell is run with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a typical stealth technique. This behavior is executed automatically during the setup script execution, which is a known supply chain attack vector where malicious code runs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the code suppresses errors silently, further supporting malicious behavior."
