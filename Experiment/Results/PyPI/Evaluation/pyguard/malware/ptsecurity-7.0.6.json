      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically constructs URLs using the local hostname and then fetches Python code from these remote URLs. It immediately executes the fetched code using exec without any validation or sanitization. This pattern of downloading and executing arbitrary code from external, hardcoded URLs is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The code also conditionally fetches and executes different remote scripts based on the operating system platform, further indicating adaptive malicious payload delivery. The use of try/except blocks to silently ignore errors suppresses any failure notifications, which is typical in malware to evade detection. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate business logic justifying the dynamic execution of remote code. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators such as remote code execution from untrusted sources, automated payload delivery, and potential for data exfiltration or system compromise."
