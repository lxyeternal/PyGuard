      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and CREATE_NO_WINDOW creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the suspicious URL comment (# www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated command string. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic hallmark of malware, often used in supply chain attacks to execute malicious code during installation without user consent or awareness. The presence of a suspicious package name ('tppippinginfo') and author email further supports the malicious intent. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is overshadowed by the covert execution of the encoded PowerShell command. Therefore, this code is malicious."
