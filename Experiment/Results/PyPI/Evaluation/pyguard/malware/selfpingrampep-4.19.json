      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known method for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name 'selfpingrampep' with a package directory 'modlib', which may be typosquatting or misleading. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell command execution during the setup process strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes automatically during package installation without user consent or interaction. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, stealth execution, and unauthorized code execution during installation."
