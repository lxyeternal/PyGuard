      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This technique is a well-known method for stealthy execution of potentially harmful commands or payloads without user interaction or notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command, executed silently during the setup phase of a Python package, strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script for a package named 'esqurlpip' by EsqueleSquad, but the hidden execution of encoded PowerShell commands is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
