      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only if it does not exist, it executes the PowerShell command. The encoded command likely downloads or executes further payloads or performs unauthorized actions. The use of obfuscated (base64) PowerShell commands executed silently during package setup is a classic hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks. The package metadata and author information appear suspicious and do not correspond to known legitimate packages. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during installation, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
