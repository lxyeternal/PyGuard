      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification, and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide its execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to a suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com) to download or execute further payloads, which is a classic pattern of malware that downloads and executes remote code stealthily. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name 'librehackedpull' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which is not typical for benign packages. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with hidden execution and remote code invocation during package setup strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism embedded in the installation process. Therefore, this code is malicious."
