      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated runs. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently during the setup phase (package installation) is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious payload delivery. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution during installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. There is no user interaction or notification, and the code suppresses errors silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
