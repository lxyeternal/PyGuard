      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded Fernet key. This decrypted code execution during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The obfuscation of the class name and the use of encrypted payload executed at install time strongly indicate malicious intent. The package name 'etherum' is suspiciously similar to 'ethereum' (a known cryptocurrency), which is a common typosquatting tactic. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook, further supporting the malicious nature. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful code during installation, which is a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks."
