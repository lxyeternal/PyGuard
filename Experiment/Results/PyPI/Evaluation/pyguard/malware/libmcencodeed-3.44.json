      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The PowerShell command runs in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden) and uses subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to avoid user visibility, which is typical for stealthy malware. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The author and email fields reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which may be suspicious or attacker-controlled. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution during installation, lack of user interaction, and suppression of errors (try/except pass) further confirm malicious intent. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
