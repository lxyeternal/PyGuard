      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' in a hidden manner. This pattern of obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and use of a suspicious external URL is a strong indicator of malware. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of this behavior inside a setup script further suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation. All these factors combined confirm the code is malicious."
