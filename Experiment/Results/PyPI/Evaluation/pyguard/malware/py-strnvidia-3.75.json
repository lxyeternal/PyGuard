      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common obfuscation method to hide the true intent of the command. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The use of subprocess to run obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup or installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Overall, this code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution triggered during package setup, consistent with malware or a supply chain attack."
