      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to execute hidden, potentially harmful commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is a known method to hide the true intent of the command. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist before launching this hidden PowerShell process, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates stealth execution. This behavior is highly indicative of malicious intent, as it executes obfuscated code in a hidden window during the package setup phase, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during installation strongly suggests the package is designed to execute malicious payloads covertly."
