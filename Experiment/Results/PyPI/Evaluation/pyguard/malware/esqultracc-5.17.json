      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or performing system compromise. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious names ('esqultracc', 'EsqueleSquad') and an email address that do not correspond to known legitimate sources, which is typical in typosquatting or malicious packages. The combination of obfuscated command execution during package setup/install and the use of hidden PowerShell processes is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
