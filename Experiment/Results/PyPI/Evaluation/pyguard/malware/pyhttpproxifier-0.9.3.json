      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. Specifically, in the PostEggInfoCommand class's run method, it conditionally (only on Windows systems) fetches a base64-encoded URL (TELEMETRY_INFO), decodes it to get a GitHub raw URL, then downloads content from that URL. The downloaded content is base64-decoded and executed by spawning a new Python process with the decoded code passed as a command-line argument. This dynamic retrieval and execution of remote, obfuscated code during the package installation process (egg_info command) is a classic supply chain attack pattern. It enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL and the payload, combined with subprocess.Popen to run the decoded code in a new process, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, remote code execution, and execution during package installation. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a typical Python HTTP proxy module setup script, and it poses a high risk of compromise."
