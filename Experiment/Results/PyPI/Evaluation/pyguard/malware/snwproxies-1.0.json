      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential-stealing malware targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive user data. It collects tokens from various browsers and Discord clients by accessing local storage files, decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI, and extracts user information such as email, phone, badges, billing info, and friends list via Discord API calls. The stolen data is then exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code also searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files with keywords related to accounts, passwords, and secrets, uploads them to anonfiles-like services, and sends links to the attacker. It uses threading to perform concurrent data collection and exfiltration. The script automatically installs required dependencies if missing, uses obfuscation techniques (base64 decoding, encrypted keys), and runs automatically upon execution. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook, automated extraction and decryption of sensitive credentials, and exfiltration without user consent clearly indicate malicious intent."
