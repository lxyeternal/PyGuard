      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (Base64 encoded). The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and downloads or executes a payload without user interaction or notification. The directory existence check for 'tahg' appears to be a simple evasion or staging check. The use of obfuscated (Base64 encoded) PowerShell commands executed silently during package setup is a classic hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks or trojanized packages. The rest of the code (setup call) appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload execution. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and use of suspicious external URLs. Therefore, this code is malicious."
