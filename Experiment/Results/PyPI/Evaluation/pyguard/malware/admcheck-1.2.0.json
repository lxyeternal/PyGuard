      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cannonation/RoDDoS/main/serv/sv/server.exe) and saves it to a newly created directory (C:\\Kingston) without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately executes this downloaded executable using os.startfile. This pattern of fetching a binary from a remote, untrusted source and executing it directly is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The code also checks for administrative privileges, which is often used by malware to escalate privileges or ensure it can perform system-level actions. The absence of any validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic, combined with the silent download and execution of a potentially untrusted executable, strongly indicates malicious intent."
