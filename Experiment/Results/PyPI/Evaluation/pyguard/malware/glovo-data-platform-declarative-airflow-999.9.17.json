      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the current stack trace, environment variable keys, system uname details, and the public IP address of the host by querying 'https://ipinfo.io/ip'. It then encodes a hardcoded URL using base64 and decodes it at runtime to send this collected information as a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious external endpoint (hooks.slack.com, but the URL is obfuscated). This behavior is consistent with automated data exfiltration without user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding to hide the remote URL, the silent execution of the data collection and transmission upon import or execution, and the immediate program exit after sending the data are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the code attempts to stealthily gather and exfiltrate environment and system information, which aligns with known malware patterns for reconnaissance and data theft."
