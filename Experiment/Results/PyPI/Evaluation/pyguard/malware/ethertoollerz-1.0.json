      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects Steam-related files (ssfn files and config directory) from the user's Program Files (x86) Steam folder without user consent, archives them into a zip file in the TEMP directory, and then silently exfiltrates this archive via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL controlled by an attacker. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive user information (Steam session files), which is a hallmark of credential-stealing or information-stealing malware. The code performs these actions automatically without any user interaction or notification, uses a hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URL, and deletes the temporary archive file afterward to cover tracks. These factors strongly indicate malicious intent."

This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive user data. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration, combined with the lack of any legitimate business logic or user notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to clean up the temporary files afterward, which is a common evasion technique to reduce forensic evidence. These factors align with typical malicious patterns such as automated data theft and covert network communication to attacker-controlled endpoints."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports modules with suspicious and uncommon names such as 'metamask', 'discord', 'exodus', 'machine', 'passwords_cards_cookies', 'screenshot', 'telegram', and 'steam', which are not standard Python libraries and strongly suggest functionality related to credential or token theft, environment information gathering, and data exfiltration. The function 'stha' calls multiple functions like 'yea()', 'find_tokens()', 'runner()', 'machineinfo()', 'sikrinsat()', and 'telegram()', all wrapped in try-except blocks to suppress errors, indicating attempts to stealthily execute potentially malicious payloads. The naming and import patterns strongly resemble typical malware behavior that collects sensitive data such as wallet credentials (Metamask, Exodus), Discord tokens, machine information, screenshots, and sends data via Telegram. The code immediately spawns threads to run these functions in the background without any user interaction or notification, which is a common evasion and persistence technique in malware. The presence of modules named after cryptocurrency wallets and token finders, combined with silent execution and data collection, aligns with known credential-stealing malware patterns. There is no legitimate or benign context, user consent, or transparency in the code. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including automated credential theft, environment reconnaissance, stealth execution, and potential data exfiltration."

It collects these tokens without user consent and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is attacker-controlled. This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential theft and data exfiltration. The code accesses sensitive environment variables to locate user data folders, reads potentially sensitive files, extracts authentication tokens, and transmits them silently to an external server. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and exfiltration. Such behavior is a hallmark of malicious credential-stealing malware."

It copies these directories to a temporary folder, archives them into a zip file, and then sends the archive via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive user information (browser extension data, which may include wallet or credential data). The code operates silently without user interaction or consent, uses hardcoded attacker-controlled endpoints, and automates the collection and transmission of user data. These are classic hallmarks of malicious credential-stealing or information-stealing malware."

This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user information. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for automatic, silent transmission of user screen content is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it collects and sends private data without notification or permission. Additionally, the code attempts to delete the temporary screenshot file afterward to cover its tracks, further indicating stealthy, malicious activity."

This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of sensitive user credentials or session data. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration, absence of user notification, and targeting of private user data are strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with credential-stealing malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a clear example of malicious behavior, specifically a credential stealer targeting multiple Chromium-based browsers on Windows. It enumerates installed browsers by checking known user data paths, then extracts sensitive data such as saved passwords, cookies, credit card information, browsing history, and download history from browser profile databases. It uses Windows API (win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData) and AES decryption to decrypt encrypted passwords and credit card numbers. The stolen data is saved temporarily in the user's AppData Local Temp directory, then compressed into a zip archive. Finally, the archive is exfiltrated by uploading it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is attacker-controlled infrastructure. The code performs all these actions silently without user consent or notification, uses temporary file copies to avoid locking issues, and deletes temporary files after use to evade detection. The presence of hardcoded attacker webhook, automated extraction of sensitive credentials, and network exfiltration of stolen data are definitive indicators of malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware."

It then packages this sensitive information into a JSON payload formatted as a Discord webhook embed and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of sensitive system and network information without any user interaction or consent. The use of a hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URL for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such data collection and transmission patterns are typical of information-stealing malware or reconnaissance components of malware. The code imports modules commonly used in malware (requests, wmi, psutil, subprocess) and performs environment discovery and network communication in a single automated flow. Although the function is not called in the snippet, the presence of this function and the hardcoded webhook strongly suggests the code is designed for malicious data exfiltration."
