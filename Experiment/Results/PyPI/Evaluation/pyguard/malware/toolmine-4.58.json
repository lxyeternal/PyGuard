      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, a typical stealth technique. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently during the setup script execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads without user consent or interaction. This behavior aligns with known supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscated commands during installation is a critical risk indicator of malware."
