      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a typical evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup strongly suggest a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during installation. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup call, likely used as a cover. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and conditional execution based on file system state is a hallmark of malicious code."
