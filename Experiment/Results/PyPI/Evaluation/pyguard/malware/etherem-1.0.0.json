      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded string and decrypted at runtime, then executed immediately without any user interaction or validation. This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and execution during install time strongly indicates that the package attempts to run hidden malicious code on the victim's machine during installation. Such behavior is not typical for benign packages and is a critical risk indicator of malware."
