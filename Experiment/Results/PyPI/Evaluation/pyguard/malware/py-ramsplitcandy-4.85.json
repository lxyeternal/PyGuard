      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized or harmful actions, as suggested by the suspicious domain 'www.esquelesquad.rip' in the comment and the obfuscation of the command. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware embedded in Python packages. The code attempts to execute this payload automatically during the package setup without user interaction or consent, which is a critical risk behavior. The rest of the setup code appears normal but is overshadowed by the covert execution of the encoded PowerShell command. Therefore, this code is malicious."
