      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It conditionally imports modules like 'pip' and 'win32com', attempts to create and write files in user directories, and uses Windows COM interfaces to create and save shortcuts. It also checks for administrative privileges and performs directory walking to find files with specific extensions, then creates shortcuts to these files. The code runs during the setup phase of a Python package installation, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The obfuscation, combined with file system manipulation, privilege checks, and use of Windows COM objects to create shortcuts, strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at persistence or spreading on Windows systems. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated code execution during package installation, environment awareness, file system manipulation, and use of Windows-specific APIs for potentially harmful actions."
