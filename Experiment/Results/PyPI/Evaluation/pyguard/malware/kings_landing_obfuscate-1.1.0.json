      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command and executes automatically during package installation. It collects sensitive system information such as OS details (via 'uname -a' or 'systeminfo'), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP address (via 'curl ifconfig.me'), current user ('whoami'), and hostname. It then sends all this collected information in a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL, which is an external, attacker-controlled endpoint. This behavior constitutes silent data exfiltration of system and user identity information without user consent or notification. The use of shell commands to gather environment details combined with immediate network transmission during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious code. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the hardcoded webhook URL strongly indicates malicious intent."
