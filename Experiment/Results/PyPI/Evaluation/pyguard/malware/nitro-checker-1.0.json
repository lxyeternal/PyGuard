      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically during the setup process, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload imports modules for temporary file handling, system execution, and URL opening, then downloads and executes code from a hardcoded suspicious URL ('https://z3us.online/grab/miYOxGLuqZNlRESL'). This behavior is typical of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation without user consent. The use of exec and compile on decoded base64 data, combined with network retrieval and immediate execution, is a hallmark of malware. The code runs automatically on install, contacts an external server to fetch and execute code, and does so in an obfuscated manner, all of which are critical risk indicators of malicious behavior."
