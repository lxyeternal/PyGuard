      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It includes extensive use of base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and executed dynamically via exec, which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique. The code performs environment reconnaissance by collecting system and user information, including usernames and system paths, and sends this data to hardcoded, suspicious external IP addresses and URLs. It also downloads and executes additional code from remote sources without user consent, leveraging Python package installation hooks to run malicious payloads during package setup. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed in hidden mode, automated file creation and deletion in system or user directories, and network communication to attacker-controlled servers further confirm its malicious intent. The code also attempts to evade detection by using threading to run background tasks and by suppressing output. Overall, this code is designed for stealthy execution, data exfiltration, remote code execution, and persistence, which are hallmark behaviors of malware and supply chain attacks."
