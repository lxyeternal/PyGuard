      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then launches this hidden PowerShell command, which is obfuscated via base64 encoding to hide its intent. This pattern—obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup—is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a package named 'nvidiaproof' with suspicious author information and no legitimate user interaction or notification before the background activity begins. The presence of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered automatically during installation without user consent or transparency strongly indicates malicious intent."
