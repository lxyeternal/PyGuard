      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a typical stealth behavior. The presence of a suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further suggests malicious intent. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or a cover to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package, but the actual malicious payload is the hidden PowerShell execution. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated base64-encoded shell commands, hidden process execution, and execution during package setup without user interaction or consent. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
