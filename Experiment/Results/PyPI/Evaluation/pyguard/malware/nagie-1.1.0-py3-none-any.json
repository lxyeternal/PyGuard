      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://nagogy-cdn.dreamyoak.repl.co/cdn/KGK8zSTh.exe) without any user interaction or consent, writes it to the current working directory as 'windows.exe', and immediately executes it using a shell command (os.system(\"start windows.exe\")). This sequence of automated file download and execution from an untrusted remote source is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system. There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification before execution, increasing the risk of running malicious payloads. The use of a non-standard domain and direct execution of a downloaded binary strongly indicates malicious intent."
