      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed with the 'Hidden' window style and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely contains obfuscated instructions, which is a common tactic used by malware to evade detection. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which may be used as a persistence or evasion mechanism. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup call for a package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window, lack of user interaction, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates that this code is malicious."
