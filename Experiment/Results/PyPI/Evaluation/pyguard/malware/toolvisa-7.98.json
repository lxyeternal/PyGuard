      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The base64-encoded command is not directly visible, but the invocation pattern strongly suggests obfuscated and hidden execution. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means the malicious payload executes automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The package name 'toolvisa' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' do not correspond to known legitimate software, increasing suspicion. The try-except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window, conditional execution based on file system state, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
