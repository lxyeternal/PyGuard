      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It defines a Python package setup script that hijacks the installation process by overriding the setuptools 'install' command. During installation, it writes a Python script named 'remote-access.py' containing code that establishes a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP address (82.157.252.61) on port 1234. This reverse shell code supports both Windows and Linux platforms, spawning a command shell ('cmd' on Windows, '/bin/bash' on Linux) and redirecting input/output over the network socket. The script is moved to a user directory (home or Documents) without user consent and executed silently in the background. This behavior enables an attacker to gain unauthorized remote command execution on the victim's machine, bypassing firewalls by initiating outbound connections. The use of subprocess.Popen to spawn shells, threading to handle communication, hardcoded attacker-controlled IP, and execution triggered automatically during package installation are all hallmark indicators of a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor. There is no legitimate user interaction, notification, or consent, and the code is designed to run stealthily. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern abusing Python package installation hooks to deliver and execute malicious payloads."
