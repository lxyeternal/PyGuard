      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command, the check for a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution), and the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) strongly suggest stealthy, unauthorized code execution. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware that attempts to execute hidden payloads or perform unauthorized actions during package installation or setup. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is used here as a cover or delivery mechanism. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script without user consent or transparency is a critical risk and confirms malicious intent."
