      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains strong indicators of malicious behavior. It includes base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and immediately executed via exec(), which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique used by malware. The code conditionally executes different base64-decoded payloads depending on the operating system, indicating platform-specific malicious actions. The decoded payloads perform network communications to suspicious or attacker-controlled endpoints, collect system and user information, and execute shell commands without user consent or interaction. The presence of obfuscated imports, dynamic code execution during package installation (setup.py), and the use of threading and subprocesses to run hidden or background tasks further confirm malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to write files to system or user directories, likely for persistence or payload deployment. These behaviors align with known supply chain attacks, credential theft, data exfiltration, and remote code execution malware patterns. Therefore, this code is malicious."
