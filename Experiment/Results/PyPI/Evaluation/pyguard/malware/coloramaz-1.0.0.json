      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary decrypted code during package installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). Specifically, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a base64-encoded payload and immediately executes it with exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The obfuscated encrypted payload conceals the true intent of the executed code, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of exec on decrypted data during installation, combined with network-related imports (requests) and obfuscation, strongly suggests that the package is designed to run hidden malicious code on the victim's machine during installation, potentially enabling remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further payload delivery."
