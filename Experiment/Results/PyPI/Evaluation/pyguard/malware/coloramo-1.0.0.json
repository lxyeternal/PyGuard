      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'GruppeInstall' that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec(). The decryption key and the encrypted payload are hardcoded, and the decrypted payload is executed immediately without any user interaction or validation. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious behavior because it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The obfuscation via Fernet encryption and immediate execution of decrypted code during install time is a hallmark of malware attempting to evade detection and execute unauthorized actions on the victim system. Additionally, the package metadata fields (name, author, description) appear obfuscated or nonsensical, which is common in malicious packages to avoid easy detection. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
