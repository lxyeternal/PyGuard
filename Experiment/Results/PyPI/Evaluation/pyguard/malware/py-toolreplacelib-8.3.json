      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated runs. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide the window further indicates stealthy behavior. Additionally, the setup() call with a suspicious package name 'py-toolreplacelib' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' hints at a possible supply chain attack or malicious package masquerading as a legitimate library. The comment '# www.esquelesquad.rip' references a suspicious domain. All these factors combined—obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, suspicious package metadata, and lack of legitimate user interaction—are strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with malware patterns such as remote code execution, payload delivery, or persistence mechanisms."
