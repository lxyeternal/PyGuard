      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It contains heavily obfuscated base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and executed dynamically using exec, which is a classic technique for hiding malicious code. The code executes during package installation (setup.py context), which is a known supply chain attack vector. It performs environment reconnaissance by collecting system and user information, including usernames and system paths, and sends this data to external, hardcoded IP addresses and URLs, indicating data exfiltration. The code also downloads and executes additional remote code without user consent, uses threading to run background tasks stealthily, and manipulates system files and directories in ways typical of malware. The presence of encoded PowerShell commands, network communication to suspicious endpoints, and absence of legitimate user interaction further confirm its malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to perform unauthorized data collection, remote code execution, and persistence, making it highly malicious."
