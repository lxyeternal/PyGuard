      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to perform malicious actions during package installation. Specifically, it checks for administrator privileges and if not present, attempts to elevate privileges by re-running itself with admin rights. Then, it silently downloads a file named 'image.png' from a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (http://wpp-api-01hw.onrender.com/api/images/1140884481671188581/image.png) using the requests library with a custom header. The downloaded file is then read, base64-decoded, and executed directly via exec(). This pattern of fetching remote code, decoding it, and executing it during package installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The code performs no user notification or consent, uses obfuscation (base64 encoding), and executes arbitrary code from an untrusted source, which is highly indicative of malicious intent. The use of a suspicious external domain, execution of downloaded code without validation, and automatic privilege escalation attempts confirm that this code is malicious."

It extracts a 'code' field from the JSON response and immediately executes it using exec(). This pattern of retrieving code from an untrusted remote source and executing it dynamically is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It enables remote code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's system. The absence of any integrity checks, user consent, or sandboxing further confirms the high risk. Such behavior is commonly observed in malware for payload delivery, backdoors, or data exfiltration."
