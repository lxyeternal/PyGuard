      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized or harmful actions, as suggested by the suspicious domain comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the creation of a directory named 'tahg' as a condition to run the payload. This pattern of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with hidden PowerShell execution is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for payload delivery, persistence, or remote code execution. Additionally, the code executes this payload automatically during the setup process without user interaction or consent, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious packages. The rest of the setup code appears to be a decoy or cover, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution makes the entire script malicious."
