      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the embedded URL-like string in the comment and the obfuscated command. This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup or installation is a hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading/executing additional malicious payloads. The presence of try/except blocks suppressing errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The package metadata (author, email, and description) appears suspicious and likely fabricated to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, this code is a supply chain attack vector that executes hidden, obfuscated commands without user consent or interaction, which is a critical risk and confirms malicious behavior."
