      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated class name and encrypted payload conceal the true intent, and the use of exec on decrypted data is a critical risk indicator. The code executes arbitrary code during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, system compromise, or further payload delivery. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a standard setup script, and the presence of network-related imports (requests) suggests potential for further malicious network activity within the decrypted payload."
