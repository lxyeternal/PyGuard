      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed via exec, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL (https://pastebin.com/raw/hEF5HaFc), reads the response, writes it to a file named 'pkg_installer.exe', and then executes this file via a shell command. Immediately after execution, it attempts to remove the file. This sequence of downloading an executable from an untrusted external source, executing it without user consent, and cleaning up traces is a classic pattern of malware delivery and execution. The use of base64 encoding to hide the payload, execution during package setup (which can be triggered automatically on installation), and network communication to a non-official domain further confirm the malicious nature. Therefore, this code is performing a supply chain attack by executing arbitrary code during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
