      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It performs conditional checks on command-line arguments and platform, then enters loops with large numeric conditions that control execution flow. The code imports modules like 'pip' and 'win32com.client.Dispatch' dynamically, attempts to create and write files in user directories (e.g., using environment variables like APPDATA), and creates Windows shortcuts. It also uses Windows COM interfaces to create shortcuts and manipulate files, which is a common persistence or payload delivery technique. The obfuscation and dynamic behavior strongly suggest attempts to evade detection. The code appears to execute during package setup, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The presence of complex obfuscated logic, file system writes to user directories, dynamic imports of system modules, and shortcut creation without user consent are hallmark behaviors of malware, especially credential stealers or persistence mechanisms. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
