      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command. The presence of an obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell command executed silently without user interaction or notification is a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest suspicious origins. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. This pattern—executing obfuscated shell commands during package setup or installation—is a known supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code is malicious."
