      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally based on the absence of a directory named 'tahg' suggests stealth and evasion techniques. The comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports malicious intent. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a known hallmark of malware, often used for payload delivery, persistence, or remote code execution. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a cover or delivery mechanism. Therefore, this code is malicious."
