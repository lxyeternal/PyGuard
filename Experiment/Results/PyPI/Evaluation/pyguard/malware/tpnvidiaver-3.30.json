      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (# www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated command string. This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a background process without user interaction or notification is a hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading/executing additional malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'tpnvidiaver' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an unusual email address may indicate a typosquatted or suspicious package, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to silently suppress errors further suggests an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during import or setup is highly suspicious and malicious."
