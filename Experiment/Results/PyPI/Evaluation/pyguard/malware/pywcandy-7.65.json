      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to run PowerShell commands without user visibility. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The use of obfuscated (Base64-encoded) PowerShell commands executed silently during package setup or installation is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for payload delivery, persistence, or further malicious actions. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the obfuscation combined with stealth execution strongly suggests malicious intent."
