      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads two executable files from hardcoded, external URLs hosted on Discord's CDN and saves them to a hidden system directory (C:\\$Windows.~SXK). It then immediately executes these downloaded executables without any user interaction or consent. The directory is created silently if it does not exist, and the executables are renamed to obfuscated filenames before execution. After launching the executables, the code attempts to delete the directory containing them. This sequence of automated downloading, writing, renaming, and executing untrusted binaries from remote sources, combined with the use of a hidden system-like directory and silent cleanup, is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, commonly seen in malware for payload delivery and execution. The package metadata also suspiciously describes itself as 'A very basic hacking module' with keywords like 'hack', further indicating malicious intent. There is no legitimate or benign reason for such behavior in typical Python packages or scripts."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a folder disguised as a Windows system folder (C:\\$Windows.~SXK), downloads an executable file from a hardcoded external URL (a Discord CDN link), saves it into that folder with a suspicious name (XMICNEI.exe), and immediately executes it without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic pattern of malware that downloads and runs a potentially untrusted payload silently. The use of a disguised folder name to evade casual detection, the direct network retrieval of an executable, and the immediate execution of that executable are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or validation of the downloaded content, which further confirms the malicious nature of this code."
