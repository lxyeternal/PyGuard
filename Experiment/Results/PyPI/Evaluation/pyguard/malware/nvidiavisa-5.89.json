      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware to evade detection. The base64-encoded command likely contains a PowerShell script that performs unauthorized or malicious actions, such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means the malicious payload executes automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The package name 'nvidiavisa' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and unrelated to the legitimate NVIDIA brand, suggesting typosquatting or impersonation. The try-except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection and ensure silent execution. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, conditional execution based on file system state, and embedding in a package setup script strongly indicates malicious behavior."
