      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated in base64 UTF-16LE format, which is a common technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name 'esqmccpunvidia' further indicate malicious intent. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or a way to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and suspicious naming conventions strongly indicates that this code is designed to execute malicious payloads stealthily, consistent with known malware behaviors."
