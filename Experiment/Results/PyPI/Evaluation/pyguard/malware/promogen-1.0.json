      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Windows systems, specifically extracting sensitive information from browsers and Discord clients. It collects Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords, billing information, and user environment data such as IP address and username. The code decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows APIs and AES decryption, then exfiltrates this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. It also compresses and uploads various user data files to anonymous file hosting services, sending the resulting links to the attacker. The code runs automatically upon execution, without user consent or notification, and uses threading to perform stealthy background data collection and exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URLs, environment variable access to sensitive directories, decryption of protected data, and automated network exfiltration are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setuptools setup script, which could be used to execute this malicious payload during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. All these factors confirm that the code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealing user credentials and sensitive data."
