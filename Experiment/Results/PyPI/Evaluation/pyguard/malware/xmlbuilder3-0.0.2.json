      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class (CustomInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it runs a subprocess that executes a module named 'poc_nvk.my_module' using the Python interpreter. This behavior is suspicious because it triggers arbitrary code execution automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. The package name 'xmlbuilder3' and the module path 'poc_nvk' do not correspond to known legitimate packages, and the description 'DEPEndency C0nfusion P0C for Mirantis' suggests a proof-of-concept for dependency confusion attacks, a known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during installation is a common technique used in malicious Python packages to run payloads on the victim's system. The absence of any validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic before running the subprocess further supports the conclusion that this code is malicious and intended to execute unauthorized code during package installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including the hostname, operating system name, and IP address, then automatically sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://eowdq5q6u6qkhxe.m.pipedream.net/poc) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. This behavior matches known malicious patterns of silent environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints. The use of a hardcoded suspicious webhook URL and automated data transmission without legitimate business logic or user consent strongly indicates malicious intent."
