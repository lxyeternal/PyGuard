      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1109115014054416495/1109465188433936425/Windows.exe) without any validation or user consent, writes it to a temporary file, and immediately executes it using subprocess.call. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious behavior because it enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted remote source. There is no user interaction, no integrity checks, no notification, and no legitimate business logic between the download and execution steps. The use of a Discord CDN URL to host the executable is suspicious and typical of malware delivery. This sequence matches multiple critical risk indicators such as automated file download and execution, lack of validation, execution of remote payloads, and absence of user consent, all of which are hallmark behaviors of malware."
