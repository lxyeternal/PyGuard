      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' suppresses any visible window, which is a stealth technique. This behavior is executed automatically during the setup script execution, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code runs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscated commands strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with encoded commands, and this pattern is a well-known hallmark of malware attempting to execute hidden payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the host system."
