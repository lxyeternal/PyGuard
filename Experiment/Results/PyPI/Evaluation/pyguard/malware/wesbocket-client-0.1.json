      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It conditionally imports modules like 'pip' and 'win32com', attempts to create and write files in user directories, and uses Windows COM interfaces to create shortcuts and execute commands. It performs environment checks, including admin rights verification, and iterates over filesystem directories to find and manipulate files with suspicious extensions. The code also uses obfuscated string construction and dynamic execution patterns typical of malware. The presence of such obfuscation, combined with file system manipulation, COM shortcut creation, and conditional execution based on command-line arguments, strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with credential theft, persistence mechanisms, or payload deployment. This code is likely part of a supply chain attack or malware payload executed during package installation, which is a known vector for malicious activity."
