      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (Base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip hints at a malicious source). This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script but contains this covert execution, indicating it is designed to execute malicious payloads during installation."
