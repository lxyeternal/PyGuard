      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname (os.uname().nodename), the current call stack (traceback.extract_stack()), environment variable keys, and the public IP address (via https://ipinfo.io/ip). It then encodes a hardcoded URL using base64 to obfuscate the destination and sends this collected data as a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to that external URL. This exfiltration occurs automatically upon execution without any user interaction or consent. The use of base64 encoding to hide the remote endpoint, the automatic data collection and transmission, and the immediate program termination (exit(1)) to evade further analysis are all strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to evade analysis by skipping execution if run on known bot hostnames or known analysis scripts. These behaviors align with typical malware patterns of environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, making this code malicious."
