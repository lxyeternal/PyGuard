      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The PowerShell process is started with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a known stealth technique. The presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or a cover for the malicious payload execution during installation. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell command execution, stealth process spawning, and conditional execution during package setup is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware installation routines."
