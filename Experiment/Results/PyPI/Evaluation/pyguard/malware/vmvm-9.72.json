      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands, often used by malware to evade detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then launches this hidden PowerShell process, indicating an attempt to execute a payload conditionally and stealthily. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands, execution in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), and lack of user interaction or notification are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover or delivery mechanism. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered automatically during setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
