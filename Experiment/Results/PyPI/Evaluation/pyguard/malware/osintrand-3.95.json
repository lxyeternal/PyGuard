      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an -EncodedCommand argument. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script, which is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. Running PowerShell in hidden mode with an encoded command is a well-known method for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads, such as downloading and executing further malware, persistence, or privilege escalation. This behavior is triggered automatically during the setup script execution, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks in Python packages. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during installation strongly indicates malicious intent."
