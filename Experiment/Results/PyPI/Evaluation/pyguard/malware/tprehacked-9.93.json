      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup or installation is a hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the package name 'tprehacked' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email address 'tahgoficial@proton.me' and a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' further suggest malicious intent. The use of distutils setup with a try/except block that suppresses errors also indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity during installation. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and consistent with known malware patterns involving obfuscated, hidden execution of PowerShell commands during package installation."
