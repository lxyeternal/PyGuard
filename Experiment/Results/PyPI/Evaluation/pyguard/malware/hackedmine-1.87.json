      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to execute hidden, potentially harmful commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands, indicating an attempt to hide the true intent of the command. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. Additionally, the package setup metadata uses a suspicious package name 'hackedmine' and an author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which are unusual and potentially malicious. The overall pattern—obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup/install, hidden execution, and lack of user consent—is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware payload delivery."
