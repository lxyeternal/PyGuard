      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. The command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealth execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the payload, which suggests evasion or persistence logic. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and may be linked to malicious actors. The rest of the code is a setup call for a package named 'tptoolmask' with a plausible description, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. The immediate execution of obfuscated PowerShell code during import or setup without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware installation routines. Therefore, this code is malicious."
