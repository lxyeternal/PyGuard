      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a typical stealth behavior. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. This pattern of executing obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup is a known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
