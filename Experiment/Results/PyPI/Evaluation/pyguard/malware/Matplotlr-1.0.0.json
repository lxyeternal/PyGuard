      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent or interaction. The obfuscated class name and the use of encrypted payload hide the true intent of the code, which is typical of malware attempting to evade detection. Additionally, the package name 'Matplotlr' is suspiciously similar to a popular package 'matplotlib', indicating possible typosquatting. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook, further supporting the malicious intent. Overall, this code is a supply chain attack vector that executes hidden malicious code during installation, which is a critical security risk."
