      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only then executes the PowerShell command, which is a common evasion technique. The presence of a suspicious hardcoded URL in the commented line (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated PowerShell command strongly indicate that the code is attempting to execute a hidden payload or perform unauthorized actions. This pattern of obfuscated command execution during package setup or installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution is malicious."
