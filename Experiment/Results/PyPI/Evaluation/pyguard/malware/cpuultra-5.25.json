      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. This pattern—executing obfuscated PowerShell commands in hidden mode during package setup—is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly seen in supply chain attacks or malware that executes payloads during installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears legitimate but is used here as a cover to execute the hidden PowerShell payload. There is no user interaction or notification, and the code suppresses exceptions silently, which is typical for malware trying to avoid detection. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
