      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed environment and system information including the host identity (via os.uname), user home directory, environment variables, and current working directory. It then serializes this data to JSON, encodes it in base64, and sends it via an HTTP request to a remote server with a suspicious Host header ('psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net'). This pattern of silent environment data collection and exfiltration without user consent or notification is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being sent further supports this. Although the code does not execute remote code or spawn processes, the automated, covert collection and transmission of potentially sensitive system information to an external endpoint is consistent with information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate user interaction or business logic justifying this behavior, and the endpoint and headers appear crafted to evade detection or masquerade as legitimate traffic."
