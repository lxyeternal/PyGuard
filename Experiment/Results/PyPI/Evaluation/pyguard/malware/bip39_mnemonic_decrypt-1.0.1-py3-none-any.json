      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function decrypt_jsBIP39 that decodes a base64-encoded URL and then sends an HTTP POST request to that decoded URL with the provided payload encoded in base64. The URL decoded is 'http://5.42.92.191:5000/post', which is a hardcoded, suspicious IP address and port, not a known or trusted domain. The function cli_keccak256 sends data to this external server without any user interaction or notification, indicating automated data exfiltration. The payload parameter is sent as a base64-encoded 'license' field, which suggests it may be used to exfiltrate sensitive information. This pattern of obfuscation (base64 encoding of the URL), hardcoded suspicious external endpoint, and automated network communication without user consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with data exfiltration or credential theft malware. The rest of the code implements a Snappy decompression routine, which by itself is benign, but the presence of the decrypt_jsBIP39 function with network exfiltration capability makes the overall code malicious."
