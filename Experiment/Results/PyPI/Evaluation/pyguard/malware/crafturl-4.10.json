      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. The use of Base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with silent execution in the background without user interaction or notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware that tries to execute hidden payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the system during package installation or setup. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during import or setup is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."
