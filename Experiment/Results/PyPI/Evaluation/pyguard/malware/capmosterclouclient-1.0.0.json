      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class GruppeInstall that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package setup scripts. The package name and metadata are obfuscated and nonsensical, which is typical of malware attempting to disguise itself. The use of exec on decrypted data during installation enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine, which can lead to remote code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise. This behavior aligns with known supply chain attacks and is strongly indicative of malicious intent."
