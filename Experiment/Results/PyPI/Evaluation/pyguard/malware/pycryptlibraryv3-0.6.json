      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware and information exfiltration tools. It performs extensive environment reconnaissance by collecting system information such as username, computer name, hardware IDs, IP address, and geographic location. It stealthily extracts sensitive data including browser cookies, saved passwords, credit card information, Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Minecraft files, and other user data from various installed browsers and applications. The code uses Windows APIs to decrypt encrypted credentials and cookies. It also monitors and manipulates the clipboard to replace cryptocurrency wallet addresses with attacker-controlled addresses, a known clipboard hijacking technique to steal cryptocurrency. The malware attempts to evade detection by checking for virtual machine environments, blacklisted process names, and suspicious usernames or hardware IDs. It kills Discord-related processes to potentially prevent user detection or token invalidation. The stolen data is compressed into zip archives and exfiltrated to attacker-controlled Discord webhooks and other remote endpoints (e.g., prepaidroot.ru). The code installs numerous Python packages silently, uses obfuscated variable and function names, and runs multiple threads for concurrent data theft and exfiltration. It also includes mechanisms to persist by copying itself to the Windows startup folder. The presence of hardcoded suspicious URLs, webhook URLs, and cryptographic keys, combined with the lack of user consent or notification, confirms the code is designed for unauthorized data theft and remote information exfiltration. This code is a sophisticated Python-based stealer malware targeting Windows systems."
