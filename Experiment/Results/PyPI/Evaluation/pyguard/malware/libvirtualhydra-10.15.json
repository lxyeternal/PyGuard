      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window, CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag), which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful commands. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed during the setup phase (package installation) strongly indicate a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the hidden execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands during installation is a hallmark of malware attempting to execute unauthorized code on the victim's system without user consent or notification."
