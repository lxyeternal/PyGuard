      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking a web request to a suspicious URL (notably 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0') and executing a file named 'WindowsCache.exe'. This pattern of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and remote payload invocation is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for downloading and executing secondary payloads without user consent. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad', 'tahgoficial@proton.me'), and the package name 'tpcandycontrolpush' is unusual and potentially typosquatted. The code runs this malicious payload automatically during the setup process without any user interaction or notification, which is typical of supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code is malicious."
