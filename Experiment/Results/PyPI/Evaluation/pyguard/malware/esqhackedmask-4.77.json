      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, further indicating stealthy execution. Additionally, the package setup metadata uses suspicious names such as 'esqhackedmask' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which are unusual and potentially typosquatted or attacker-controlled. The presence of a comment with a suspicious URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' also suggests malicious intent. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, and suspicious package metadata strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware payload delivery during package installation."
