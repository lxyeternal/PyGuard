      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive user data. It collects tokens and credentials from multiple browsers and Discord client folders by decrypting stored passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption. The code then exfiltrates this stolen data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without user consent. It also searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files with keywords related to passwords, accounts, wallets, and uploads them to an anonymous file hosting service, further exfiltrating potentially sensitive files. The code uses threading to perform these actions concurrently and suppresses errors to evade detection. It installs required dependencies silently if missing. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook, automated collection of sensitive credentials, decryption of encrypted browser data, and exfiltration of this data to an attacker-controlled endpoint are definitive indicators of malicious behavior. Additionally, the code runs automatically upon execution and during package setup, indicating a supply chain attack vector. All these factors confirm that this code is malicious and designed for unauthorized data theft and exfiltration."
