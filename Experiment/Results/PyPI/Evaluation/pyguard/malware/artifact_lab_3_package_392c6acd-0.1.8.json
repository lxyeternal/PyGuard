      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell, which is a classic malicious behavior. It creates a socket connection to a hardcoded external host and port (4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:10308), then redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to this socket. It subsequently executes a bash shell command that opens an interactive shell over the network connection, effectively giving remote control of the victim machine to the attacker. This behavior enables unauthorized remote command execution and control, bypassing firewalls and network monitoring by initiating an outbound connection. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate business logic, and the code is designed to stealthily provide remote access, which is a hallmark of malware such as remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors."
