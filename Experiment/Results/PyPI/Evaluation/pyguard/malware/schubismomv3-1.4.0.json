      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'GruppeInstall' that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it writes a Python script named 'gruppe.py' into the user's APPDATA directory. This script contains obfuscated code that decrypts and executes a large encrypted payload using the 'fernet' module. Immediately after writing this file, the installer launches it as a detached, hidden process (using subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW and DETACHED_PROCESS flags), causing the decrypted code to run silently in the background without user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is executed during package installation to deploy and run hidden payloads. The use of encrypted payloads, writing to obscure user directories, and silent background execution are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious keywords like 'ratting' and an offensive description, further suggesting malicious purpose. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with malware that executes hidden payloads during installation."
