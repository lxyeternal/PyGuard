      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed in hidden mode is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, often used for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading and executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The setup function call appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except that suppresses errors, which can be used to hide malicious activity during package installation. The author and email fields reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which may be suspicious or attacker-controlled. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and silent error handling strongly indicates malicious intent."
