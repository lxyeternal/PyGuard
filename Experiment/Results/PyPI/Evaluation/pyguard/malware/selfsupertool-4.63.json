      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification, and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide its execution. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be used as a marker or persistence mechanism. The setup() call with the suspicious author name 'EsqueleSquad' and email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests this is a malicious package attempting a supply chain attack by executing code during installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
