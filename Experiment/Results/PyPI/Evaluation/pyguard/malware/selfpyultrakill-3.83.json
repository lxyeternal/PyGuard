      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command and execute it stealthily without user interaction or notification. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands, and the command is executed in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists and only then executes the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. The use of subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated command during package setup is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or malicious package installation behavior. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and is not typical of benign Python packages."
