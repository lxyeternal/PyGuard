      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window style), which is a well-known technique used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary code without user consent or notification. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the PowerShell command suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or unnecessary runs, a common evasion tactic. Additionally, the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' hint at a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The rest of the code is a setup call for a Python package, which appears to be a cover or delivery mechanism for the malicious payload. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process creation, and the context of execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
