      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It hooks into the Python package installation process (setup.py) and performs actions during build/install commands on Windows platforms. It attempts to install the 'pypiwin32' package silently if missing, then creates a hidden Chrome extension in the user's APPDATA directory under '\\Extension'. This extension contains obfuscated JavaScript code that repeatedly replaces clipboard contents with specific cryptocurrency addresses, a classic clipboard hijacking technique to steal cryptocurrency transactions. The script modifies shortcuts (.lnk files) on the user's Start Menu, Taskbar, and Desktop to inject the extension loading argument into browsers like chrome.exe, msedge.exe, brave.exe, and launcher.exe, ensuring the malicious extension loads whenever these browsers start. It also writes a manifest.json granting clipboard read/write permissions to the extension, enabling clipboard manipulation. The use of obfuscated JavaScript, silent file writes to user and system directories, modification of user shortcuts without consent, and clipboard hijacking are hallmark malicious behaviors. These actions occur automatically during package installation without user interaction or notification, consistent with supply chain attack patterns. Therefore, this code is malicious."
