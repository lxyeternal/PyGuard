      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before launching the PowerShell process suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further indicate suspicious origins. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is triggered during import or installation. This pattern—executing obfuscated PowerShell commands in a hidden window during package setup—is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware delivery mechanisms."
