      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and immediately executes the decoded content via exec. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the code and executes it without any user interaction or validation. The use of multiple chained string replacements before execution further obfuscates the payload, making static analysis difficult. Such obfuscation combined with immediate execution is a hallmark of malware, often used to deliver and run hidden payloads, potentially for data exfiltration, remote code execution, or system compromise. Given the extensive obfuscation, lack of transparency, and direct execution of decoded data, this code should be considered malicious."
