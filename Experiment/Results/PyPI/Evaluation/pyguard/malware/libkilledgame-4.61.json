      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window style), which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or to stage payloads. The use of subprocess to run PowerShell with encoded commands, combined with the lack of user interaction or notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests this is not legitimate code. The rest of the code is a setup call for a package with a suspicious name 'libkilledgame' and author 'EsqueleSquad', which may be a disguise or part of a supply chain attack. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and conditional execution, all hallmark signs of malware."
