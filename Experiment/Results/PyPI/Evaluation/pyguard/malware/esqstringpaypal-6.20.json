      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, as indicated by the suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the obfuscated PowerShell command. Additionally, the setup() call with a suspicious package name ('esqstringpaypal') and author email ('tahgoficial@proton.me') further supports the likelihood of a supply chain attack or malicious package installation. The combination of obfuscated command execution during package setup, hidden process spawning, and lack of legitimate user interaction or business logic is a hallmark of malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
