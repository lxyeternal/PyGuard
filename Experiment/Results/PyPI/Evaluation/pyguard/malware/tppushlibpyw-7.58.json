      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated runs. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (\"https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0\") and attempts to invoke a web request or download, which is a typical behavior of malware that downloads and executes a payload from a remote server. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information ('EsqueleSquad') and an email address that does not correspond to a known legitimate source. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process creation, and remote URL referencing strongly indicates malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware installation during package setup."
