      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports the 'fernet' module (installed via pip at runtime), then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large base64-encoded payload, and immediately executes the decrypted code with exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing obfuscated code is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The absence of any user interaction, the use of dynamic code execution on decrypted data, and the obfuscation through encryption and base64 encoding align with known malware behaviors such as payload delivery, evasion, and remote code execution. Given the extremely large encrypted payload and direct execution, this code is almost certainly designed to hide and run malicious operations."
