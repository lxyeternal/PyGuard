      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or staging technique. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide the window further indicates stealthy execution. Additionally, the setup() call with a suspicious package name 'libcontrolinfomine' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appears to be a cover for malicious activity, possibly a supply chain attack vector. The overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell command execution, stealth execution, no user consent, and execution triggered during package setup. These are hallmark behaviors of malware designed to execute hidden payloads, potentially for persistence, privilege escalation, or further payload delivery."
