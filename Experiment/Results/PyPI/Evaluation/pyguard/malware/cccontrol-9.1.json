      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for evasion and to execute arbitrary or malicious payloads without user awareness. The base64-encoded command likely contains a PowerShell script that performs further malicious actions, such as downloading or executing additional payloads, persistence, or system compromise. The code is embedded in a setup script, which means the malicious payload is executed automatically during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation without user consent."
