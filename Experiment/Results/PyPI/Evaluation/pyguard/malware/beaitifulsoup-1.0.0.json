      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a byte string and decrypted at runtime with a hardcoded key. This pattern of decrypting and immediately executing code during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscated class names, the suspicious package name 'BeaitifulSoup' (a typo-squatted variant of the popular 'BeautifulSoup' package), and the execution of hidden payloads during install are hallmark signs of a supply chain attack or malware. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks but instead runs concealed code, which could perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, persistence, or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
