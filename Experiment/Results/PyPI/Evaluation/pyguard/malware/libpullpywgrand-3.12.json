      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the use of a non-standard package name ('libpullpywgrand') with an author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further indicate malicious intent. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or data exfiltration. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, which is a known stealth technique. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated code execution, stealthy process spawning, and potential supply chain attack behavior during package setup."
