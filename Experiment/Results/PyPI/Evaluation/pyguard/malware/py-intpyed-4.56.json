      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and CREATE_NO_WINDOW creation flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the embedded URL-like string in the comment and the encoded command itself. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to execute obfuscated payloads silently during package installation or execution. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious package name ('py-intpyed'), author email, and the try/except blocks suppressing errors further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The code does not perform any legitimate user interaction or notification before executing the hidden PowerShell command, which is a hallmark of malicious activity."
