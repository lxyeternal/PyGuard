      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command string. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with silent execution in the background during package setup, is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears legitimate but is used here as a cover to execute the malicious payload during installation. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and remote code execution in Python packages."
