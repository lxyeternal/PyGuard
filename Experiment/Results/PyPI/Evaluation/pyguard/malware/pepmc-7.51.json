      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command, combined with hidden execution, is a classic malware technique to evade detection and execute potentially harmful payloads. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute automatically during package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The package name 'pepmc' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' do not correspond to any known legitimate package, increasing suspicion. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is overshadowed by the covert execution of the encoded PowerShell command. Therefore, this code is malicious."
