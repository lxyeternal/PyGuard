      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware to evade detection. The base64-encoded command likely contains a PowerShell script that performs unauthorized or malicious actions, such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise. This behavior occurs automatically during the execution of the script, without user interaction or notification, and is embedded alongside a seemingly benign setup() call, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks to hide malicious payloads within package installation scripts. The presence of obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and conditional execution based on file system state are strong indicators of malicious intent."
