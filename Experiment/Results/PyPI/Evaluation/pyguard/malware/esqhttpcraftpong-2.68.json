      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated runs. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands strongly indicate an attempt to execute hidden or potentially harmful payloads. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. These factors combined align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated code execution, stealthy process spawning, and potential remote code execution. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
