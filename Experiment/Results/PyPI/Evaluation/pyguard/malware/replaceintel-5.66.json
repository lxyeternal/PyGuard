      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to avoid user visibility, which is a typical stealth technique. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution during the setup phase of a Python package strongly suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the hidden execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."
