      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a typical evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name ('tppepultra') and author email further support malicious intent. The code executes this payload automatically during the setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate reason for such obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution in a setup script, and no user consent or interaction is required. Therefore, this code is malicious."
