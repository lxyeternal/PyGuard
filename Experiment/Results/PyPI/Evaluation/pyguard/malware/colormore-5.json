      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive user data related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet by accessing multiple wallet-related files and configuration files from the user's AppData roaming directory and desktop/downloads/documents folders. It then compresses these files into a ZIP archive without user consent. The script gathers the current username and external IP address, constructs a message including a country flag emoji derived from the IP's country code, and sends both the message and the ZIP archive to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID via HTTP POST requests. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive wallet credentials and passphrases to an attacker-controlled Telegram channel. The code operates silently without user interaction or notification, deletes the ZIP archive after sending to cover tracks, and uses hardcoded attacker-controlled endpoints. These are classic hallmarks of credential-stealing malware designed to harvest cryptocurrency wallet data and exfiltrate it covertly."
