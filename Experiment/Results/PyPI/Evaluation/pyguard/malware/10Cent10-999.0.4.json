      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute malicious behavior during package installation. Specifically, it creates a TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (104.248.19.57) on port 3333, then redirects the standard input, output, and error file descriptors to this socket. It subsequently spawns a new interactive shell (/bin/sh) connected to this socket, effectively creating a reverse shell. This allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine without user consent or notification. Executing such code during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and system compromise. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled IP, network connection, and spawning of a shell in the install hook is a definitive indicator of malicious intent."
