      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive user data related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet by accessing multiple wallet-related files and configuration files from the user's AppData roaming directory and other common user folders (Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It then compresses these files into a ZIP archive named with the username and a suspicious pattern. The script gathers the victim's username and external IP address via HTTP requests to ip-api.com, constructs a message including a country flag emoji derived from the country code, and sends both the message and the ZIP archive to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID via Telegram's bot API. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration of sensitive wallet credentials and configuration files without user consent or notification. The use of hardcoded attacker-controlled Telegram bot credentials, the targeting of wallet files, and the network transmission of these files to an external server are classic hallmarks of credential-stealing malware. There is no legitimate user interaction or business logic justifying this behavior, and the code attempts to clean up by deleting the ZIP archive after sending. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to steal cryptocurrency wallet data and exfiltrate it to an attacker-controlled Telegram channel."
