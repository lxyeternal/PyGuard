      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a typical stealth technique. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently during the setup phase (package installation) is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious payload delivery. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask errors and avoid raising suspicion. There is no legitimate reason for executing an obfuscated PowerShell command in a setup script, and the behavior matches known malicious patterns such as stealth execution, obfuscation, and unauthorized code execution during package installation."
