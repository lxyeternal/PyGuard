      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before launching the PowerShell process suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the package name 'esqrandomhydrainfo' with author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and potentially linked to malicious actors. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window is a known stealth technique. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates malicious behavior."
