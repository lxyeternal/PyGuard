      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, hiding its true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or ensure single execution. The presence of a suspicious URL in a comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name 'esqpushhttpad' authored by 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raise suspicion. The subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, suppressing any visible window, which is typical for malware to avoid user awareness. The code runs this potentially malicious payload during the setup process, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during package installation without user consent. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, suspicious naming, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
