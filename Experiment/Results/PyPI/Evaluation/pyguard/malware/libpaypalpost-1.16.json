      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to execute hidden, potentially malicious PowerShell commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation and stealth execution. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The presence of a suspicious author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) and a suspicious package name 'libpaypalpost' with an unrelated description further raises suspicion. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, enhancing stealth. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and potential payload delivery during package setup or installation. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
