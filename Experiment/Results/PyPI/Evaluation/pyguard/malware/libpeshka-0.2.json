It writes this file to the user's home directory with a hidden or obscure filename ('.drv'), sets the file as executable, and then modifies the user's .bashrc to execute this file in the background on shell startup. This sequence of network retrieval, writing an executable payload, setting execution permissions, and establishing persistence via .bashrc modification is a classic malware behavior pattern. There is no validation or user notification, and the code only runs on Linux systems, silently installing a potentially malicious payload that will execute on every new shell session. These actions align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including remote code download and execution, persistence establishment, and lack of legitimate business logic or user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a binary file from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://145.249.104.71/out) without any user consent or validation. It writes this file named '.drv' into the user's home directory, sets its executable permission, and modifies the user's .bashrc file to execute this file in the background on every shell startup. This behavior is a classic persistence mechanism used by malware to maintain foothold on a system. The code runs automatically during package installation (via the call to rn() at the top level and the setuptools entry point), which is a known supply chain attack vector. The lack of any legitimate business logic, user interaction, or notification, combined with network retrieval of an executable and automatic execution, strongly indicates malicious intent."
