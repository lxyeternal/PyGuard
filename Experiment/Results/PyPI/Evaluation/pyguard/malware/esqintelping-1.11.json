      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This obfuscation technique (base64-encoded PowerShell command) is a classic hallmark of malware attempting to hide its true intent. The command is executed silently (hidden window, CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag) without user interaction or notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name 'esqintelping' authored by 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raise suspicion. The setup() call appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except that suppresses errors, which may be an attempt to hide failures. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, and lack of legitimate user interaction or business logic strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks or malware payload delivery during package installation."
