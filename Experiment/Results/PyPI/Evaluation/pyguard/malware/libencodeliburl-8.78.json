      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) that is executed without user interaction or notification. The command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW) and encoded PowerShell command is a well-known technique for stealthy execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information ('EsqueleSquad') and email ('tahgoficial@proton.me'), and the comment references a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip). The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during package setup strongly suggests this code is designed for malicious purposes, such as a supply chain attack or remote code execution during installation."
