      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to execute hidden, potentially harmful commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands, used to evade detection and hide intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this hidden PowerShell process, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated execution or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled identity. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call wrapped in a try-except block, which appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script, executed automatically during installation without user consent or interaction, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware."
