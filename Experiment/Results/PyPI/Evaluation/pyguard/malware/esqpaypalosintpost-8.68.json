      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a stealth technique to avoid repeated execution. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known method for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads, often used in malware for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further malicious payloads. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious comment with a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the package name 'esqpaypalosintpost' authored by 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggests an attempt to disguise malicious intent under a seemingly legitimate package setup. The setup() call itself appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except that suppresses errors, which is a common evasion technique. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window, conditional execution based on directory existence, and the context of a package setup script strongly indicates malicious intent."
