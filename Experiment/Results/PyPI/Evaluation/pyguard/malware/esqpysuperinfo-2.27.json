      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, a typical stealth technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the use of an obfuscated PowerShell command strongly indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is executed before it, during the import or installation phase, which is a known supply chain attack vector. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup is a hallmark of malware aiming for stealthy code execution and possible further payload delivery or system compromise."
