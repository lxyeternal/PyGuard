      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window, CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag), which is a well-known technique used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary code without user consent or notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) and a suspicious package name ('libcontrolramhacked') further supports malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and suspicious naming conventions strongly indicates this code is malicious."
