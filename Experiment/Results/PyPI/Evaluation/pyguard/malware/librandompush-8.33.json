      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known method for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. Additionally, the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a cover or delivery mechanism. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. Therefore, this code is strongly indicative of malicious intent."
