      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command appears to invoke a web request to a suspicious URL (\"https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0\") and outputs to a file named \"~\\/WindowsCache.exe\" followed by execution of that file. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell command execution, downloading an executable from a remote URL, saving it to a hidden location, and executing it is a classic malware behavior for payload delivery and execution. Additionally, the package name 'esqpaypalvirtualmc' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' along with the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The code runs this malicious payload automatically during the setup process without any user interaction or consent, which is typical of supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code is malicious."
