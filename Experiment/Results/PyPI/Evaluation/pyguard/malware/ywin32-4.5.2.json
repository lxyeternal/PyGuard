      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It hooks into the setuptools installation process to execute code automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. It collects the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' (host identifier) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-standard external domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is a classic data exfiltration technique. Furthermore, if the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable file from another suspicious URL (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it with a misleading .exe filename, and immediately executes it using a shell command. This sequence of network communication, file writing, and execution of a remote binary during installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery. The absence of any user notification, validation, or legitimate business logic, combined with the use of hardcoded suspicious URLs and automatic execution of downloaded code, confirms the code is malicious."
