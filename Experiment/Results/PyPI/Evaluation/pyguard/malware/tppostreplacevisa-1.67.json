      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (Base64 encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known method to obfuscate and stealthily execute potentially harmful commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded command likely downloads or executes further payloads or performs unauthorized actions. Additionally, the package metadata contains suspicious author information and a suspicious package name, which may be used for supply chain attacks. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and potential remote code execution during package installation."
