      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, as indicated by the suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated PowerShell command. This pattern—obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup—is a well-known hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or payload delivery. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script but contains this hidden malicious payload execution, consistent with supply chain attacks or malicious PyPI packages."
