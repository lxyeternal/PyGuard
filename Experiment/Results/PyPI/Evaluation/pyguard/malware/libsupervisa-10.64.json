      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, a common stealth technique. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely performs actions without user consent or notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which may be a persistence or evasion mechanism. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during the setup process, combined with the suspicious author email and package name, strongly suggests this is a supply chain attack or malware embedded in a Python package installation script. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package setup, all of which are hallmark behaviors of malicious code."
