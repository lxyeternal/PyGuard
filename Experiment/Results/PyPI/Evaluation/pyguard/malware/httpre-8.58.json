      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The Base64-encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and outputs it as a Windows cache executable, then invokes it. This behavior is a classic indicator of malware: obfuscated code execution, downloading and running a remote executable without user consent, and running in hidden mode to evade detection. Additionally, this code is placed in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. The package name and author email appear suspicious and do not correspond to known legitimate packages. The use of try/except to silently suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent."
