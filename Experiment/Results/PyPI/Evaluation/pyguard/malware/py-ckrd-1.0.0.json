      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary decrypted code during package installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). Specifically, it imports the 'fernet' module and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large base64-encoded payload, which is then executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated encrypted payloads executed during installation is a strong indicator of malware, as it enables remote code execution and payload delivery stealthily. Additionally, the package name and metadata appear suspicious and obfuscated, further supporting malicious intent."
