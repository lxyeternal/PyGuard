      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, a common stealth technique. The base64-encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to a suspicious URL (\"https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm...\"), downloading and executing a file named 'WindowsCache.exe'. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and executes a payload without user consent or notification. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. The package name and author information appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate software. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, downloading and executing a remote payload, and execution during package installation strongly confirms malicious intent."
