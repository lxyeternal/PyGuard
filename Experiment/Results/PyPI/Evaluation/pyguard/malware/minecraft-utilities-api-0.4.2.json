      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware. It systematically searches for and accesses sensitive user data from multiple installed applications, including Discord and various Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, OperaGX). The code extracts authentication tokens, browser cookies, and saved passwords by decrypting encrypted data using Windows APIs (win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData) and AES decryption. It writes this sensitive information into local text files named with the current user's login. Subsequently, it attempts to exfiltrate these files to attacker-controlled endpoints via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL and optionally a Telegram bot token and chat ID (placeholders are present but the Discord webhook is active). The code performs these actions silently without user consent or notification, deletes local copies after exfiltration, and uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 decoding and encrypted key handling to evade detection. The combination of environment variable usage to locate sensitive directories, decryption of protected credentials, automated data collection, and network exfiltration to hardcoded external servers is a hallmark of malicious information-stealing malware. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to steal and leak user credentials and tokens."
