      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed during the setup script execution is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading and executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command and the execution of this command during package setup (installation) strongly suggests a supply chain attack vector. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') along with the suspicious comment and domain ('www.esquelesquad.rip') further support the malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands on the victim's machine during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
