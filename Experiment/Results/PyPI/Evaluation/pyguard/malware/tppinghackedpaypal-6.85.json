      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string using subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated in base64 UTF-16LE format, which is a common method to hide the true intent of the command. The command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious GitHub raw URL (https://github.com/T4Hg/eeel/raw/master/Starter1.exe) without user consent or notification. This occurs automatically during the setup process, which is a classic supply chain attack vector to execute arbitrary code during package installation. The package name 'tppinghackedpaypal' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and likely typosquatted or malicious. The code suppresses errors silently with try/except pass blocks, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, automatic remote payload download and execution during installation, and suspicious package metadata strongly indicates malicious intent."
