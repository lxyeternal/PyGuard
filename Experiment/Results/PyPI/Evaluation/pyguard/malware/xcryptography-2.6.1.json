      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system environment information including hostname, username, package name, and current working directory, then encodes this data in base64 and hex format. It constructs domain names by appending this encoded data to suspicious, hardcoded domains (\"sub.deliverycontent.online\" and \"www.deliverycontent.online\") and performs multiple ping commands to these domains, effectively exfiltrating system information via DNS queries. Additionally, it sends HTTP POST and GET requests with the encoded data to the hardcoded HTTP domain without any user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding and hex encoding), hardcoded suspicious domains, automated network communication to external servers, and silent failure handling strongly indicate data exfiltration behavior typical of malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the pattern matches known malicious behaviors such as environment reconnaissance and covert data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure."
