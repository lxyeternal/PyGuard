      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally based on the absence of a directory named 'tahg' suggests stealthy, potentially unauthorized activity. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs actions such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads from a suspicious URL (notably referencing 'dl.dropbox.com' and 'esquelesquad.rip'), which is a common pattern in malware for downloading and executing additional malicious code. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and external suspicious URLs combined with execution during package setup strongly aligns with known supply chain attack techniques and malware behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."
