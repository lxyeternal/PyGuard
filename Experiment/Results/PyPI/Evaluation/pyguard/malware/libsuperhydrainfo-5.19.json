      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (# www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated command string. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware that execute code during installation without user consent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears legitimate but is used here as a cover to execute the malicious payload. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Therefore, this code is malicious."
