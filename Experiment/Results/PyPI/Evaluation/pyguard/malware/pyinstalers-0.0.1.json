      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically using exec and compile, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload imports modules for temporary file handling, system execution, and URL opening, then downloads and executes code from suspicious hardcoded URLs (http://20.226.18.203/grab/ry2K1CIVRSFa59vT and http://20.226.18.203/clip). This behavior includes fetching remote code without user consent, executing it immediately, and performing network communication to attacker-controlled IP addresses. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic execution, and remote code retrieval combined with no user interaction or validation strongly indicates this is malicious code designed for remote code execution and potential data exfiltration or system compromise."
