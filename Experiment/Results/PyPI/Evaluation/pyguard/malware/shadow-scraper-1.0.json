      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious Discord token stealer and credential harvester. It collects sensitive data such as Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords, billing information, friend lists, owned servers, gift codes, and user environment details from various browsers and Discord clients on the victim's machine. It decrypts encrypted data using Windows APIs and AES decryption with the local master key. The stolen data is exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without user consent. The code also searches user directories for files containing keywords related to passwords, wallets, and tokens, uploads these files to anonymous file hosting services, and sends links to the attacker. It uses threading to perform these actions stealthily and suppresses errors to evade detection. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URLs, environment variable access to sensitive paths, decryption of protected data, automated data exfiltration, and lack of user interaction are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is executed automatically during package setup, which is a known supply chain attack vector. All these behaviors confirm that this code is malicious and designed for credential theft and data exfiltration."
