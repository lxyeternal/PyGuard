      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command, which is executed without user interaction or notification. The command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. This pattern of spawning a hidden PowerShell process with base64-encoded commands is a well-known hallmark of malware, often used for executing payloads, persistence, or downloading and running further malicious code. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears benign but is used here as a cover or delivery mechanism. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
