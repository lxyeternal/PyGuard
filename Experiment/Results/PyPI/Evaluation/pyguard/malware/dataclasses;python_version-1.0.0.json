      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/284099f8-6eea-45be-9c3c-3b6b0f9ccb0e), which is an attacker-controlled endpoint. This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The code executes automatically during installation, lacks any legitimate business logic or user notification, and contacts an external server to leak system information. These factors strongly indicate malicious intent."
