      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command, the use of subprocess to execute it stealthily, and the check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution) are classic signs of malware attempting to execute obfuscated payloads. Additionally, the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the suspicious package name 'esqhttpLGTB' authored by 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggest malicious intent. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious code. Overall, this pattern matches known malware behaviors involving obfuscated code execution during package installation or execution, stealthy PowerShell invocation, and potential payload delivery or system compromise."
