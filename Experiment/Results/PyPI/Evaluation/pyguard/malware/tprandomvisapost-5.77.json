      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The command is obfuscated via base64 encoding, which is a common technique to hide malicious intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a typical evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The use of subprocess to execute obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup or installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling stealthy execution of potentially harmful code on the victim's system. There is no legitimate user interaction or business logic justifying this behavior, and the rest of the setup code appears to be a decoy or cover. Therefore, this code is malicious."
