      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a conditional payload execution to evade repeated detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further supports malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution during installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and potential further payload delivery or system compromise. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, lack of user consent, and execution during package installation."
