      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (Base64 encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), which is a known vector for malware delivery. This pattern of obfuscated, encoded command execution via PowerShell in a setup script is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The use of distutils setup with embedded malicious code that executes on installation further confirms the malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for such obfuscated, hidden, remote code execution in a package setup script."
