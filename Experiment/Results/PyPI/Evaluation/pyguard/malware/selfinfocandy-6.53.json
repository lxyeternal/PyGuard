      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the obfuscated command and the suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip). This execution happens automatically during the package setup phase without any user interaction or consent, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The presence of obfuscation, hidden execution, and the use of PowerShell encoded commands in a setup script strongly indicates malicious intent."
