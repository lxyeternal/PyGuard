      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string. The command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell code, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW, indicating stealth execution without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or unwanted runs. This behavior is typical of malware that executes hidden payloads or downloads further malicious components. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with stealth process creation and lack of user interaction strongly indicates malicious intent."
