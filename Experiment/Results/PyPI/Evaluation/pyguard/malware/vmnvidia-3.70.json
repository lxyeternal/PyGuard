      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The Base64-encoded PowerShell command likely contains obfuscated instructions that are executed without user interaction or notification. This behavior is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it uses obfuscation to hide the true nature of the command and runs it silently in the background. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package setup."
