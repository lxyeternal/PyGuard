      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' suppresses any visible window, which is a stealth technique. This behavior is executed automatically during the import or execution of this script, without any user interaction or notification. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during setup or import is a classic supply chain attack pattern. Given the obfuscation, stealth execution, and lack of legitimate context, this code exhibits strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with malware that executes hidden payloads during package installation or execution."
