      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence mechanism. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further indicate suspicious origins. The use of distutils setup with a suspicious package name 'esqposthttpstudy' and the inclusion of this hidden PowerShell execution during setup strongly suggests a supply chain attack vector. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy subprocess spawning, and suspicious metadata is a strong indicator of malicious behavior."
