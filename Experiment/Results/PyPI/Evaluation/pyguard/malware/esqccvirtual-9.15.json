      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized or harmful actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the suspicious URL comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the obfuscated command string. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is used here as a cover for executing malicious code during installation. There is no user interaction or notification before the hidden execution, and the use of obfuscation and hidden process creation strongly indicates malicious intent."
