      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description strings further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The code executes arbitrary code during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The use of 'exec' on decrypted data, the import of network modules, and the execution triggered automatically on install are all strong indicators of malicious intent."
