      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command, combined with silent execution in the background without user interaction or notification, is a classic malware technique to evade detection and execute potentially harmful payloads. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The package name 'urlpyw' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' do not correspond to known legitimate packages, increasing suspicion. The rest of the setup call appears normal but is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, which can be used to hide malicious activity. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
