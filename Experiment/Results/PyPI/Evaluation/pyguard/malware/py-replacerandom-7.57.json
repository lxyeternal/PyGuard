      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This obfuscation technique (base64-encoded PowerShell command) is a well-known method to hide the true intent of the command and evade detection. The command is executed in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden) and with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible console window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is triggered automatically during import or execution, without user interaction or consent. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector where malicious code is embedded in a package's setup or installation script to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. Therefore, this code is malicious."
