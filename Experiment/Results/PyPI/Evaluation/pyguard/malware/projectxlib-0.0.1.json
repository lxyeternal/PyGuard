      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential-stealing malware targeting Discord and various browsers. It performs multiple malicious actions including: 1) Environment checks to avoid execution on blacklisted usernames, hostnames, and MAC addresses. 2) Killing running Discord processes to interfere with normal operation. 3) Injecting malicious JavaScript code into Discord client files to capture user data and send it to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. 4) Extracting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data by accessing local files, decrypting them using Windows APIs, and collecting user environment information. 5) Uploading stolen data to anonymous file hosting services and exfiltrating detailed user information (tokens, billing info, friends list, badges) to attacker-controlled Discord webhooks. 6) Persisting itself by copying the script to the Windows startup folder for automatic execution. 7) Running a Flask web server exposing API endpoints that allow remote attackers to interact with stolen tokens, perform Discord account takeover actions (password change, 2FA removal), and send stolen data to attacker webhooks. 8) Using obfuscated variable names and multiple threads to evade detection and perform concurrent data theft and exfiltration. 9) Downloading and executing remote code (JavaScript injection) from a GitHub URL without user consent. 10) No user interaction or consent is required; all actions are performed silently in the background. These behaviors align with known malware patterns such as credential theft, data exfiltration, persistence, and remote control, confirming the code is malicious."
