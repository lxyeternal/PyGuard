      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the obfuscated base64 string and the commented suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip). This behavior is typical of malware that executes hidden payloads during package installation or runtime without user consent. Additionally, the package name 'py-vmkillencode' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and do not correspond to known legitimate packages. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates malicious intent."
