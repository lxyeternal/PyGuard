      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in supply chain attacks. The code executes arbitrary, obfuscated code without user consent or interaction during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, persistence, or data exfiltration. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and execution during the install phase strongly indicates malicious intent. Furthermore, the package setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only to facilitate this hidden payload execution. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and abuse of setuptools install hooks for stealthy payload delivery."
