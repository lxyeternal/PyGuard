      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and compression (base64, zlib) combined with dynamic execution functions such as eval and exec. It contains a large encoded string that is decompressed and decoded at runtime, then executed dynamically. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true payload and behavior from static analysis. The code imports modules commonly used in malware (requests, socket, os), and the obfuscation prevents easy understanding of its actions. The use of eval on decompressed and decoded data is a classic technique for executing hidden or downloaded malicious payloads. The code also references suspicious URLs and uses lambda functions with confusing variable names to evade detection. These characteristics align with known malware behaviors such as remote code execution, payload delivery, and evasion. Therefore, this code is malicious."
