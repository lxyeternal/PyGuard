      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, a common stealth technique. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the obfuscated encoded command and the commented suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip). This execution happens automatically during the import or setup phase without any user interaction or consent. Additionally, the package name 'tppushcpucandy' and author information appear suspicious and unrelated to the described functionality, which is a common trait in malicious packages. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates malicious intent."
