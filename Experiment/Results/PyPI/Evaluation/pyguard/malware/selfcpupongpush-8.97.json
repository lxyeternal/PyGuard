      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally based on the absence of a directory named 'tahg' suggests stealthy execution of potentially harmful code. The comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further indicate malicious intent. This pattern of obfuscation, hidden execution, and use of encoded PowerShell commands is a well-known hallmark of malware, often used for payload delivery, persistence, or further exploitation. The setup() call appears benign but is likely a cover or part of a supply chain attack vector. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious activity."
