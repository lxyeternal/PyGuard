      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as this technique is commonly used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with spawning PowerShell in hidden mode is a hallmark of malware. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script but contains this hidden malicious payload execution, consistent with supply chain attack patterns. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
