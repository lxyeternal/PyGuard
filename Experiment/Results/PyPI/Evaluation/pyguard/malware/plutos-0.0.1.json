      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads two executable files from hardcoded, external Discord CDN URLs and saves them to a suspicious system directory (C:\\$Windows.~SXK) without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately executes these downloaded executables using os.startfile, which can run arbitrary code on the system. The directory used is unusual and likely intended to hide the files. After execution, it attempts to delete the directory, possibly to cover tracks. This pattern of downloading and executing untrusted binaries from remote URLs, especially during package setup or installation, is a classic hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. The code also suppresses errors silently, which is typical for malicious code trying to evade detection. The presence of network retrieval, file writing to system-like hidden folders, and immediate execution of unknown executables without validation or user consent strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a folder disguised as a Windows system folder (C:\\$Windows.~SXK), downloads an executable file from a hardcoded external URL (a Discord CDN link), saves it into that folder with a suspicious name (XMICNEI.exe), and immediately executes it without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic pattern of malware that downloads and runs a potentially untrusted payload silently. The use of a disguised folder name to evade casual detection, the direct network retrieval of an executable, and the immediate execution of that executable are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or validation of the downloaded content, which further confirms the malicious nature of this code."
