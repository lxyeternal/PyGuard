      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is executed with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, further indicating stealth behavior. Additionally, the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest suspicious or attacker-controlled identifiers. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during the setup phase is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent or interaction. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and lack of user notification. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
