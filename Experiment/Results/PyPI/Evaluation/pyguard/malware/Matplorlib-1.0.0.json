      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec(). The decryption key and encrypted payload are hardcoded and obfuscated using Fernet symmetric encryption. This decrypted code is executed immediately during the package installation process without user interaction or consent. The package name 'Matplorlib' is a typo-squatted variant of the legitimate 'matplotlib' package, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks to trick users into installing malicious packages. Executing arbitrary decrypted code during installation is a classic supply chain attack vector that enables remote code execution, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further payload delivery. The obfuscation of the payload and the execution of code at install time strongly indicate malicious intent."
