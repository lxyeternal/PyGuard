      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads from a suspicious URL (notably the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip). This pattern of obfuscated command execution via PowerShell in a setup script is a classic hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks that execute malicious code during package installation. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script but contains this hidden payload execution, confirming malicious intent."
