      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command, the check for a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution), and the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) strongly suggest stealthy, unauthorized execution. This pattern is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads, which is a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, enabling code execution during package installation. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during setup confirms the code is malicious."
