      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that execute the function 'notmalfunc' during package installation or development setup. This function collects all environment variables from the host system, encodes them as URL parameters, and prepares an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL ('https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app'). Although the request is constructed, it is not explicitly sent in the provided snippet, but the intent to exfiltrate environment data is clear. The environment variables can contain sensitive information such as credentials, tokens, or system configuration. Executing this data collection and network communication automatically during package installation without user consent or notification is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The use of a non-standard, attacker-controlled domain (ngrok-free.app) further supports the malicious intent. This pattern aligns with known malicious behaviors involving environment data exfiltration during package installation, which is a critical risk indicator for malware."
