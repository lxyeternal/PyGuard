      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and a suspicious package name, then encodes this data in base64 and further hex-encodes it. It constructs domain names by appending this encoded data to a suspicious DNS domain ('.sub.deliverycontent.online') and performs multiple 'ping' shell commands to these domains, which is an unusual and covert method of data exfiltration via DNS queries. Additionally, the code sends HTTP POST and GET requests with the encoded data to a hardcoded suspicious domain ('www.deliverycontent.online') using multiple HTTP client libraries (urllib.request, requests, urllib), indicating attempts to exfiltrate collected information over the network. The entire process is automated, runs without user interaction or notification, and uses obfuscation techniques (base64 encoding and hex encoding) to hide the data being sent. These behaviors—silent collection of environment and user information, obfuscated encoding, and exfiltration to attacker-controlled domains—are classic hallmarks of malicious code designed for information theft and covert communication with a command-and-control server."
