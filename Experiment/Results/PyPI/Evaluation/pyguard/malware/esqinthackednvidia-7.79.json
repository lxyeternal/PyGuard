      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a known stealth technique. The presence of a suspicious hardcoded URL in the commented line (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the package name 'esqinthackednvidia' further suggest malicious intent or at least a suspicious origin. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of arbitrary code during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of try/except blocks to silently ignore errors also indicates an attempt to evade detection or prevent interruption. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, conditional execution based on file system state, and embedding in a package setup script strongly indicates malicious behavior."
