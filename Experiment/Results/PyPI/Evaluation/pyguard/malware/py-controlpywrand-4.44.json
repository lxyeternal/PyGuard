      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of the check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence mechanism. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information ('EsqueleSquad') and an unusual package name ('py-controlpywrand'), which may be typosquatting or malicious. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process creation, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware payload delivery."
