      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command, the check for a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution), and the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) strongly suggest malicious intent. This pattern is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, often used for downloading or executing further payloads, privilege escalation, or persistence. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script but silently executes this hidden payload during installation or execution. These characteristics align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, hidden execution, and use of encoded PowerShell commands."
