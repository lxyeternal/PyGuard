      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window, no shell), which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The presence of a suspicious hardcoded URL in the commented line (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggest malicious intent. The use of subprocess to run obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup or import is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code (setup call) appears benign but is likely a cover or part of a malicious package installation process. Overall, the combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote command invocation strongly indicates malicious intent."
