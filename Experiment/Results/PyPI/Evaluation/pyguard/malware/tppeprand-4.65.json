      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, indicating stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely contains obfuscated instructions, which is a common malware technique to evade detection. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which may be used as a persistence or evasion mechanism. The presence of a suspicious comment with a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup call for a package with a suspicious name 'tppeprand' and author 'EsqueleSquad', which may be a typosquatted or malicious package. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup is a classic supply chain attack pattern and is strongly associated with malware."
