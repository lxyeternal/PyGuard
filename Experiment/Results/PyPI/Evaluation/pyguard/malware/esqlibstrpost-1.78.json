      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands, and the subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The comment '# www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled entity. The setup call appears benign superficially but is wrapped in a try/except pass block, which suppresses errors and may be used to hide malicious activity during package installation. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, the use of subprocess with hidden window flags, and the lack of any legitimate user interaction or notification strongly indicates malicious behavior."
