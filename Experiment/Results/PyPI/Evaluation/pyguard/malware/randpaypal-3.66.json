      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell is launched with the WindowStyle Hidden flag and CREATE_NO_WINDOW creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, a known stealth technique. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute obfuscated PowerShell commands in a hidden manner is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables execution of arbitrary, potentially harmful code without user knowledge or consent. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscated commands and stealth flags is a critical risk indicator of malware behavior."
