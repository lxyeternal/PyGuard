      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads, commonly used in malware for evasion, persistence, or payload delivery. The subprocess is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, further hiding the execution from the user. This behavior occurs automatically during the import or execution of this script, without any user interaction or notification, which is typical of malicious code. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask or blend the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Given these factors and the known risk indicators, this code contains malicious behavior."
