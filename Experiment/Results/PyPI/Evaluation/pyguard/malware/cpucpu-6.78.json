      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known method for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads, often used in malware for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further malicious code. This execution happens automatically during the setup script execution, without any user interaction or notification, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but is overshadowed by the hidden PowerShell execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
