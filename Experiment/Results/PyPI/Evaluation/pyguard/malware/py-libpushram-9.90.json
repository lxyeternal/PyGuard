      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The command references a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and attempts to execute a PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest command to download or interact with a remote resource, which is a common technique for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, or further compromise. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution during the setup process (package installation) is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script but silently triggers this hidden execution, which is a classic malicious pattern. Therefore, this code is malicious."
