      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally (only if the 'tahg' directory does not exist) suggests stealth and evasion. This pattern—executing obfuscated PowerShell commands in hidden mode during package setup—is a well-known technique used in malware for stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is used here as a cover or delivery mechanism. Given these factors and the knowledge points about obfuscated PowerShell execution during install, this code is malicious."
