      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of base64 decoding, eval, and exec calls to dynamically decode and execute code at runtime. It imports modules in an obfuscated manner and decodes large base64-encoded payloads which are then executed. The code uses eval and compile on decoded data, a hallmark of malicious behavior. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly indicate an attempt to hide malicious payloads or actions. The code also appears to perform environment discovery and likely exfiltrates or manipulates sensitive data without user interaction or consent. Such patterns are consistent with credential stealing, remote code execution, or supply chain attack malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
