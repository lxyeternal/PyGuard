      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a comprehensive malware sample known as EvilPIP. It performs extensive malicious activities including: 1) Stealing sensitive user data such as WiFi passwords, Chrome saved passwords, Chrome cookies, and Discord tokens by accessing system files, decrypting protected data using Windows APIs and cryptographic libraries, and collecting environment and system information. 2) Exfiltrating all collected data by uploading it to external servers (e.g., gofile.io) and sending detailed reports to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, enabling remote attackers to receive stolen credentials and system info without user consent. 3) Implementing a reverse shell capability that can connect back to an attacker-controlled server IP and port, allowing remote command execution on the victim machine. 4) Using obfuscation techniques such as randomized file names, encrypted Chrome keys, and encoded network communication to evade detection. 5) Running all these operations silently without user interaction or notification, and potentially maintaining persistence. The code leverages Windows-specific APIs and commands to extract credentials and system details, then automatically sends this data to attacker-controlled endpoints. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including credential theft, data exfiltration, remote access trojans (RAT), and stealthy operation. Therefore, this code is definitively malicious."
