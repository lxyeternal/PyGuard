      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the use of a hidden PowerShell window strongly indicate stealthy, potentially malicious behavior. Additionally, the package metadata references a suspicious author and email, and the overall pattern matches known supply chain attack vectors where malicious code is executed during package setup or installation. These factors combined confirm that the code exhibits malicious behavior."
