      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded Fernet key. This pattern of decrypting and immediately executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated, encrypted payloads executed at install time without user interaction or consent strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the package name and metadata appear random and meaningless, which is typical of malicious or typosquatted packages. The code also requires 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup dependencies, which are commonly used in malware for network communication and cryptographic operations. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated payload execution during installation, use of encryption to hide payloads, and execution of arbitrary code without user consent."
