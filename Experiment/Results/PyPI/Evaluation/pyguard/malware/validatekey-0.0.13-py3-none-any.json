      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive user data, specifically Roblox authentication cookies from multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Brave) using the browser_cookie3 library without user consent. It also gathers system information such as the hostname, IP address, and username. This data is then written to a file in a hidden directory under the user's Documents folder and exfiltrated automatically every 3 hours via a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The behavior is fully automated, runs silently in the background without user interaction or notification, and targets sensitive authentication tokens that can be used for account hijacking. The use of a hardcoded external webhook for data exfiltration, combined with stealthy data collection from multiple browsers, strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with credential-stealing malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious token grabber designed to stealthily collect sensitive user data and exfiltrate it to an attacker-controlled Discord webhook. It performs the following malicious actions: 1) Collects Discord authentication tokens from multiple Discord client variants and Chromium-based browsers by scanning local storage files. 2) Decrypts stored Chrome passwords and cookies using the system's master key, accessing sensitive credentials without user consent. 3) Takes a screenshot of the victim's desktop. 4) Gathers system and network information such as IP address, city, country, and region via an external API. 5) Packages all collected data into a zip archive stored in a temporary folder. 6) Sends the collected data and system information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, enabling remote attackers to receive stolen credentials and environment details. 7) Attempts to kill running Discord processes and injects malicious code into Discord's core files to maintain persistence or further compromise. 8) Modifies BetterDiscord files to bypass protections. 9) Automatically restarts Discord to load the injected malicious code. The code operates without any user interaction or notification, uses hardcoded attacker-controlled endpoints, and leverages system APIs to decrypt and steal credentials. These behaviors align with typical characteristics of credential-stealing malware and data exfiltration tools, confirming its malicious intent."
