      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or staging technique. The hardcoded comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the suspicious package metadata (author 'EsqueleSquad', suspicious package name 'esqstringcandypost') further indicate malicious intent. The use of distutils setup with try/except blocks to suppress errors and the execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector. Overall, the code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth execution, and potential for remote code execution or payload delivery."
