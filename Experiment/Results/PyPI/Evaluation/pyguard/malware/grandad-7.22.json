      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware to evade detection. The base64-encoded command likely contains a malicious payload or instructions, but even without decoding, the pattern of hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, this execution occurs at import time (immediately when the script runs), without user interaction or notification, which is typical for malware attempting to execute payloads silently. The rest of the code is a standard-looking setup() call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious behavior within a seemingly benign package installation script. This pattern aligns with supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior."
