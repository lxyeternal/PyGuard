      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware. It collects sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords, billing information, and user environment details (IP, username, hardware IDs). It decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows APIs and AES decryption, then exfiltrates this information to a hardcoded attacker-controlled Discord webhook URL. The code also injects malicious JavaScript into Discord client files to further capture data. It uses threading to stealthily gather and upload data, zips user wallet, gaming, and app data, and uploads these archives to anonymous file hosting services. The script ensures persistence by copying itself to the Windows startup folder. It performs environment checks to avoid running on blacklisted users or machines. The presence of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded suspicious URLs, and automated data exfiltration without user consent confirms its malicious intent. This code is a comprehensive information stealer targeting Discord and browser credentials, designed to operate covertly and persistently."
