      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently is a classic technique for stealthy code execution, often used for downloading or executing further malicious payloads, privilege escalation, or persistence. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script for a package named 'py-intelinfo' authored by 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which is suspicious and likely a cover for the malicious payload. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during package setup strongly indicates this is a supply chain attack or malware embedded in a Python package installation script."
