      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, during installation, reads the entire environment variables from the sensitive system file '/proc/self/environ'. It then base64-encodes this sensitive environment data and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, attacker-controlled external domain (kh5pv9zea8s3kekv8cyubzze95fw3urj.oastify.com). This behavior constitutes automated, silent exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information without user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being sent, combined with the execution of this code during package installation (a known supply chain attack vector), and the contact with a suspicious external server, are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the fallback request in the except block attempts to notify the same external server if the environment file is not accessible, further confirming the intent to communicate with the attacker-controlled endpoint. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this behavior, making it a clear case of malicious code designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate environment data during package installation."
