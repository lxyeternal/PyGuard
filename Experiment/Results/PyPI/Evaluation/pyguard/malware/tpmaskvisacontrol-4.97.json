      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string passed via the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell code, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The PowerShell command is executed with the window style set to hidden, suppressing any visible window, which is typical for stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, likely as a persistence or evasion mechanism. The presence of a suspicious hardcoded URL in a comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggest malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious code during package installation without user consent. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy subprocess creation, and execution during package setup strongly indicates this code is malicious."
