      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, a typical stealth technique. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute obfuscated PowerShell commands in a hidden window without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious code during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears normal but is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, which may be used to hide failures in malicious code execution. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window triggered during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
