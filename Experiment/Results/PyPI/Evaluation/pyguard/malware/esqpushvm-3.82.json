      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification, and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide its execution. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution, potentially for downloading or running further malicious payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be a persistence or evasion mechanism. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks to execute malicious code during package installation. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is malicious."
