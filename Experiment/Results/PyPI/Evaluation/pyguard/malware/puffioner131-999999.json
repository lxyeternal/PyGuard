      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that, during package installation or development setup, automatically collect all environment variables from the host system and send them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://eewtrzyimp165no1u4kqfhv0nrtih95y.oastify.com). This behavior occurs silently without any user interaction or consent, constituting automated data exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment information. The use of a non-standard, attacker-controlled domain for data transmission during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification associated with this data collection and exfiltration, making this code a high-risk security threat."
