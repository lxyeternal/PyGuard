      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally based on the absence of a directory named 'tahg' suggests stealthy, unauthorized execution. Such use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands in hidden mode is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads, which is a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the package name 'hackedhydra' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and potentially typosquatted or attacker-controlled. The code is executed during the setup process, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The try/except blocks suppress errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious intent."
