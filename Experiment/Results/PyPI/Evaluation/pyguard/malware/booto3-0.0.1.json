      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a Python package setup script that hijacks the installation process by overriding setuptools install and egg_info commands to execute a function RunCommand(). This function collects sensitive system information by capturing all environment variables and the full process list (via 'ps -elf'). It then constructs a POST request using curl to send this collected data to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (http://catvghtugbisywnzzpwvtuhf7ifdcnw1u.oast.fun), which is attacker-controlled infrastructure. The data exfiltration occurs automatically during package installation without any user interaction or consent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including: execution of shell commands during install, collection of environment variables and process information, automated network exfiltration to a suspicious domain, and use of a non-legitimate, obfuscated URL. Such supply chain attack techniques are well-known vectors for malware delivery and data theft. Therefore, this code is malicious."
