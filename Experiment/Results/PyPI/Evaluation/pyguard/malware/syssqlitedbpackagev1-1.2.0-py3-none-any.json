      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: 1) It installs a large number of Python packages without user consent, including some commonly used in malware. 2) It copies the 'Cryptodome' package directory to 'Crypto', a known technique to bypass certain import issues but also used in malware for cryptographic operations. 3) It writes a Python script ('pl.py') containing an obfuscated payload that decrypts and executes a large base64-encoded encrypted string using the 'fernet' module, indicating hidden malicious code execution. 4) It launches this script in a hidden subprocess with no window, a stealth technique. 5) It downloads a Python script ('run.py') from a suspicious external URL ('https://kekwltd.ru/run.py') into the Windows startup folder, sets it hidden, and attempts to execute it, establishing persistence and remote code execution. 6) The use of environment variables to locate user-specific directories and writing executable scripts there without user interaction is typical of malware. 7) The entire flow lacks any legitimate user interaction or notification and involves obfuscated code execution and remote payload fetching, which are hallmark behaviors of malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
