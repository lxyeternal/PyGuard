      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The base64-encoded command is not decoded or inspected in the code, but the pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means the malicious payload executes automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious behavior. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy, obfuscated execution of potentially harmful commands during package installation."
