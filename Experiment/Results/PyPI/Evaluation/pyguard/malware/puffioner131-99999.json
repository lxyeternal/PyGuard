      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that automatically execute during package installation or development setup. In these commands, it collects all environment variables from the host system and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (http://eewtrzyimp165no1u4kqfhv0nrtih95y.oastify.com) without any user interaction, consent, or notification. This behavior constitutes automated, silent exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data, which may include credentials, tokens, or other private information. The use of a non-standard, attacker-controlled domain and the absence of any legitimate business logic or user prompt strongly indicate malicious intent. Such supply chain attack techniques are well-known vectors for malware to steal environment information during package installation, making this code a critical risk for malicious behavior."
