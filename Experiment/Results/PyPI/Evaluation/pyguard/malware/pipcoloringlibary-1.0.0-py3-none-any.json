      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware and information exfiltration tools. It collects extensive sensitive information from the victim's system, including Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords, credit card data, Roblox cookies, Minecraft and Roblox user data, system information (such as Windows product key, hardware UUID, IP geolocation), and screenshots. The code uses Windows APIs to decrypt stored credentials and browser data, accesses environment variables to locate user data directories, and copies these files to temporary directories. It then compresses the stolen data into archives and exfiltrates it to attacker-controlled endpoints via HTTP POST requests to hardcoded suspicious URLs (e.g., https://kekwltd.ru/relay/bluescreen). The code also includes clipboard monitoring and replacement functionality targeting cryptocurrency wallet addresses, replacing them with attacker-controlled addresses to hijack cryptocurrency transactions. It employs anti-debugging and anti-virtual machine checks to evade analysis and detection. The code runs stealthily without user interaction, installs dependencies silently, and attempts persistence by copying itself to the Windows startup folder. It kills processes related to Discord and debugging tools to avoid interference. The presence of obfuscated variable and function names, base64 decoding of encrypted keys, and direct network communication to suspicious domains further confirm its malicious intent. Overall, this code is a comprehensive information stealer and clipboard hijacker designed to silently harvest and exfiltrate sensitive user data and credentials to an attacker-controlled server."
