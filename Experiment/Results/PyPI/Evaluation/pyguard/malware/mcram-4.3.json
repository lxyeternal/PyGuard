      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware to evade detection. The base64-encoded command likely contains a PowerShell script that performs unauthorized or malicious actions, such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise. Additionally, this execution occurs automatically during the import or setup phase without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious package behavior. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution embedded in the setup script strongly indicates malicious intent."
