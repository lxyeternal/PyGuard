      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence mechanism. Additionally, the author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') along with the commented URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' hint at a suspicious or malicious source. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a known technique for stealthy code execution, potentially for downloading or executing further payloads, privilege escalation, or persistence. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during the setup phase strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malicious package installation behavior."
