      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. This pattern of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with spawning a hidden PowerShell process is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy execution of malicious payloads, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further malicious code. Additionally, this execution happens automatically during the setup script execution, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks in Python packages. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands strongly indicates malicious intent."
