      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that downloads a Python script from a hardcoded, non-official GitHub URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotInfected/tasgasgasg/main/WindowsUpdate.py) during the package installation process. It writes this script to the current working directory and immediately executes it using a subprocess call without any validation, user consent, or integrity checks. After execution, it deletes the downloaded script file. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary remote code execution on the user's system during package installation. The absence of any legitimate reason for executing external code at install time, combined with the direct download and execution of untrusted code, strongly indicates malicious intent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators, including remote code execution during install, downloading and running untrusted code, lack of user interaction or notification, and use of suspicious external URLs. Therefore, the code is malicious."
