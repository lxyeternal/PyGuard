      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command, combined with spawning a hidden shell process, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute payloads, perform privilege escalation, or download and run further malicious code. Additionally, the code performs this action immediately upon import or execution, without any legitimate business logic or user consent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution embedded in the setup script strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during package installation."
