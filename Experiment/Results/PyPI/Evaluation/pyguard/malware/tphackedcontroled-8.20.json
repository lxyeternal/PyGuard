      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads from a suspicious URL (notably the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip). This pattern of obfuscated command execution during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and stealthy payload delivery. The package metadata also uses suspicious names and author information that do not correspond to legitimate libraries. Overall, the combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
