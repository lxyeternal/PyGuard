      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed conditionally based on the absence of a directory named 'tahg' suggests stealth and persistence mechanisms. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions such as invoking web requests or downloading/executing further payloads from the suspicious domain 'dl.dropbox.com' (as partially visible in the decoded command). This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector and is exclusively observed in malware samples. The rest of the setup code appears to be a decoy or cover, with typical package metadata but no legitimate reason for executing such a hidden PowerShell command. Therefore, this code is malicious."
