      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec(). The encrypted payload is decrypted with a hardcoded Fernet key and immediately executed without any user interaction or validation. This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The code executes arbitrary code at install time, which can perform any malicious actions on the victim system. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
