      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential-stealing malware targeting Windows systems. It collects sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords, billing information, and user environment details without user consent. It uses Windows APIs to decrypt encrypted browser data (e.g., Chrome passwords and cookies) and extracts Discord tokens from various local storage paths. The code then exfiltrates this stolen data to an attacker-controlled Telegram bot webhook URL (hardcoded with a bot token and chat ID). It also archives and uploads various wallet, gaming, and application data to anonymous file hosting services, further facilitating data theft. The code runs multiple threads to stealthily gather data from browsers, Discord clients, and user directories, and sends the collected information over the network automatically. It installs required dependencies silently if missing, kills processes to access locked files, and uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 decoding and AES decryption to extract credentials. The presence of hardcoded Telegram bot tokens, exfiltration URLs, and the systematic collection and transmission of sensitive credentials and tokens clearly indicate malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware."
