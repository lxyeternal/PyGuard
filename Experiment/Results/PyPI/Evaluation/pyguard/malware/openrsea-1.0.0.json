      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded string and decrypted at runtime, then executed immediately without any user interaction or consent. This pattern of embedding encrypted code and executing it during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The use of exec on decrypted data, especially in an install hook, enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description strings further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. The presence of network-related modules (requests) in the install hook suggests potential for network communication or data exfiltration, although the exact decrypted payload is not visible here. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including code obfuscation, encrypted payload execution during install, and use of exec on decrypted data."
