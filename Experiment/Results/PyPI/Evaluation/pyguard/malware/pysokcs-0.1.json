      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It performs conditional checks on command-line arguments and platform, then enters loops with large numeric state variables controlling flow. The code imports modules like pip and win32com, attempts to create and write files in user directories (e.g., environment variables like APPDATA), and uses Windows COM interfaces to create shortcuts and save files. It walks through directories, searches for files with specific extensions, and writes data to them. The obfuscation and dynamic construction of strings from built-in functions and character codes strongly indicate an attempt to evade static analysis. The code also checks for administrative privileges and conditionally executes different code paths. The presence of setup() call with a suspicious package name 'pysokcs' (likely a typo of 'pysocks') suggests a malicious package masquerading as a legitimate one. The overall behavior matches known malicious patterns such as: - Obfuscated code to evade detection - Writing files to user/system directories without user consent - Using Windows COM to create shortcuts (potential persistence mechanism) - Walking directories and manipulating files - Checking for admin privileges to escalate or adapt behavior - Importing pip to install or execute additional packages - No legitimate user interaction or business logic - Execution triggered during package setup/install phase This combination of obfuscation, file system manipulation, privilege checks, and dynamic code execution during installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
