      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class GruppeInstall that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code via exec on data decrypted by Fernet using a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This pattern of decrypting and immediately executing code during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent. The use of obfuscated encrypted payloads executed at install time is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. Additionally, the package name 'bip-utilds' appears suspicious and possibly typosquatted. The code does not provide any legitimate user interaction or business logic and executes hidden code during installation, which is a critical risk behavior. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
