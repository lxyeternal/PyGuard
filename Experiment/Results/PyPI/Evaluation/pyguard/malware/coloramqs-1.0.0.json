      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary decrypted code during the package installation process on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). It imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules dynamically and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an opaque, base64-encoded payload, which is then executed immediately via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The package name and metadata are suspicious and nonsensical, likely to evade detection. The use of exec on decrypted data during installation enables remote code execution and payload delivery, which is a critical risk indicator of malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code runs automatically during installation, which is a common vector for malware to compromise systems via Python package managers."
