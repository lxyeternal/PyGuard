      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally (only if the 'tahg' directory does not exist) suggests stealth and evasion techniques. This pattern—executing obfuscated PowerShell commands in hidden mode during package setup—is a well-known hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script but silently triggers this hidden execution. There is no legitimate reason for such obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution in a setup script, and no user consent or notification is present. Therefore, this code is malicious."
