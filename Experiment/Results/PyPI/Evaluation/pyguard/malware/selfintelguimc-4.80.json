      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or performing system compromise. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip), which further supports malicious intent. The use of obfuscation (Base64 encoding) combined with hidden PowerShell execution is a classic hallmark of malware, especially in supply chain attacks or malicious Python packages. Therefore, this code is malicious."
