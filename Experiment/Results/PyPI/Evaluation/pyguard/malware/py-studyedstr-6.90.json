      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only then executes the PowerShell command, which is a common evasion technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads or performs unauthorized actions. This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a setup script is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The presence of a suspicious author email and package name further supports the malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call, but the hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell command during installation is a critical risk indicator of malware."
