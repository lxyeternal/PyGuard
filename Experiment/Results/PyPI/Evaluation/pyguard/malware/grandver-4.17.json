      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' suppresses any visible window, enabling stealthy execution. This pattern—obfuscated PowerShell command execution in a hidden window during package setup—is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, commonly seen in supply chain attacks or malware that executes payloads during installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution alongside it strongly suggests the package is designed to execute malicious code during installation without user consent or notification."
