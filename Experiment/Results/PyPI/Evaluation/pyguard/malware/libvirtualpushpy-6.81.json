      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently is a classic malware technique for executing hidden payloads or downloading/executing further malicious code. Additionally, the author and email fields reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which are suspicious and may be linked to malicious actors. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution during import or setup is a supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code runs during package installation or import without user consent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package setup, all of which are hallmarks of malicious activity."
