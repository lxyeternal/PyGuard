      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a hidden PowerShell window executing a base64-encoded command. This command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of subprocess to spawn PowerShell with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests evasion or persistence behavior. The presence of a suspicious author email and package name further supports the likelihood of malicious activity. The rest of the code is a setup call that appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except block, possibly to suppress errors and avoid detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, and lack of legitimate user interaction or business logic strongly indicates malicious behavior."
