      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the directory existence check for 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or staging technique. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or performing system compromise. Additionally, the package name 'tpproofadpyw' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and may be typosquatted or attacker-controlled. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with immediate execution of a PowerShell command in a setup script is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The code suppresses errors silently and executes the payload during package setup, which is a known vector for malicious code execution during installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
