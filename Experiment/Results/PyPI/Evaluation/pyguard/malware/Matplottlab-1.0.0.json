      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The package name 'Matplottlab' is suspiciously similar to a popular package 'matplotlib', indicating possible typosquatting. The use of obfuscated class names and encrypted payloads executed during installation strongly suggests a supply chain attack vector designed to execute arbitrary malicious code on the victim's machine during package installation. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code forcibly executes hidden payloads, which is a critical risk indicator of malware."
