      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests stealth and evasion. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially harmful commands. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions, possibly downloading or executing further payloads or performing system modifications without user consent. Additionally, the package metadata and author information appear suspicious (e.g., 'EsqueleSquad', 'tahgoficial@proton.me'), and the presence of a try-except block suppresses errors, which is common in malware to avoid detection. The setup call itself appears benign but is used here as a cover or delivery mechanism. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth execution flags, and suppression of errors strongly indicates malicious intent."
