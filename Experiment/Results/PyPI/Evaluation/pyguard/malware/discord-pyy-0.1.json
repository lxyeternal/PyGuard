      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It performs platform checks and command-line argument checks to trigger hidden behaviors. The code imports modules like pip and win32com.client.Dispatch, uses environment variables to construct paths in user directories, writes files with obfuscated names, and creates Windows shortcuts. It also checks for administrative privileges and performs file system traversal and manipulation. The obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns, combined with writing to user directories, creating shortcuts, and importing system automation modules, strongly indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be a supply chain attack or installer trojan that executes hidden payloads during package setup, potentially for persistence, privilege escalation, or further payload delivery. These behaviors align with known malware patterns such as stealthy code execution during installation, environment reconnaissance, and payload staging. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
