      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window), which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful commands. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name 'libvirtualpipvisa' with author information linked to 'EsqueleSquad' further suggest malicious intent. The subprocess call uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide the execution window, which is typical in malware to avoid user awareness. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, suspicious naming, and lack of user interaction or notification strongly indicates this code is malicious."
