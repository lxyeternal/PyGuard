      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking a web request to a suspicious URL (notably 'dl.dropbox.com' with a query parameter), which is a known pattern for downloading or executing remote payloads. This execution happens automatically during the import or setup phase without user interaction or consent. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the true intent of the command further confirm malicious intent. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious author information and a non-standard package name, which may be typosquatting or a disguise. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and potential remote code execution, consistent with malware or a supply chain attack."
