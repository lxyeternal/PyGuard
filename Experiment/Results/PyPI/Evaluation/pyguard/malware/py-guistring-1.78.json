      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a stealth or persistence check. The PowerShell command runs in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden) and uses the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to avoid user detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, and lack of user interaction or notification strongly indicates that this code is malicious."
