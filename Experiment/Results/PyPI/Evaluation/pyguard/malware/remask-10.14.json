      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, often used for downloading, executing further payloads, or performing unauthorized actions on the victim system. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation without user consent or interaction. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during installation is a critical risk indicator of malware."
