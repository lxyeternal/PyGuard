      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded), which is a classic obfuscation and stealth technique commonly used by malware. The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which suggests evasion or staging behavior. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe', indicating remote code execution and potential payload delivery. This behavior is typical of supply chain attacks or malware that executes arbitrary code during package installation or setup. The rest of the code (the setup call) appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except to suppress errors, which may be an attempt to hide the malicious activity. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and remote payload execution during package setup strongly classifies this code as malicious."
