      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This behavior is executed automatically during the setup script execution, which is a known supply chain attack vector where malicious code runs during package installation. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands, hidden execution, and automatic triggering during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent, likely for executing a hidden payload or performing unauthorized actions on the host system."
