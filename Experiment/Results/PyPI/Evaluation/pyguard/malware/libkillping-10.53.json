      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized or harmful actions, as suggested by the suspicious domain 'www.esquelesquad.rip' in the comment and the obfuscated nature of the command. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading and executing further payloads. The presence of this behavior in a setup script, which runs during package installation without user interaction or consent, further confirms the malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
