      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, a typical stealth technique. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup or install time is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as legitimate packages rarely execute hidden shell commands with encoded payloads during installation. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call wrapped in try/except, likely to mask errors and avoid detection. Overall, this pattern matches known malware behaviors involving obfuscated code execution, stealth process spawning, and potential payload delivery or system compromise during package installation."
