      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads from the suspicious URL 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm...'. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic hallmark of malware, often used in supply chain attacks to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system during package installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscated commands is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
