      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large, base64-encoded and encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted payloads, and the execution of decrypted code without user consent or validation strongly indicate a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. The package name 'seleenim' is suspiciously similar to 'selenium', suggesting possible typosquatting. The code does not perform any legitimate installation tasks before executing the hidden payload, which is a critical risk indicator. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
