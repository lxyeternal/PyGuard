      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a command that invokes a PowerShell expression, which is a strong indicator of downloading or executing a remote payload. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name 'tpsupermcmc' with a comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip', which is not a known legitimate source. These factors combined—obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process creation, suspicious URLs, and lack of user consent—are hallmark indicators of malicious behavior, likely aimed at executing a hidden payload or performing unauthorized actions on the host system."
