      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call to a suspicious URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/10797494975475150594048/Esquele.exe) which downloads an executable named 'Esquele.exe' to the Windows cache directory and executes it. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and runs a secondary payload stealthily. Additionally, the package metadata references 'EsqueleSquad' and an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which may be associated with malicious actors. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and downloading/executing a remote executable during package setup strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. Therefore, this code is malicious."
