      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It contains a hardcoded Discord webhook URL to which it sends a notification message immediately upon execution, without any user interaction or consent, indicating automated data exfiltration. It clones a GitHub repository from a suspicious URL ('https://github.com/NotInfected/updater.git') into a fixed system path ('C:\\Users\\repo') and then executes a script ('bypass.py') from that repository using subprocess, which is a classic pattern of downloading and executing potentially untrusted remote code. This behavior occurs during the package setup phase, which is a known supply chain attack vector allowing arbitrary code execution during installation. The combination of network communication, remote code retrieval, and execution without validation or user consent, along with the use of a hardcoded webhook for external notification, strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with remote code execution, data exfiltration, and potential system compromise."

It contains a hardcoded Discord webhook URL to which it sends a notification message ('¡Alguien ha instalado el paquete reverse_shell!') without any user consent or interaction, indicating automated data exfiltration. It clones a GitHub repository from a suspicious URL ('https://github.com/NotInfected/updater.git') into a fixed system path ('C:\\Users\\repo') without user permission, then changes the working directory to that path and executes a script ('bypass.py') from the cloned repository via subprocess. This sequence of downloading and executing remote code without validation or user consent is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and potential payload delivery. The naming of the package ('reverse_shell') and the repository ('updater.git') along with the script name ('bypass.py') further suggest malicious intent, likely to establish a reverse shell or bypass security controls. The code runs these actions automatically on execution, with no legitimate business logic or user interaction, and uses network communication to an attacker-controlled endpoint. These behaviors align with known patterns of supply chain attacks, remote code execution, and data exfiltration malware."

These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including automated data exfiltration, remote code execution, and supply chain attack patterns."
