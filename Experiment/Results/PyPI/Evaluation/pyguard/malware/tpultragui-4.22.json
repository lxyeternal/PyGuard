      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or performing system compromise. Additionally, the use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command and the execution during the setup script (package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector. The author and email fields referencing 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me' along with the suspicious comment and domain 'www.esquelesquad.rip' further support malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during package installation, which is a hallmark of malware."
