      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, a typical stealth technique. This behavior is executed automatically during the setup script execution, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks and malicious code execution during package installation. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell command execution, stealth process spawning, and conditional execution without user interaction or notification strongly indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution is a critical risk indicator of malware."
