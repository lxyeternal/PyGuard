      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious credential stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and other sensitive user data. It collects environment information such as IP address and username, then searches through various browser and Discord application data directories for tokens, cookies, and passwords. It decrypts encrypted data using Windows APIs and AES decryption, indicating it targets Windows systems. The code exfiltrates stolen data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, sending detailed user information including tokens, billing info, badges, and friends list. It also collects files from user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) matching sensitive keywords and uploads them to anonymous file hosting services. The use of obfuscated variable names, base64 decoding, threading for stealth, subprocess calls to kill processes, and automated installation of dependencies without user consent further confirm malicious intent. The code operates silently without user interaction, suppresses exceptions, and uses multiple network requests to gather and send data. All these behaviors align with known malware patterns for information stealing and data exfiltration."
