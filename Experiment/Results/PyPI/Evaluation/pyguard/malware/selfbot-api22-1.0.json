      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains a highly obfuscated and suspicious variable with a very long string composed of multiple layers of encoding and compression: base85, base32, base16, base64, lzma, and zlib, followed by marshal.loads and exec to execute the decoded and decompressed payload. This pattern of multi-layered obfuscation combined with dynamic code execution (exec on marshal.loads of decompressed data) is a strong and exclusive indicator of malicious behavior. The code is embedded within a setuptools setup script, which means the malicious payload will execute during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated variable name and the absence of any legitimate business logic or user interaction further support the conclusion that this code is designed to hide and execute unauthorized, potentially harmful code. Therefore, this code is malicious."
