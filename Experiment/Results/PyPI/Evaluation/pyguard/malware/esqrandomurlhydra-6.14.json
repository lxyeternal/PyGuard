      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and attempts to invoke a web request to download or execute content from that URL. This pattern of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with spawning a hidden PowerShell process to execute remote code is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy payload delivery, remote code execution, or persistence. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code is a setup call that appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except to suppress errors, which may be used to hide malicious activity during package installation. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and consistent with known malicious supply chain attacks or malware installation scripts."
