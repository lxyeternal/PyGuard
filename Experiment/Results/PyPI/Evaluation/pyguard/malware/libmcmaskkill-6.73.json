      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known method for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads, often used in malware for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further malicious payloads. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a package with a suspicious name 'libmcmaskkill' and author 'EsqueleSquad', which may be a disguise or part of a supply chain attack. The try/except blocks suppress errors, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process creation, and suspicious package metadata strongly indicates malicious behavior."
