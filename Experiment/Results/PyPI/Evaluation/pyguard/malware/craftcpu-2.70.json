      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command. This pattern of obfuscation (base64-encoded PowerShell command), stealth execution (hidden window), and conditional execution based on the presence of a directory is a hallmark of malware, often used for persistence, payload delivery, or further exploitation. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation without user consent or interaction. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution makes the entire code malicious."
