      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell commands executed silently is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. This combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
