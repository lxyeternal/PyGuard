      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a temporary Python script file containing code that downloads and executes Python code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/e9ysm/raw) without any user interaction or validation. It then attempts to execute this script in a new process using the Python executable in windowed mode (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe'), which is a known technique to run code stealthily on Windows. This dynamic retrieval and execution of remote code during the package setup phase is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The use of temporary files to stage the payload, the absence of any user consent or notification, and the execution of arbitrary code fetched from an untrusted external source strongly indicate malicious intent. The rest of the setup() call appears to be a facade to disguise the malicious behavior within a seemingly normal package installation script."
