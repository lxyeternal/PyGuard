      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as indicated by the decoded command string containing an Invoke-WebRequest call to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and outputting to a file named '~\\WindowsCache.exe'. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and executes a secondary payload without user consent or notification. The presence of this code in a setup script further indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation. The use of try/except to silently ignore errors also suggests an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell command execution, hidden process spawning, and downloading/executing a remote executable strongly indicates malicious intent."
