      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW ensures the PowerShell window is hidden, a known stealth technique. This behavior is executed automatically during the setup script execution, which is a classic supply chain attack vector where malicious code runs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscated commands strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, especially without user notification or interaction. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy payload execution and potential further compromise."
