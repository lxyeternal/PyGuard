      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscated class names, hardcoded encrypted data, and execution of decrypted code during installation is consistent with supply chain attacks and malware delivery mechanisms. Additionally, the package name 'requiremntstxt' is suspiciously similar to 'requirements.txt', a common file name, which may indicate typosquatting to trick users. The presence of network-related imports (requests) inside the install hook suggests potential network communication, possibly for downloading or exfiltrating data, although the exact decrypted payload is not visible. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious intent, including code obfuscation, dynamic code execution during install, and potential network activity."
