      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe', which is likely a malicious payload. The presence of a directory existence check ('tahg') before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command, the execution of a remote payload during package setup, and the suspicious author and email information further confirm malicious intent. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector where malicious code is executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise."
