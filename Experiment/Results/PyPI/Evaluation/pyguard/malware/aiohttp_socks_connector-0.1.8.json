      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with known malware patterns and supply chain attacks. Key malicious characteristics include: \n\n1. Execution of base64-decoded code that is written to a temporary directory (__pycache__ in the user's local appdata temp folder) and then executed via VBScript files, which is a common obfuscation and payload delivery technique.\n\n2. The code runs automatically during package installation (setup.py install hook), without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks.\n\n3. It collects extensive environment and user information, including user profile paths, local appdata, and system directories.\n\n4. It enumerates and reads sensitive files such as browser cookies (via browser_cookie3), local application data, roaming profiles, documents, downloads, desktop, and program files.\n\n5. It decrypts and exfiltrates sensitive data, including passwords and cookies, to remote servers using HTTP POST requests to suspicious or hardcoded endpoints.\n\n6. The code uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding/decoding and zlib compression to hide payloads and network communication.\n\n7. It spawns subprocesses with obfuscated PowerShell commands in hidden windows, a known technique for stealthy execution and payload deployment.\n\n8. It writes multiple plugin modules and scripts to user directories and executes them, indicating multi-stage payload delivery.\n\n9. The presence of classes and functions named like 'address_st3aler', 'Decryptor', and 'search_plugin_paths' strongly suggests credential stealing and data exfiltration.\n\n10. The code contacts hardcoded IP addresses and URLs that are not associated with legitimate package repositories or services.\n\n11. It uses threading and asynchronous calls to perform background tasks such as data collection and network communication, evading detection.\n\n12. The overall structure and behavior match known malware supply chain attacks that hijack Python package installation to execute arbitrary malicious code.\n\nGiven these points, the code is conclusively malicious and designed to steal sensitive user data, execute hidden payloads, and exfiltrate information without user consent."
