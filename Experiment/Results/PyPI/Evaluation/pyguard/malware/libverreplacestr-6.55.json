      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or consent, indicating an attempt to hide the true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further suggests malicious intent. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, enhancing stealth. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts that execute hidden payloads during setup. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
