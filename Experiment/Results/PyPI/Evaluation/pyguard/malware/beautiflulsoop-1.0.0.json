      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The obfuscated class name and the use of encrypted code executed during installation strongly indicate a supply chain attack vector. The code attempts to run arbitrary code on the user's system during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The presence of network-related imports (requests) alongside encrypted payload execution further suggests potential for downloading or communicating with remote servers. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious intent."
