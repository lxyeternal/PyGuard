      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a command that invokes a web request to download and run an executable (WindowsCache.exe) from that URL. This pattern of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and downloading/executing remote payloads is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy payload delivery, persistence, or further exploitation. Additionally, the package name and author information appear suspicious and unrelated to the described functionality, which further supports the malicious intent. The use of try/except to silently suppress errors also indicates an attempt to evade detection or prevent interruption. Overall, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
