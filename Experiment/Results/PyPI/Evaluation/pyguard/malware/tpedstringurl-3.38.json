      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) which is likely a payload download or execution attempt. The presence of a directory existence check ('tahg') before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command, the hidden execution, and the suspicious external URL are classic hallmarks of malware, such as a downloader or remote code execution payload. Additionally, the package metadata references 'EsqueleSquad' and an email address, which may be a threat actor or malicious group. The setup call is wrapped in a try/except block, likely to suppress errors and avoid detection. Overall, this code is a supply chain attack vector that executes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell payload from a suspicious external source during package installation or execution, which is a critical risk and clearly malicious."
