      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Within this method, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded byte string, which is decrypted at runtime and executed immediately without any user interaction or validation. This pattern of embedding encrypted code and executing it during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The package name 'Matploltlab' is a suspicious typo-squatting variant of a popular library, which is a common tactic used by attackers to trick users into installing malicious packages. The use of obfuscated class names and meaningless description strings further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Executing arbitrary decrypted code during installation can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
