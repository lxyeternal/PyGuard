      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the package name, the current logged-in username (os.getlogin()), the hostname (platform.node()), detailed platform information (platform.uname()), the current working directory (os.getcwd()), and the local IP address determined by creating a UDP socket to 8.8.8.8. It then encodes this collected data in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://162.62.15.24/v/<base64_data>). This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and user identity information without user consent or notification. The data exfiltration occurs during the package setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the transmitted data and the hardcoded suspicious IP address further indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware embedded in a Python package installation script."
