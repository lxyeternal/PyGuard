      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealth execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the payload, which is a typical evasion or persistence technique. The comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further suggest malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup, hidden process creation, and lack of user interaction or notification strongly indicate this code is malicious."
