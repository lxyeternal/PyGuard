      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which are typical stealth techniques to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or performing system compromise. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious URL comment ('www.esquelesquad.rip'), which may be attacker-controlled or related to malicious infrastructure. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with immediate execution of a shell command during package setup is a classic supply chain attack pattern. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the code runs automatically during installation. These factors collectively indicate that the code is malicious."
