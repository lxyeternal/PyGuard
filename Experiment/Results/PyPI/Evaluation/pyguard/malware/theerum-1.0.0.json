      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Inside this method, it checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and immediately executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a byte string and decrypted at runtime with a hardcoded key. This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector enabling remote code execution without user consent. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the presence of encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code during install time strongly indicate malicious intent. The code also specifies 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup requirements, likely to support the malicious payload's network and cryptographic operations. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the payload runs silently during installation, which is typical for malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with a supply chain attack that executes hidden, potentially harmful code on Windows systems during package installation."
