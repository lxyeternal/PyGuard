      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally based on the absence of a directory named 'tahg' suggests stealthy execution of potentially harmful or unauthorized actions. This pattern of obfuscated command execution via PowerShell in a setup script is a known hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy payload delivery, persistence, or remote code execution. The use of a suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further supports suspicion. The rest of the code is a typical setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and should be treated as malicious."
