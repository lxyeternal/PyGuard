      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded and obfuscated, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting a stealth or persistence check. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, hiding its execution from the user. The presence of a suspicious URL in a comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during the setup phase strongly indicate this is a supply chain attack or malware embedded in a Python package installation script. The code does not perform any legitimate user interaction or notification before executing the hidden payload. These behaviors align with known malware patterns such as stealth execution, obfuscation, and unauthorized remote code execution during package installation."
