      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a list of executables from a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt), filters them based on the current operating system, then downloads each executable file from the same external server. It writes these executables to the current working directory without any user consent or validation, changes their permissions to executable on Unix-like systems, and immediately executes them in the background. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware: automatic retrieval and execution of potentially untrusted binaries from a remote server. The code also hooks into all HTTP method functions (get, post, put, patch, delete, head, options, request) to run this payload before performing any HTTP request, ensuring the malicious payload executes whenever these functions are called. There is no user interaction, no validation, no logging, and no legitimate business logic to justify this behavior. The use of a hardcoded IP address rather than a domain name, the silent background execution, and the lack of any safeguards or transparency strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote payload download, file writing without consent, permission modification, and immediate execution of untrusted code."
