      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a Python package setup script that hijacks the installation and development commands (via setuptools hooks) to execute a function named 'execute'. This function downloads a batch script ('install.bat') from a hardcoded external URL hosted on Discord's CDN, writes it to the current directory, and then executes it using a shell command. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where arbitrary code is fetched from an untrusted remote source and executed without user consent or validation during package installation. The use of setuptools install hooks to trigger network retrieval and execution of external code is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the downloaded script could perform any arbitrary action on the victim's system. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a high-risk indicator of remote code execution and potential system compromise."
