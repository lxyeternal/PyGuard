      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for evasion and to execute arbitrary or malicious payloads without user awareness. The base64-encoded command likely contains a PowerShell script that performs unauthorized actions such as downloading, executing further payloads, or system compromise. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means it executes during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. The package name 'pongreplace' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' do not correspond to known legitimate software, increasing suspicion. The try-except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window, conditional execution based on file system state, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
