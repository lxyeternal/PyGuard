      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a temporary Python script that contains a one-liner which downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/97vnn/raw) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. This dynamic retrieval and execution of remote code without any validation or user consent is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. Furthermore, the script attempts to execute this temporary file immediately in a new process using a system call that launches the Python interpreter in windowed mode (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe'), which is a stealth technique to run code without a visible console window. This occurs during the package setup phase, meaning the malicious payload is triggered automatically upon installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The package name 'ligitkidss' appears suspicious and possibly a typosquat. The combination of writing a temporary file, downloading and executing remote code dynamically, and launching it silently during installation strongly indicates malicious intent."
