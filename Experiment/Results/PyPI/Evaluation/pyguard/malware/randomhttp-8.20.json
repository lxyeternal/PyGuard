      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a typical stealth behavior. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute obfuscated PowerShell commands in a hidden manner is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can be used to download, execute, or perform unauthorized actions without user knowledge. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a known vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the setup call appears normal but is wrapped in a try/except pass block, which suppresses errors and may be used to hide failures or detection. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package installation strongly indicates malicious behavior."
