      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to invoking a web request to a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and runs an executable named 'xEsquelesquad.exe' from that host, which is a strong indicator of downloading and executing a potentially malicious payload. This pattern of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote code invocation is a hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks or trojanized packages. The presence of this behavior in a setup script further indicates an attempt to execute malicious code during package installation, a known vector for supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code is strongly indicative of malicious intent."
