      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it executes the PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The use of subprocess.Popen to spawn PowerShell with an encoded command, combined with the hidden window style, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it is a known technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell execution before it strongly suggests malicious intent."
