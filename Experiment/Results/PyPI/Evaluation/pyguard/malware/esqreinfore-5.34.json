      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing easy inspection of its intent, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, suggesting a persistence or evasion mechanism. The use of subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) hint at attacker-controlled infrastructure. The setup() call appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except that suppresses errors, which may be an attempt to hide failures. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, and suspicious domain references strongly indicates malicious intent."
