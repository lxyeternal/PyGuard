      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden) and uses the 'Invoke-WebRequest' cmdlet to download and execute a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0). This behavior is consistent with downloading and executing a secondary malicious payload without user consent or interaction. The presence of a suspicious author name 'EsqueleSquad' and email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' combined with the obfuscated PowerShell command and hidden execution strongly indicates malicious intent. The setup() call appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except that suppresses errors, possibly to hide failures and ensure the malicious code runs regardless. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, downloading and executing remote payloads, and evasion techniques."
