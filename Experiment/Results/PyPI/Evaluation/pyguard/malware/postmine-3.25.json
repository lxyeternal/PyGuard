      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a typical stealth behavior. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute obfuscated PowerShell commands in a hidden manner is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can be used to execute arbitrary code, download further payloads, or perform system compromise without user knowledge. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. The package name 'postmine' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' do not correspond to any known legitimate package, increasing suspicion. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is overshadowed by the hidden PowerShell execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads during package installation."
