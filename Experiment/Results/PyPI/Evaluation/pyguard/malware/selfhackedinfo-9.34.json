      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This obfuscation technique (base64-encoded PowerShell command) is a classic hallmark of malware attempting stealthy execution. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, the author and email fields in the setup call reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which are suspicious and potentially attacker-controlled. The presence of this code in a setup script suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent or interaction. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or data exfiltration. Overall, the combination of obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, conditional execution, and suspicious metadata strongly confirms malicious intent."
