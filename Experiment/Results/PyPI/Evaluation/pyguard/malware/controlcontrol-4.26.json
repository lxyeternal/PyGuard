      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command, combined with spawning a hidden shell process, is a classic technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful or unauthorized code. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The rest of the code is a setup call for a package, but the malicious payload is triggered immediately upon import or execution, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious packages. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package setup, all without user consent or legitimate purpose."
