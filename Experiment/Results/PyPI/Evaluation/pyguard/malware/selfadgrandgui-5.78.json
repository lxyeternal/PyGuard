      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and outputs it to a file named '~\\WindowsCache.exe', then executes it. This behavior is consistent with downloading and executing a remote payload without user consent, a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious author information and a suspicious package name 'selfadgrandgui' with a comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip', which is likely attacker-controlled. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the code is a clear example of a supply chain attack or malicious package installer that downloads and executes a hidden payload from a remote source."
