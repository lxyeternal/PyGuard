      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The Base64-encoded PowerShell command likely contains obfuscated instructions that are executed without user interaction or notification. This pattern of obfuscated command execution via PowerShell in a hidden window is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code performs this action automatically during import or setup without any user consent or legitimate business logic, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malware embedded in Python packages. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask errors and avoid detection, further supporting malicious intent."
