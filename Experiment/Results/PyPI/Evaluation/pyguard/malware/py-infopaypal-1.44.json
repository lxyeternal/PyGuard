      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell commands executed silently is a classic technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious URL comment (www.esquelesquad.rip), which further suggests malicious intent. The use of such obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup or installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery. Therefore, this code is malicious."
