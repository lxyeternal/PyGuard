      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The PowerShell command is executed in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden) and the subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, both of which are stealth techniques to avoid user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to evade repeated detection or to stage payloads. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) further raises suspicion. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, which appears to be a cover or a delivery mechanism for the malicious payload. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup/install is a known supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code is malicious."
