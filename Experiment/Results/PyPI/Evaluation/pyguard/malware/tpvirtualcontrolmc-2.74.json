      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a stealth technique to avoid user awareness. The presence of a suspicious URL in a comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or a cover for the malicious payload. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, and conditional execution during package setup strongly indicates this code is designed for malicious purposes, likely for executing a hidden payload or downloading/executing further malicious code."
