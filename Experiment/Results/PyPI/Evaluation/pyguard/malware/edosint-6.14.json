      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or redundant execution. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a known stealth technique. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently during the setup phase (package installation) is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious payload delivery. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during installation strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the obfuscation and stealth execution strongly suggest this code is designed to execute unauthorized or harmful actions on the host system."
