      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and eval/compile functions, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. It dynamically decodes and executes compressed and encoded payloads at runtime without any user interaction or consent. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, making analysis difficult and indicating an attempt to evade detection. The presence of multiple layers of decoding and decompression followed by immediate execution (via eval or exec) is a classic malware technique to hide payloads and execute arbitrary code. Additionally, the code imports and uses modules in an obfuscated manner, and the decoded payload likely contains further malicious instructions. Such behavior is consistent with supply chain attacks, remote code execution, or data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
