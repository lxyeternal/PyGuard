      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a typical stealth technique. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution during the setup phase of a Python package (in a try-except block to suppress errors) strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during package installation. The package name 'httphacked' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' also suggest suspicious intent. No legitimate user interaction or notification is present, and the code executes automatically on import or installation. These factors combined match multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package setup, which are hallmark techniques of malware."
