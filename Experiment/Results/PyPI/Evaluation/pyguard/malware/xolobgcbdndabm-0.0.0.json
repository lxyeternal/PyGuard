      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code imports the base64 module and immediately executes a large base64-decoded payload using exec(). This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide malicious code. The decoded payload is not visible in the source, preventing straightforward analysis. The use of exec on decoded data without any validation or user interaction is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such patterns are commonly used in malware to conceal payloads, execute arbitrary code, perform data exfiltration, or establish persistence. Given the extensive obfuscation and immediate execution of decoded content, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior."
