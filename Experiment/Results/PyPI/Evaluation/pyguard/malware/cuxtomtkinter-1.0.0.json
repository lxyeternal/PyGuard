      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a base64-encoded and encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The obfuscated class name and encrypted payload hide the true intent of the code, which is executed without user interaction or consent. The use of exec on decrypted data during install time, combined with network-related imports (requests) and cryptographic decryption (fernet), strongly indicates that the package is designed to execute hidden malicious code on Windows systems during installation. This behavior is consistent with critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and abuse of the Python packaging installation process for remote code execution."
