      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute a reverse shell payload during package installation. Specifically, it constructs a Python one-liner reverse shell command that connects back to a hardcoded IP address (121.4.154.240) and port (4501). This command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via a shell command during the install process. This behavior enables remote code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction, effectively giving an attacker remote shell access. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload, execution during package installation (a supply chain attack vector), and the hardcoded attacker-controlled IP and port are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is a classic example of a malicious backdoor embedded in a Python package's installation routine."
