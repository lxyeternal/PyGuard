      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class 'Updater' that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it constructs an obfuscated URL by concatenating string fragments to form a URL pointing to a remote server (https://cdn.discordapp.com/app.co1121082847780929579/1121087876713680936/qrcodegen.py). It then downloads a Python script from this URL using the 'requests' library and writes it to a local file named 'qrcodegen.py'. Immediately after, it executes this downloaded script as a subprocess using the current Python interpreter. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern: downloading and executing arbitrary code from an untrusted external source during package installation without user consent or validation. The obfuscation of the URL components and the automatic execution of remote code during install time are strong indicators of malicious intent. Such code can lead to remote code execution, system compromise, and potential data exfiltration or further payload delivery. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
