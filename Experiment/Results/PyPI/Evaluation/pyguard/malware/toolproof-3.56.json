      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The use of subprocess to launch PowerShell with an encoded command in a hidden window is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it is commonly used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, this execution occurs outside of any legitimate user action and is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a typical setup call for a Python package, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell execution makes the overall code malicious."
