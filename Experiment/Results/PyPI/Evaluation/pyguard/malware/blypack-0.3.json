      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function post_install() that executes a shell command via os.system to open a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP address (81.46.246.181) on port 4444 using bash. This function is called immediately after the setup() call, meaning the reverse shell is initiated automatically during package installation without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malicious code, specifically a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor, enabling an attacker to gain remote command execution on the victim's machine. The use of os.system to spawn an interactive bash shell redirected over a TCP connection to an external IP is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for such code in a setup script, and it exploits the package installation process to execute arbitrary code remotely. Therefore, this code is malicious."
