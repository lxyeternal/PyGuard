      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs in hidden window mode (WindowStyle Hidden) and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to suppress any console window, which is a stealth technique. The presence of a suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) along with the package name 'tptoolcpusplit' and package author 'EsqueleSquad' suggest a possible malicious or at least suspicious origin. The code runs this hidden PowerShell command automatically during the setup script execution without any user interaction or notification, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware embedded in Python packages. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used to download and execute further payloads, perform system reconnaissance, or establish persistence. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover or decoy to disguise the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
