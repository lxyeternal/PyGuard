      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction or validation, writes it to a path within the user's AppData Local directory under the name 'explorer.exe' (which mimics a legitimate Windows process name to evade suspicion), and then immediately executes this downloaded file using subprocess.run. This sequence of network retrieval of a binary payload, silent writing to a system/user directory, and immediate execution is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, specifically for payload delivery and execution. There is no integrity check, user consent, or notification, and the use of a misleading filename further indicates intent to evade detection. Such behavior is strongly associated with malicious activity, including remote code execution, persistence, or further compromise of the host system."
