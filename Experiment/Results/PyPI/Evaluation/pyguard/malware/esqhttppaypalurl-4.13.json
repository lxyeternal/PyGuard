      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess to run PowerShell with an encoded command, combined with the lack of legitimate user-facing functionality or explanation, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the package metadata and author information appear suspicious and unrelated to the described functionality, which is another red flag. The overall pattern matches known malware behaviors such as stealthy code execution, obfuscation, and potential payload delivery or system compromise during package installation."
