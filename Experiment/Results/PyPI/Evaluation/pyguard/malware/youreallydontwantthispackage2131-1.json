      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools commands that execute a shell command during package installation, development setup, or egg info generation. This shell command fetches an access token from the Google Cloud metadata server (a sensitive credential endpoint) without user consent, then immediately sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, attacker-controlled external URL (https://9435-34-42-190-190.ngrok-free.app/hellofrompip). This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential harvesting and exfiltration. The package name and author email are suspicious and suggest malicious intent. Executing such network and credential-exfiltration commands automatically during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate user interaction, notification, or business logic justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."
