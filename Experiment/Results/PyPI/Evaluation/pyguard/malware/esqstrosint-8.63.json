      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates an attempt to run the command stealthily without user notification. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during the setup phase is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code executes during package installation. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell command execution, stealth execution in hidden window, execution during package setup, and conditional execution based on file system state. Therefore, this code is malicious and likely intended to execute a hidden payload on Windows systems during package installation."
