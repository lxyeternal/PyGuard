      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during what appears to be a package setup or installation phase is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling stealthy execution of potentially harmful code on the victim's system. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation, all of which are hallmark traits of malware."
