      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (cdnd.discordapp.com/attachment/...), which is a known vector for malware delivery. Additionally, the package metadata uses a suspicious name ('py-hackednvidialib') and author information ('EsqueleSquad'), which are indicative of typosquatting or malicious intent. The code runs this payload during the setup process, which is a common supply chain attack technique to execute malicious code during package installation. These factors combined—obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, suspicious URLs, and execution during package setup—are strong indicators of malicious intent."
