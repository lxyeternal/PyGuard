      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The base64-encoded command itself is not directly visible but the pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The try/except blocks suppress errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious behavior. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy, obfuscated payload execution during package installation."
