      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads executable files from a hardcoded local URL (http://127.0.0.1:5000) and writes them to the Windows Temp directory without any user interaction or consent. It then executes one of these downloaded executables in the background using subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags. This behavior is triggered automatically during the package installation process (when 'pip install' is run with the 'install' argument), which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The downloaded executables are named in a way that suggests they are a listener, a keylogger payload, and a reverse shell, indicating intent to establish unauthorized remote access and monitor user activity. The combination of network retrieval of binaries, writing to system temporary directories, and silent execution during installation strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with remote access trojans (RATs), keyloggers, and reverse shells. There is no legitimate user notification, validation, or security checks, and the code abuses the setuptools install hook to execute this behavior, which is a hallmark of malicious Python packages."
