      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding, eval, and compile functions, which are classic indicators of malicious intent. It dynamically decodes and executes compressed and encoded payloads at runtime without any user interaction or validation. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, making analysis difficult and indicating an attempt to evade detection. It imports modules and functions dynamically and executes decoded data immediately, a hallmark of malware that delivers and runs hidden payloads. The presence of multiple layers of decoding and decompression followed by execution strongly suggests it is designed to conceal malicious payloads. The code also appears to perform environment checks and may execute different decoding paths based on the input, which is typical for adaptive malware. Given these factors and the absence of any legitimate application logic or user consent, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and payload delivery."
