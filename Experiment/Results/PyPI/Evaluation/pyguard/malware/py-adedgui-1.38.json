      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally based on the absence of a directory named 'tahg' suggests stealthy execution and possible persistence or payload delivery. The use of an encoded PowerShell command to invoke 'Invoke-WebRequest' to download or interact with a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) is a classic malware technique for downloading and executing further payloads or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the package metadata references 'EsqueleSquad' and an email address 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which along with the suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the hidden execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during import or setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. Therefore, this code is malicious."
