      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary decrypted code during package installation on Windows systems. Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large encrypted payload and immediately executes it with exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The obfuscated encrypted payload conceals the true nature of the executed code, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of exec on decrypted data during installation, combined with network-related imports, suggests potential for remote code execution, payload delivery, or data exfiltration. Such behavior is not typical for benign packages and is strongly associated with malware."
