      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the obfuscated base64 string and the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip). This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script but contains this covert payload execution, which is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
