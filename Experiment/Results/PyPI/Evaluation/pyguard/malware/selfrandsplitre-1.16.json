      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads or performs unauthorized actions. This pattern—obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup—is a well-known hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks or trojanized packages. The use of distutils setup with a suspicious package name and author email further supports the malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
