      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload embedded in the main() function. It downloads an executable file from a hardcoded suspicious URL (a Discord CDN link hosting a Windows executable named 'windows.exe') into the system's temporary directory without user consent or notification. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using subprocess.call. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware: automatic download and execution of a potentially untrusted binary from a remote source. The variable names in this section are obfuscated using unusual Unicode characters, which is a common evasion technique. The rest of the code appears to be unrelated utility or plotting functions, but the presence of this download-and-execute sequence, especially with obfuscated variable names and no user interaction, strongly indicates malicious intent."

It then immediately executes this downloaded file using subprocess.call. The variable and function names in this section are obfuscated using unusual Unicode characters, which is a common evasion technique. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: automated download and execution of untrusted remote code, obfuscation, lack of user interaction, and execution of potentially harmful binaries. The rest of the code appears to be benign utility and plotting functions unrelated to this malicious behavior, likely included to disguise the malicious payload. Therefore, this code is malicious due to the embedded downloader and executor of a remote executable."
