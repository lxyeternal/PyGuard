      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (cdnd.discordapp.com with a path that looks like an attachment), which is a common technique for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, or remote code execution. This pattern—obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently during package setup—is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script but contains this hidden malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
