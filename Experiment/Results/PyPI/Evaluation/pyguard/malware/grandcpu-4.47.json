      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, a typical stealth technique. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute an obfuscated PowerShell command in a hidden window without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a known vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the presence of this hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution during installation is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."
