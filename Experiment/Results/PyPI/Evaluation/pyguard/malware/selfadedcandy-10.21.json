      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed in hidden mode is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The setup call with suspicious package name 'selfadedcandy' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests a malicious supply chain attack vector. The combination of obfuscated command execution during package setup/install is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
