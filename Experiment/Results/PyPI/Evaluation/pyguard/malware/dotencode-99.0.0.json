      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command. During installation, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eol6mx6at717hhs.m.pipedream.net/dotencode) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it silently exfiltrates system and user information during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a custom install hook to perform network communication during installation, combined with the collection and transmission of potentially sensitive environment data to an attacker-controlled endpoint, matches multiple critical risk patterns associated exclusively with malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the external URL is not a known trusted endpoint. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with credential or environment data theft during package installation."
