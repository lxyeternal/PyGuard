      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Inside this method, it checks if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'). If so, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time, especially within a setuptools install hook, is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated encrypted data and immediate execution without user consent or validation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the package name 'Matplotlbib' appears to be a typo-squatted variant of a popular library, which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The code also specifies dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious payload execution path, further indicating the intent to perform network operations or payload delivery. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated payload execution during package installation, use of encryption to hide malicious code, and execution of arbitrary code on the victim system without user interaction."
