      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the command being executed. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The PowerShell command itself is obfuscated and likely performs unauthorized actions such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads. Additionally, this execution occurs at import time or during setup, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution alongside it strongly indicates malicious behavior."
