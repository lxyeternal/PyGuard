      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the command being executed. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during the setup phase strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during package installation. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation without user consent."
