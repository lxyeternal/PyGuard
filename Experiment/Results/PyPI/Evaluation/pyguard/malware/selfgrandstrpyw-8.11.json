      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip and the encoded command referencing a suspicious domain 'cdn.discordapp.com' with a path that looks like an attachment). This pattern of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote payload execution during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The use of distutils setup with a suspicious package name and author email further supports the malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute a hidden PowerShell payload from a remote source during installation, which is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malware."
