      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindoowsCache.exe' from that URL. This pattern of obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and downloading/executing a remote payload is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, or persistence. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious author information and a suspicious package name ('libpushramvisa' by 'EsqueleSquad'), which may be a typosquatted or malicious package. The presence of try/except blocks suppressing errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
