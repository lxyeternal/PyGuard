      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a command that invokes a web request to download and run an executable (WindowsCache.exe) from that URL. This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a hidden window, combined with downloading and executing a remote payload, is a strong indicator of malware. Additionally, the package name and author information appear suspicious and unrelated to the described functionality, which is typical in supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to silently suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a potentially malicious payload during package setup, which is a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks."
