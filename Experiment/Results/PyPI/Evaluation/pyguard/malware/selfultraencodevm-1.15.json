      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the use of a hidden PowerShell window strongly indicate stealthy, potentially malicious behavior. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name, which may be used to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. These factors combined align with known malicious patterns such as obfuscated code execution, stealth execution, and potential remote code execution or payload delivery during package installation."
