      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, a typical stealth technique. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently during package setup is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as legitimate packages rarely execute hidden shell commands with obfuscated payloads during installation. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask errors and avoid raising suspicion. Overall, this pattern matches known malware behaviors involving obfuscated code execution, stealth process spawning, and potential payload delivery or system compromise during package installation."
