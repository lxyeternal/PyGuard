      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, hiding its true intent. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade detection or repeated runs. The use of subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest attacker-controlled infrastructure. The setup call appears to be a decoy or cover, as it is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors and does not relate to the malicious payload. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates this code is malicious."
