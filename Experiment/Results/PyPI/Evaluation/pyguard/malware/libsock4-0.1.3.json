      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It creates a temporary file and writes obfuscated Python code that downloads and executes code from a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://pub-6604e90a2a124b9a829b977f9fe4aeec.r2.dev/W0IyABv1wrUvm) without any user interaction or consent. The downloaded code is executed immediately via exec, which is a critical risk pattern for remote code execution and payload delivery. Furthermore, on Windows systems, it attempts to spawn a new process running the Python executable with a modified name (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe') to execute the temporary file, which is a known evasion technique to run code in a hidden or background mode. This behavior occurs during the package setup phase, effectively hijacking the installation process to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code. The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of validation or integrity checks on the downloaded code, and the silent execution of remote code during installation are hallmark signs of a supply chain attack and malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
