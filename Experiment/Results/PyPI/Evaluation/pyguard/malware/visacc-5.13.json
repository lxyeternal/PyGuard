      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The use of subprocess to spawn PowerShell with an encoded command, combined with the lack of legitimate context or user consent, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the hidden execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during installation is a critical risk indicator of malware."
