      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it runs obfuscated PowerShell code silently without user interaction or notification. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute hidden payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or unwanted runs. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raises suspicion. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the hidden execution of obfuscated PowerShell during installation or setup is a classic supply chain attack pattern. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, lack of user consent, and use of encoded PowerShell commands, all of which are hallmark signs of malicious activity."
