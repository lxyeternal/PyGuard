      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell command). This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed immediately upon import, combined with the check for a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution), is a classic stealth technique used by malware to execute obfuscated payloads. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the suspicious package name 'selfLGTBpep' authored by 'EsqueleSquad' further suggest malicious intent. The setup call appears to be a decoy or to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script context, without user consent or legitimate purpose, is a hallmark of malware, likely aiming for stealthy code execution, persistence, or payload delivery."
