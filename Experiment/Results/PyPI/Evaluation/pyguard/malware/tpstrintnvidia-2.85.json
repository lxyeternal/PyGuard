      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the command suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide the window is a known stealth technique. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name 'tpstrintnvidia' which does not correspond to any known legitimate package. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further indicate malicious intent or at least a suspicious source. The setup call is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, which is often used to hide failures during malicious installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, suspicious package metadata, and lack of legitimate user interaction strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with malware or a supply chain attack."
