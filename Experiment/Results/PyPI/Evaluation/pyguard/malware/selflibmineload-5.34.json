      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated (Base64-encoded UTF-16LE) and executed without user interaction or notification. The command references a suspicious GitHub URL (github.com/T4Hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe), indicating it likely downloads and executes a remote payload. The directory existence check for 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. This execution occurs during the setup process, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote code retrieval strongly indicates malicious intent."
