      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the flag CREATE_NO_WINDOW, which hides the window, indicating stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and outputs it to a file named '~\\WindowsCache.exe', then executes it. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and executes a payload from a remote server without user consent or notification. The presence of the suspicious domain 'esquelesquad.rip' in the comment and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The use of try/except to silently ignore errors also indicates an attempt to evade detection or prevent interruption. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a potentially malicious executable during package installation, which is a hallmark of malware."
