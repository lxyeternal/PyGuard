      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the use of a hidden PowerShell window strongly indicate stealthy, potentially malicious behavior. Additionally, the package metadata references 'EsqueleSquad' and an email address 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which along with the obfuscated PowerShell command and the suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) suggest malicious intent. The setup() call appears benign but is likely a cover or part of a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth execution flags, and suspicious naming conventions is a strong indicator of malicious behavior."
