      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The package name 'reqirements' is suspiciously similar to 'requirements' (a common typo-squatting tactic). The obfuscated class name and the use of encrypted code executed during installation strongly indicate a supply chain attack vector. The code attempts to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further payload delivery. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the use of network-related modules (requests) inside the decrypted payload suggests potential network communication or data exfiltration. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
