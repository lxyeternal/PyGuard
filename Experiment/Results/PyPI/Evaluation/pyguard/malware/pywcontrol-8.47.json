      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command, which is obfuscated via base64 encoding to hide its intent. This pattern—obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup—is a hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy payload delivery, persistence, or further malicious actions. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered automatically during import or setup strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery. There is no user interaction or notification, and the obfuscation prevents easy analysis of the payload, which is consistent with malicious intent."
