      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of a Base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, often used by malware for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or staging technique. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. These behaviors align strongly with multiple critical risk indicators of malicious activity, including obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during package installation, with no legitimate user interaction or business logic present."
