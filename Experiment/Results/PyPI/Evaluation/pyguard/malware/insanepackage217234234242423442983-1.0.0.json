      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that overrides the standard install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The package name is suspicious and nonsensical, and the description and long description are obfuscated strings, which further indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent. Executing arbitrary decrypted code during installation without user consent or validation is a critical risk and strongly indicative of malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
