      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or performing system modifications. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during package setup is a classic hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks or post-installation payload delivery. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup, further indicating an attempt to hide malicious activity within a seemingly benign package installation script."
