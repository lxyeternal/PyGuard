      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes during the package setup phase, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. Specifically, the read_version() function performs several suspicious actions: it spawns a subprocess running a script named 'version' located alongside the package, which is unusual and potentially malicious. It then collects detailed environment information including the hostname, system details, current working directory, and network interface information (via 'ifconfig' command output). This collected data is base64-encoded and sent via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://1.15.77.2/v/). This sequence of environment reconnaissance and automated data exfiltration without user consent or legitimate purpose is a hallmark of malicious behavior. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the transmitted data further supports this assessment. Additionally, the network communication occurs silently during package installation, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying these actions. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious intent related to unauthorized data collection and exfiltration during package installation."
