      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the intent and execution of potentially harmful commands. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which when decoded reveals a PowerShell invocation of a web request to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and executes a file named WindowsCache.exe, indicating a download and execution of a potentially malicious payload. The directory existence check for 'tahg' before launching the process suggests an evasion or staging technique. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name 'selfosinturlre' with a package author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which is uncommon for legitimate packages. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and downloading/executing an external executable strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with malware behavior, such as remote code execution, payload delivery, or persistence mechanisms."
