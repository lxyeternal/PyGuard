      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class GruppeInstall that overrides the install command in setuptools. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscated encrypted data and execution during install time is a known supply chain attack vector. Additionally, the package name and metadata appear suspicious and obfuscated, further supporting malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for executing decrypted code during installation, especially without user notification or validation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with malware that executes hidden payloads during package installation."
