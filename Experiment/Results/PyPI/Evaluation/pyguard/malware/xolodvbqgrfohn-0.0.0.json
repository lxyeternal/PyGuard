      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is highly obfuscated and uses base64 encoding to conceal its true functionality. It imports base64 and immediately executes a large base64-decoded payload using exec(). This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the actual code from static analysis and executes it dynamically. The decoded payload is extremely large and appears to contain multiple layers of obfuscation and encoded data, which is typical of malware attempting to evade detection. The use of exec on decoded data without any validation or user interaction is a hallmark of malicious code, often used to deliver payloads, steal data, or perform unauthorized actions. Given the extensive obfuscation, immediate execution of decoded content, and lack of any benign context or user consent, this code is almost certainly malicious."
