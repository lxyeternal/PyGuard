      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (Base64 encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only if it does not exist, it executes the PowerShell command. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads or performs unauthorized actions. This pattern of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name 'tppyintgame' further support the malicious intent. The code attempts to hide its activity by suppressing errors with try/except and running the command silently. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during package installation, which is a high-risk malicious behavior."
