      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a JAR file from a hardcoded external URL (https://www.mediafire.com/file/9frt7p6z242t7q4/dcbot_3.jar) and writes it directly into the Windows Startup folder under the user's APPDATA directory. This ensures persistence by causing the JAR to execute automatically on user login. Immediately after writing the file, the code executes the JAR using a subprocess call to 'java -jar' in the Startup directory, running the downloaded code without any user interaction, consent, or validation. This pattern of downloading an executable payload from an untrusted remote source, placing it in a system startup location, and executing it silently is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, enabling persistence, remote code execution, and potential further compromise. There is no indication of legitimate business logic, user notification, or security checks, making this code strongly indicative of malicious intent."
