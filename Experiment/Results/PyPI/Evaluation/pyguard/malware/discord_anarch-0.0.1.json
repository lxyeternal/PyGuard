      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a class 'Nuker' that uses a Discord authorization token to perform destructive actions on Discord servers, such as banning members, kicking members, deleting channels, creating channels, and creating webhooks via direct Discord API HTTP requests. The most critical malicious behavior is in the 'init_nuker' class method, which writes a Python script ('startup.py') into the Windows Startup folder of the current user by downloading it from a remote Discord CDN URL. It then immediately executes this script in a new thread without user consent or notification. This behavior enables persistence by running potentially malicious code on system startup. The combination of downloading and executing remote code silently, writing to a system startup directory, and performing destructive operations on Discord servers strongly indicates malicious intent. The code lacks any legitimate user interaction, validation, or safeguards, and the use of direct HTTP requests with authorization tokens to ban/kick/delete resources further confirms its malicious nature."
