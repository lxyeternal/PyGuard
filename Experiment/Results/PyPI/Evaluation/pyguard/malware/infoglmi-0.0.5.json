      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a binary file named 'node' from a suspicious external URL (https://github-bebra.s3.filebase.com/node) and writes it to the /tmp directory without any user interaction or consent. It also writes a configuration file 'config.json' with mining pool details pointing to an IP address (144.76.245.112:22221) commonly associated with cryptocurrency mining. Then, it changes the permissions of the downloaded binary to executable and runs it immediately. This sequence of downloading an executable from an untrusted source, writing it to a temporary directory, and executing it without validation or user notification is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically cryptocurrency mining malware or a remote code execution payload. Additionally, this code is executed automatically during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of hardcoded suspicious URLs, network retrieval of executable code, file writes to /tmp, and immediate execution without validation or user consent strongly indicates malicious intent."
