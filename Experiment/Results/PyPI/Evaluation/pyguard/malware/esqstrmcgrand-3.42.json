      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates stealthy execution without user notification. Additionally, the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the package metadata author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The setup call appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except pass block, which suppresses errors and may be used to hide malicious activity during installation. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script, stealth process spawning, and conditional execution strongly indicate malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware payload delivery."
