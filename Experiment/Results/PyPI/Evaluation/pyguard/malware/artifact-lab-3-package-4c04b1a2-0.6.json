      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a Python package setup script that hooks into the package installation and development commands (install and develop). Upon running these commands, it executes the function 'notmalfunc' which collects all environment variables from the host system and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (an ngrok.app domain). This behavior constitutes silent collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data without user consent or notification. The use of setuptools install hooks to automatically run this data exfiltration during package installation or development is a known supply chain attack vector. The hardcoded external endpoint, lack of user interaction, and automated network transmission of environment variables are strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with credential or information stealing malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
