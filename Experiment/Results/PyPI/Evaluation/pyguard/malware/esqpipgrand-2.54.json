      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a strong indicator of stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, a hallmark of malicious behavior. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated detection or to stage payloads. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with encoded commands strongly suggests malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
