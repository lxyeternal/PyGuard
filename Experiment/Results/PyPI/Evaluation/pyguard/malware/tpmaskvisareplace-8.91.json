      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a typical malware evasion tactic. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated infection or detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raises suspicion. The rest of the code is a standard setup call for a package with a suspicious name 'tpmaskvisareplace' and author 'EsqueleSquad', which may be a disguise or part of a supply chain attack. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup, lack of user interaction, and obfuscation strongly indicates malicious intent."
