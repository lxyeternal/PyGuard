      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary decrypted code during package installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large encrypted payload and immediately executes it with exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The use of obfuscated encrypted payloads, execution without user consent or interaction, and execution triggered automatically during installation strongly indicate malicious intent. The package name and metadata are suspicious and meaningless, further supporting this conclusion. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code runs hidden, potentially downloading or executing further malicious payloads. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and abuse of Python package installation hooks."
