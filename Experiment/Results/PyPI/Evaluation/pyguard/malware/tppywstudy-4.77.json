      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated detection or analysis. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, further indicating stealthy execution. Additionally, the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest suspicious or attacker-controlled identifiers. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is benign by itself, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution during import or setup is a classic supply chain attack pattern. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated base64-encoded command execution, spawning PowerShell in hidden mode, and execution during package setup/install time without user interaction or consent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
