      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command and the immediate execution of this command in a hidden manner is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code is a setup script that appears benign, but the presence of this obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during the package setup or import phase is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious payload delivery. Therefore, this code is malicious."
