      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of an obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell command executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, this execution occurs during the package setup phase, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the setup code appears benign, but the hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell command during installation is a critical risk and hallmark of malware."
