      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, imports a module named 'testjsonn1' and calls its 'main' function with a hardcoded URL pointing to a remote Python script hosted on a Discord CDN URL, saving it as 'testnp.py'. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious behavior because it executes code during installation from an untrusted, external source without user consent or validation. The use of a custom install command to fetch and potentially execute remote code is a known supply chain attack vector. The URL is not a standard or trusted package repository but a Discord CDN link, which is suspicious. This behavior enables remote code execution on the victim's system during package installation, which is a critical security risk. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a remote URL and saves it locally, then immediately executes it using subprocess.run with 'pythonw', which runs the script in a hidden window without user interaction or notification. This pattern of downloading and executing arbitrary code from a remote source without validation or user consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The code automates retrieval and execution of potentially untrusted code, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. There is no evidence of user prompts, integrity checks, or sandboxing, which increases the risk. Such behavior is commonly observed in malware samples that propagate or execute payloads dynamically."
