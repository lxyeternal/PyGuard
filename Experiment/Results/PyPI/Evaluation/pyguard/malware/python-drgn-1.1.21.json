      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command, causing it to execute automatically during package installation. It collects sensitive system information such as OS details (via 'uname -a' or 'systeminfo'), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP address (via 'curl ifconfig.me'), current user ('whoami'), and hostname. It then sends all this collected information in a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of sensitive environment and user data without user consent or notification. The use of shell commands to gather system info combined with immediate network transmission to an external, hardcoded endpoint during package installation is a classic hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this behavior, and the hardcoded webhook URL strongly indicates attacker-controlled infrastructure. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
