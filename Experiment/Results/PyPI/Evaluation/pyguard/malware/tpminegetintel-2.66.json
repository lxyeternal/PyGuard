      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the use of a non-standard package name ('tpminegetintel') with an author email linked to 'EsqueleSquad' (a known threat actor group) further supports malicious intent. The encoded PowerShell command references a URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) which appears to be a remote payload download and execution attempt. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery on the victim system. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors and avoid detection also indicates malicious stealth behavior."
