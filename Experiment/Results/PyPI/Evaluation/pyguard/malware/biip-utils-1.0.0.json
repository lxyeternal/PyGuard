      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code via exec(). The encrypted payload is decrypted using a Fernet key and then executed immediately during package installation. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where arbitrary code execution occurs silently during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload and exec() to run decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the code being executed. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks but instead runs hidden code on the user's system, which can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks in Python packages."
