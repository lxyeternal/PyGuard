      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution, the use of a hidden PowerShell window, and the encoded command strongly indicate malicious intent. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name ('py-intelhackedpyw'), which may be typosquatting or designed to appear legitimate. The overall pattern matches known malware behaviors such as stealthy code execution during package installation, obfuscation via base64 encoding, and use of PowerShell for potentially harmful actions. Therefore, this code is malicious."
