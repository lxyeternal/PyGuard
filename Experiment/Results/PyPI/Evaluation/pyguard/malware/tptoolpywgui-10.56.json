      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated in base64 UTF-16LE format, which is a common method to hide malicious intent. The command references a suspicious GitHub URL (https://github.com/T4Hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and attempts to invoke a web request to download or execute a payload silently without user interaction or notification. The presence of this behavior in a setup script (commonly executed during package installation) indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed automatically during installation. The directory existence check for 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. These factors combined—obfuscated PowerShell command execution, hidden process spawning, remote payload retrieval from a suspicious URL, and execution during package setup—are strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with malware patterns."
