      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the 'Hidden' window style and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely contains obfuscated instructions, which is a hallmark of malware attempting to evade detection. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which may be used as a marker to avoid repeated execution or detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. This pattern—executing obfuscated PowerShell commands in hidden mode during package setup—is a known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware."
