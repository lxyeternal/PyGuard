      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification, and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide its execution. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and a path that appears to be used for downloading or executing further payloads. This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a hidden window is a well-known technique used by malware for stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading additional malicious payloads. Additionally, the code attempts to execute this payload conditionally based on the absence of a directory named 'tahg', which is a common evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during the setup phase strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malicious package installation behavior."
