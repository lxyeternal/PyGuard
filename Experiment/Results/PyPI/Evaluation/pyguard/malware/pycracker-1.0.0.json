      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation techniques including base64 encoding, zlib compression, and character code transformations to hide its true intent. The code dynamically decodes and decompresses a payload and immediately executes it using eval and exec, which is a classic hallmark of malware attempting to conceal and run arbitrary code. The obfuscated strings and lambda functions are designed to evade static analysis. The code also sets attributes on built-in modules and executes code that appears to be dynamically generated at runtime. There is no legitimate user interaction or business logic, and the code is structured to run hidden, obfuscated payloads. Such patterns are strongly associated with malware, including remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
