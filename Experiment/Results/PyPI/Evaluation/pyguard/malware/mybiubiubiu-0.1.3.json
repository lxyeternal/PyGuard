      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information such as the current username, hostname, and public IP address by making an HTTP GET request to a third-party service (https://enabledns.com/ip). It then packages this information into a JSON object and silently sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://123.206.22.33:5000/p/). This exfiltration of user and system data occurs automatically upon execution without any user interaction or consent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a Python package setup script, which means this data collection and exfiltration will happen during package installation, a known vector for supply chain attacks. Although some potentially suspicious code sections (e.g., file writing, webbrowser opening) are commented out, the active code still performs unauthorized data collection and transmission to an attacker-controlled server. This behavior aligns with typical malicious patterns such as environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration during package installation, which are strong indicators of malware."
