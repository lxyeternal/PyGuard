      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, as indicated by the suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated command. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is used here as a cover to execute the malicious payload during installation. There is no user interaction or notification, and the code suppresses exceptions to avoid raising errors that might alert the user. All these factors combined confirm that the code is malicious."
