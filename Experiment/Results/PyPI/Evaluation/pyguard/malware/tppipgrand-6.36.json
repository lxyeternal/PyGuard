      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially involving remote code execution or downloading/executing further payloads. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command are classic malware traits. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a non-standard package name, which may be typosquatting or used to disguise malicious intent. The code runs this malicious payload automatically during setup without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code is malicious."
