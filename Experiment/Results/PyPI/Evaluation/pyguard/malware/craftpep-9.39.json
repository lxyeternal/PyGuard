      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches PowerShell with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an -EncodedCommand parameter. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell command, which is a well-known obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated execution or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates an attempt to run the command stealthily without user notification or visible windows. This pattern—executing an obfuscated PowerShell command in hidden mode during package setup—is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, often used in supply chain attacks to execute unauthorized code on the victim's system during package installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
