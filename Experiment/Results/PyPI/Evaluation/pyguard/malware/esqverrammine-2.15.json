      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip and the encoded command referencing a suspicious domain 'cdn.discordapp.com' with a path that looks like an attachment). This pattern of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote code execution during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package with suspicious author and package names, which is typical for malicious packages attempting to disguise themselves as legitimate libraries. Therefore, this code is malicious."
