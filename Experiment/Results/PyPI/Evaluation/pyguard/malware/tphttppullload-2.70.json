      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an attempt to avoid repeated execution or detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (cdnd.discordapp.com/attachments/...), which is a known pattern for malware delivery. This behavior is typical of supply chain attacks or malware that executes arbitrary code during package installation, leveraging the setup script to run hidden, obfuscated commands. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command and the execution of this command during the setup process without user consent or transparency is a hallmark of malicious intent."
