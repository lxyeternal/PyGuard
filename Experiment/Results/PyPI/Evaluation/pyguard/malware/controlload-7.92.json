      "malicious_behavior": "The code spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This behavior is embedded in a try-except block without any user notification or consent, and it executes automatically during the setup process of a Python package, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can be used to download and execute further payloads, escalate privileges, or establish persistence. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
