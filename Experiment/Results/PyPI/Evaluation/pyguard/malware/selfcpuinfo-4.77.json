      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which when decoded reveals a PowerShell invocation of Invoke-WebRequest to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and save it as ~\\WindowsCache.exe, then execute it. The use of a hidden window suppresses user notification, and the URL points to a potentially malicious executable hosted on Dropbox, which is a common tactic for malware payload delivery. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated infection or detection. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during the import or setup phase is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or malicious package installation behavior. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, downloading and executing remote payloads without user consent, and use of suspicious URLs. Therefore, this code is malicious."
