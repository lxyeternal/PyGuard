      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware (infostealer). It collects extensive sensitive user data including system information (username, computer name, Windows key, hardware ID, IP address, geolocation), browser data (passwords, cookies, history, credit card info), Discord tokens, Minecraft and Roblox data, and clipboard contents. It decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows APIs and AES decryption, indicating intent to extract protected credentials. The code exfiltrates this data to attacker-controlled endpoints via HTTP POST requests to hardcoded suspicious URLs (e.g., https://kekwltd.ru/relay/bluescreen). It also includes clipboard hijacking functionality that replaces cryptocurrency wallet addresses with attacker-controlled addresses, a known theft technique. The code attempts to evade detection by killing processes related to debugging, virtual machines, and Discord token protection, and by hiding execution and running in background threads. It installs numerous Python packages silently and uses obfuscated variable and function names. The code copies itself to the Windows startup folder for persistence and deletes temporary files after exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded attacker webhook URLs, extensive credential harvesting, stealth techniques, and automated data exfiltration without user consent or notification confirms this code is malicious."
