      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is executed with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which hides the window, a typical stealth technique. This behavior is executed automatically during the setup script execution, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code runs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands, hidden execution, and conditional checks strongly indicates malicious intent, likely for executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise. The rest of the setup code appears normal but is overshadowed by this stealthy and obfuscated code execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
