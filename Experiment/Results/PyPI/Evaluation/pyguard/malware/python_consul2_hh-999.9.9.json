      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools commands that hook into the package installation, development, and egg_info phases to automatically execute the function 'custom_command'. This function collects sensitive environment information including the package name, the hostname of the machine, the current user login name, and the current working directory. It then serializes this data into JSON, encodes it as a hex string, splits it into chunks, and sends these chunks as DNS queries to a suspicious, hardcoded domain 'for-research.ru' via a custom DNS request function. This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and user information without user consent or notification, triggered automatically during package installation or development setup. Such use of installation hooks to stealthily gather and exfiltrate environment data to an external, attacker-controlled domain is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The domain and package name appear suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate functionality. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and network communication. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with credential or environment data theft and exfiltration during package installation."
