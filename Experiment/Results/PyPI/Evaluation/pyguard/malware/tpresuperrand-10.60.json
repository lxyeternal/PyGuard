      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding, hiding its true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or ensure persistence. The use of subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The presence of a suspicious comment with a non-standard URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a malicious or attacker-controlled source. The setup call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. These characteristics align with known malware patterns such as obfuscated code execution during package installation, stealthy background execution, and potential for further payload delivery or system compromise."
