      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains strong indicators of malicious behavior. It includes heavy obfuscation techniques such as multiple layers of base64 decoding, base32 decoding, zlib decompression, and decryption using the cryptography.fernet module. The code dynamically decrypts and decompresses a large encoded payload and then executes it using exec on deserialized bytecode, which is a classic method used by malware to hide its true functionality and evade static analysis. The presence of a hardcoded Fernet key (__mikey__) and a large hex-encoded data blob (__step1__) that is decrypted and decoded before execution further confirms this. Additionally, the code imports marshal and uses it to load and execute code objects dynamically, which is uncommon in benign software and typical in malware for executing hidden payloads. The initial functions with meaningless names and unreachable conditions appear to be decoys or obfuscation noise. The overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated code execution, dynamic code loading, and execution of decrypted payloads without user interaction or consent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
