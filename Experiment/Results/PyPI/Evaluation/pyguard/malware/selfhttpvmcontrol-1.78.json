      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing easy inspection of its intent, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, suggesting a persistence or evasion mechanism. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious domain in a comment, which may be linked to attacker infrastructure. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and lack of user interaction or notification strongly indicates this code is designed to execute malicious payloads covertly during package installation or execution."
