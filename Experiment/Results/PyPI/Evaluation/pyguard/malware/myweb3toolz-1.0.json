      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects Steam-related files (ssfn files and config directory contents) from the user's Program Files (x86) Steam folder without user consent. It archives these files into a zip file in the TEMP directory and then silently uploads this archive to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an attacker-controlled external endpoint. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive user information (Steam session files), which is a hallmark of credential-stealing or information-stealing malware. The code performs these actions automatically without any user interaction or notification, uses a hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration, and deletes the temporary archive file afterward to cover tracks. These factors strongly indicate malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code silently copies the entire contents of a directory named 'Exodus' from the user's AppData\\Roaming folder (which is typically used by applications to store user data) to a temporary location, compresses it into a zip archive, and then uploads this archive to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to delete the created zip file and copied directory afterward, which is a common evasion technique to remove traces. There is no legitimate user interaction or business logic justifying this automated data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with data theft or credential stealing malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports multiple modules with suspicious names such as 'metamask', 'discord', 'exodus', 'machine', 'screenshot', and 'telegram', which are commonly associated with credential stealing or token extraction malware. The functions called (yea(), find_tokens(), runner(), machineinfo(), sikrinsat(), telegram()) suggest activities like extracting tokens (likely Discord tokens), gathering machine information, taking screenshots, and sending data via Telegram, all typical behaviors of information-stealing malware. The code attempts to import 'myweb3toolz.passwords_cards_cookies', which implies extraction of passwords, cards, and cookies, further indicating credential theft. The use of multiple try/except blocks suppresses errors, which is a common evasion technique. Finally, the entire malicious sequence is executed in a background thread immediately upon import or execution, without any user interaction or notification, which is a hallmark of stealthy malware. Taken together, these factors strongly indicate that the code is designed for malicious purposes, specifically for stealing sensitive user data and exfiltrating it covertly."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects Discord authentication tokens from various local application data directories associated with Discord clients and multiple browsers by scanning LevelDB local storage files. It uses regex patterns to extract tokens that can be used to authenticate as the user. The collected tokens are then sent via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an attacker-controlled endpoint. This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential theft and data exfiltration without user consent. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL, scanning of sensitive user data directories, extraction of authentication tokens, and automated network exfiltration are strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with credential-stealing malware."

It copies these directories to a temporary folder, archives them into a zip file, and then silently sends the archive via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive user information (cryptocurrency wallet data) without user consent or notification. The use of hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URL for data exfiltration, targeting of browser extension data directories, and automated network transmission without user interaction are strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with credential or wallet-stealing malware."

This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive user information. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for silent data transmission, combined with the lack of any legitimate user notification or purpose, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code also deletes the temporary screenshot file after sending, which is a common evasion technique to reduce forensic evidence. Overall, this pattern matches known malicious behaviors related to covert data exfiltration and privacy violation."

This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user credentials or session information without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration, combined with the automated collection and transmission of private user data, is a strong indicator of malicious intent consistent with credential-stealing malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a clear example of malicious behavior, specifically a credential stealer targeting multiple Chromium-based browsers on Windows. It enumerates installed browsers by checking known local app data paths, then accesses each browser's 'Local State' file to extract the encrypted master key used for encrypting saved passwords, cookies, and credit card data. It uses Windows API (win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData) to decrypt this master key, then decrypts stored passwords, cookies, credit card numbers, browsing history, and download history from the browser's SQLite databases. The stolen data is saved temporarily in the user's AppData Local Temp directory, then compressed into a zip archive. Finally, the archive is exfiltrated by uploading it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is attacker-controlled infrastructure. The code performs all these actions silently without user consent or notification, uses no legitimate business logic, and deletes temporary files after exfiltration to cover tracks. The presence of hardcoded webhook, use of Windows cryptographic API to decrypt sensitive credentials, extraction of multiple types of private user data, and automated exfiltration to an external server are all hallmark indicators of malicious credential-stealing malware. This behavior is consistent with known information-stealing trojans that harvest browser-stored credentials and send them to attackers. Therefore, this code is malicious."

It then packages this sensitive information into a JSON payload and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an attacker-controlled external endpoint. This behavior constitutes automated data exfiltration of potentially sensitive system identifiers and network information. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL, the silent collection of hardware and network identifiers, and the immediate transmission of this data to an external server are strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance tools used in attacks. There is no legitimate user notification, consent, or business logic justifying this data collection and exfiltration, making the code malicious."
