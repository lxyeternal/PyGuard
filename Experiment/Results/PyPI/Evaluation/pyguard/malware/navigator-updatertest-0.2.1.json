      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install process and, upon installation, collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (https://ccqvib15v50h42949ip0kzxgeyonaaege.oast.pro), which is not a known or trusted endpoint. This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and user information without user consent or legitimate purpose. The use of a custom install hook to execute network communication during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. Based on the provided knowledge points, this pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent, specifically data exfiltration and supply chain compromise."
