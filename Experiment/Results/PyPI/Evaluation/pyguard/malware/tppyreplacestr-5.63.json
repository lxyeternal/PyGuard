      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed in hidden mode is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, often used for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading and executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The setup function appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except block, possibly to suppress errors and hide malicious activity during package installation. The author and email fields and the commented URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and lack of legitimate user interaction strongly indicates malicious intent."
