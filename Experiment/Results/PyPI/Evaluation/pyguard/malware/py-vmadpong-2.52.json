      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed during the setup script execution is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading and executing further payloads. The directory existence check for 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The use of an encoded PowerShell command string to hide intent, combined with execution during package setup, strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery. There is no legitimate reason for such obfuscated, hidden execution in a setup script, and the author and email fields appear suspicious and unrelated to any known benign package. Therefore, this code is malicious."
