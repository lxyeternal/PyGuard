      "malicious_behavior": "The code hooks into setuptools installation commands (install, develop, egg_info) to automatically execute a custom function during package installation or development setup. This function collects sensitive environment information including the package name, the hostname of the machine, the current user name, and the current working directory. It then serializes this data into JSON, encodes it as a hex string, splits it into chunks, and sends these chunks as DNS queries to a suspicious, attacker-controlled domain ('uchpuchmak.lol') via a custom DNS request function. This behavior constitutes automated, silent exfiltration of system and user information without user consent or notification, triggered during package installation. Such use of installation hooks to collect and exfiltrate environment data to an external domain is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malicious intent. The domain used is non-standard and attacker-controlled, and the data exfiltration via DNS queries is a known covert channel technique to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
