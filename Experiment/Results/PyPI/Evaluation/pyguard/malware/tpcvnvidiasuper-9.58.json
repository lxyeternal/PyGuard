      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it executes the encoded PowerShell command. The presence of a suspicious hardcoded URL in a comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated PowerShell command strongly indicate an attempt to stealthily execute potentially harmful or unauthorized code. This pattern—base64 encoding combined with spawning a hidden PowerShell process—is a well-known hallmark of malware used for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, or persistence. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further suggests an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious Python code."
