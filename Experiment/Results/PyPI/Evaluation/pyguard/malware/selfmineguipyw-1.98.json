      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style set to hidden and uses subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, which is a stealth technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is executed before this, during import or setup execution. This pattern—executing obfuscated PowerShell commands in hidden mode during package setup—is a known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
