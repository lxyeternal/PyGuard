      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands, and it is executed silently without user interaction or notification. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest suspicious or attacker-controlled identifiers. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation. The presence of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent, as legitimate setup scripts rarely execute hidden shell commands, especially encoded PowerShell commands that contact or manipulate external resources. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and potential for further payload execution or system compromise."
