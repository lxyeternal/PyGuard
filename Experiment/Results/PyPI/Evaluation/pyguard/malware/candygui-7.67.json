      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the directory existence check ('tahg') before launching the PowerShell command suggests an attempt to avoid repeated execution or detection. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command, combined with silent execution, is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. These factors collectively indicate that the code is malicious."
