      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated variable names and an obfuscated string (wopvEaTEcopFEavc) that is XOR-decoded with a numeric string (iOpvEoeaaeavocp) to produce executable code dynamically. This decoded code is then executed immediately using eval(compile(...)), which is a classic technique for hiding malicious payloads. Furthermore, after executing the decoded code, the script deletes itself using os.remove(os.path.abspath(__file__)), which is a common self-deletion technique used by malware to evade detection and forensic analysis. The lack of any user interaction, the use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and self-deletion are all strong indicators of malicious intent. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious."
