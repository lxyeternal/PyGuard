      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to run additional code during package installation. Specifically, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and user information without user consent or legitimate purpose. The use of a custom install hook to perform network communication during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector. The hardcoded external URL is attacker-controlled infrastructure commonly used for reconnaissance or data collection. There is no benign justification for this pattern in setup scripts, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including environment discovery, data exfiltration, and abuse of package installation hooks. Therefore, this code is malicious."
