      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before launching the hidden PowerShell process, combined with the use of an encoded PowerShell command, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the package metadata with unusual author and package names further support the suspicion of a supply chain attack or malware disguised as a Python package. The setup() call itself appears benign, but the hidden execution of obfuscated PowerShell code during import or setup is a classic malware behavior pattern, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or payload delivery."
