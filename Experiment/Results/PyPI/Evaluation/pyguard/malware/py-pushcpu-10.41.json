      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The presence of a suspicious comment with a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raises suspicion. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious behavior is triggered automatically during import or execution, without user interaction or consent. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup or install is a known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
