      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, IP address, and username without any user interaction or consent. It then automatically sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (a non-standard domain under oastify.com, which is commonly used for testing or attacker-controlled endpoints). This pattern of silent environment discovery and automated data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with credential-stealing or reconnaissance malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the external endpoint is not a known trusted service, which further supports the classification as malicious."
