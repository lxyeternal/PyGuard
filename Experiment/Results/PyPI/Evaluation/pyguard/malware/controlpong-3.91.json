      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to avoid user visibility, which is a typical stealth technique. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup (distutils setup) strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior. There is no legitimate reason for such obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution in a setup script, and it matches known malware patterns for stealthy code execution and potential payload delivery or system compromise."
