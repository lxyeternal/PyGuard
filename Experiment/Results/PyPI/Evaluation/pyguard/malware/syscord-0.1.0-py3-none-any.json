      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation techniques including base64 encoding and decoding of large code blocks, which are then dynamically executed via eval and compile. The code imports modules commonly used in malware such as subprocess, threading, requests, and browser_cookie3, and it collects sensitive user information including usernames, emails, environment variables, and browser cookies. It constructs and sends HTTP requests to hardcoded suspicious URLs (e.g., discordapp.com API endpoints and other obfuscated domains), indicating data exfiltration. The code writes files to system and user directories, including Startup folders, and executes shell commands with obfuscated PowerShell payloads in hidden windows, a known stealth technique. It also spawns threads to execute payloads conditionally based on environment checks, which is typical for evasion and persistence. The presence of functions that decrypt and immediately execute code, combined with network communication to attacker-controlled servers, confirms this is a credential-stealing and remote code execution malware. The code also abuses Python package installation hooks to run malicious code during install, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily collect sensitive data, exfiltrate it, and execute arbitrary code from remote sources without user consent or interaction, fulfilling multiple criteria of high-risk malicious software."
