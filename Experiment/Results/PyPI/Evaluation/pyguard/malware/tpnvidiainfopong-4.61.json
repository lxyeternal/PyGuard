      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'Windo​wsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. This behavior is a classic indicator of malicious activity, specifically a stealthy payload download and execution, which is typical of malware or a supply chain attack. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a package name ('tpnvidiainfopong') that appears to be a typosquat or misleading. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process creation, and remote payload retrieval strongly indicates malicious intent."
