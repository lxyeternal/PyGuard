      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://kekwltd.ru/kekwltd.exe) and saves it into a user-specific system directory (APPDATA\\Microsoft) without any user interaction or consent. Immediately after downloading, it attempts to execute the downloaded file using subprocess.call with the 'start' command, which launches the executable. This sequence—fetching a binary from an untrusted remote source, writing it to a system or user directory, and executing it silently—is a classic and strong indicator of malicious behavior. There is no validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic present. The domain and filename are suspicious and not associated with known legitimate software. This pattern is a well-known malware technique for payload delivery, persistence, or system compromise."
