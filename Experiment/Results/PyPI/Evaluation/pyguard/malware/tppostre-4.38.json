      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window, CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag), which is a well-known technique used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary code without user consent or notification. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests a conditional execution to avoid repeated or unwanted runs. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name ('tppostre') with an author email unrelated to any known legitimate source further raise suspicion. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is triggered automatically during import or execution, which is a common supply chain attack vector. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and suspicious naming conventions confirms that this code is malicious."
