      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The use of obfuscated encrypted data and dynamic execution during installation strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation. The package name and metadata are suspicious and nonsensical, further supporting malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code executes potentially harmful code silently during install, which is a critical risk indicator of malware."
