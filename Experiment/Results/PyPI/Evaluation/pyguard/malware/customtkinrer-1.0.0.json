      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during installation strongly indicate a supply chain attack vector. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks but instead runs hidden code, which could perform arbitrary malicious actions on the victim's system. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
