      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive sensitive system information without user consent, including the contents of /etc/passwd, environment variables, current directory listing, contents of a local file logger.py, /etc/hosts, running processes, and files under the user's home directory and /rasp directory. It then serializes this data into JSON, encodes it with base64, and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded IP address (151.101.128.223) with a spoofed Host header. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being exfiltrated, combined with the silent collection of sensitive files and environment data, and the transmission to a suspicious external server without any user interaction or notification, are strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern matches known malware techniques for information stealing and data exfiltration. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent evident, and the code attempts to bypass SSL verification to avoid detection. Therefore, this code is malicious."
