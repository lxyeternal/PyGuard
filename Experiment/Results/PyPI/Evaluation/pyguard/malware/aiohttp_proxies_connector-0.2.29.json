      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing and remote code execution malware. Key malicious characteristics include: 1) The code writes base64-decoded Python scripts ('main.cpython-39.py' and 'scripts.cpython-39.py') into a hidden temporary directory under the user's AppData local temp path, then executes them in hidden subprocesses without user interaction or consent. 2) The decoded payloads contain obfuscated code that collects sensitive user data such as browser cookies (via browser_cookie3), user login information, and environment details, then exfiltrates this data to suspicious external servers using HTTP POST requests to hardcoded URLs and IP addresses. 3) The code uses subprocess.Popen with flags to hide windows and suppress output, evading detection. 4) It performs environment reconnaissance by enumerating user directories, local app data, roaming profiles, documents, downloads, and startup folders, copying and packaging files for exfiltration. 5) The installation hook triggers this behavior automatically during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. 6) The presence of obfuscated function and variable names, base64 encoding, and dynamic execution of decoded payloads further confirms intent to conceal malicious activity. 7) The code attempts to create and delete files and directories in user and system paths, indicating persistence or cleanup behavior. 8) Network communication is made to non-standard, suspicious domains and IP addresses, including pythonanywhere.com and a specific IP with port 9090, which are not related to the legitimate package. 9) The code imports modules commonly used in malware (e.g., pyperclip, threading, requests, browser_cookie3) and uses them to steal credentials and system information. 10) The overall structure and behavior match known malware patterns such as automated data collection, exfiltration, stealth execution, and remote code execution during package installation. Based on these observations and the extensive knowledge points provided, this code is conclusively malicious."
