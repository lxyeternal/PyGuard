      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of an obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell command executed silently is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The directory existence check for 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially as it is embedded in a setup script, which can be used as a supply chain attack vector to execute arbitrary code during package installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands is a critical risk indicator of malware."
