      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of an obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell command executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, this execution occurs during the import/setup phase, which is typical of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation or initialization. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try/except block, likely to mask errors and avoid detection. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window triggered automatically without user consent classifies this code as malicious."
