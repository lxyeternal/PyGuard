      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Inside this method, it checks if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded string and decrypted at runtime, then executed immediately without any user interaction or validation. This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated, encrypted payloads executed during installation, combined with network-related imports (requests) and execution of arbitrary code, strongly indicates malicious intent. The package name and metadata are nonsensical and likely designed to evade detection. Overall, this code enables remote code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, which is a critical security risk and a known malware technique."
