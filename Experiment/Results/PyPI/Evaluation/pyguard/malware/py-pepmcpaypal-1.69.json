      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the 'Hidden' window style and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking a web request to a suspicious domain (noted in the comment as www.esquelesquad.rip) or executing further payloads. This behavior is typical of malware that uses obfuscation (base64 encoding) and hidden execution to deliver or execute malicious payloads without user consent. Additionally, the presence of this code in a setup script (distutils.core.setup) suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation. The package name 'py-pepmcpaypal' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' do not correspond to known legitimate packages, increasing suspicion. The try/except blocks suppress errors, which is a common evasion technique. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
