      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or unnecessary runs. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a known technique for executing obfuscated payloads, potentially for persistence, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further malicious code. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means the malicious payload executes automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears normal but is wrapped in a try/except that suppresses errors, which may be used to hide failures in malicious code execution. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
