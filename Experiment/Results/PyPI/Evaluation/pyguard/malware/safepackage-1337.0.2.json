      "malicious_behavior": "The code is malicious because it attempts to stealthily steal user credentials by prompting for passwords on different operating systems using native GUI password dialogs or PowerShell credential prompts, without legitimate user consent or notification. It adapts its behavior based on the detected OS and user privileges, avoiding root/administrator accounts. The stolen credentials are then exfiltrated via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://en0w6ukj0qarx.x.pipedream.net/), which is a known endpoint for capturing data in attacker-controlled environments. The code uses shell commands to invoke password prompts and reads their output directly, then sends this sensitive information over the network automatically. This combination of credential harvesting, environment-aware stealth techniques, and automated data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server is a hallmark of credential-stealing malware."
