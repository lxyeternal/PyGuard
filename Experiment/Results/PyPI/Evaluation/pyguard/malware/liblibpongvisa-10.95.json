      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a command that invokes 'Invoke-WebRequest' to download and execute a file named 'Esquele.exe' into a hidden window. This pattern of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell execution combined with downloading and running an executable from a non-official, suspicious URL is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for payload delivery, persistence, or remote code execution. Additionally, the code attempts to run this payload automatically during the setup process without user interaction or consent, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious PyPI packages. The presence of a suspicious package name ('liblibpongvisa') and author email ('tahgoficial@proton.me') further supports the malicious intent. The try/except blocks suppress errors, which is another evasion technique. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a potentially harmful payload on Windows systems during package installation."
