      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a Discord token stealer and exfiltrator. It searches for Discord and various Chromium-based browser data directories on a Windows system, reads encrypted Discord tokens from local storage files, decrypts them using the Windows CryptUnprotectData API and the Chrome master key, and then validates these tokens by querying Discord's API. For valid tokens, it collects sensitive user information including username, user ID, email, phone number, 2FA status, Nitro subscription status, and PC environment details such as IP address, username, and computer name. It then exfiltrates all this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user consent or notification. The use of base64 decoding combined with decryption of encrypted tokens, automated network requests to Discord APIs, and silent transmission of stolen credentials to an attacker-controlled webhook are hallmark malicious behaviors consistent with credential stealing malware. The code also uses subprocess calls to gather hardware UUID, further indicating environment fingerprinting. There is no legitimate or benign purpose for this automated collection and exfiltration of sensitive Discord tokens and user data, making this code definitively malicious."
