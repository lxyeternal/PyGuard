      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a Python package setup script that hijacks the installation process by overriding the setuptools install command to execute the function 'createfile' immediately upon installation. This function collects sensitive system information including OS details and the system uptime, as well as the local IP address. It then establishes a raw TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 9090 and sends this collected information without any user consent or notification. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The use of a hardcoded external IP for data transmission, the lack of any legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the execution of network communication during the install phase strongly indicate malicious intent."
