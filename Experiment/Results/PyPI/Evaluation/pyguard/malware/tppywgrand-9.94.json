      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a persistence or staging check. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name ('tppywgrand') authored by 'EsqueleSquad' further raise suspicion. The setup call appears to be a cover or decoy, while the real malicious action is the hidden PowerShell execution. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup, all of which are hallmark behaviors of malware, especially supply chain attacks or trojanized packages."
