      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing obfuscated code during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent. The obfuscation of class names and the use of encrypted payloads executed at install time are typical supply chain attack techniques. Additionally, the package name 'ettherium' appears suspicious and possibly typosquatted. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification before this code runs, and the decrypted code is not visible, preventing static analysis of its true intent. These factors combined strongly indicate that this code is malicious."
