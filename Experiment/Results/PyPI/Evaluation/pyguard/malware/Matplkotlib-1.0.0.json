      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The package name 'Matplkotlib' is a typo-squatted variant of the legitimate 'matplotlib' package, which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The obfuscated class name and the use of encrypted payload executed during installation strongly indicate an attempt to hide malicious code execution. The code also specifies installation requirements for 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used in the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated code, execution of decrypted code during package installation, use of a typo-squatted package name, and execution of arbitrary code without user consent, all of which confirm it is malicious."
