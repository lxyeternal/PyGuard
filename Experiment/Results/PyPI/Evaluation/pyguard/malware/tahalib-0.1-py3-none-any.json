      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive user credentials by accessing the Chrome browser's 'Login Data' SQLite database, decrypting stored passwords using Windows DPAPI and Chrome's AES encryption key, and writing these credentials (website URL, username, and decrypted password) to a local file named 'passwords.txt'. It then exfiltrates this file by sending it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an attacker-controlled external endpoint. This entire process occurs without any user interaction or consent, indicating covert data theft. The use of system APIs to decrypt Chrome passwords, combined with automated network transmission of stolen credentials to a remote server, matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, specifically credential theft and data exfiltration malware."
