      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the use of a non-standard domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) further indicate malicious intent. Additionally, the setup() call uses a suspicious package name ('esqpywloadmask') and author email ('tahgoficial@proton.me'), which are not typical for legitimate packages. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process creation, and suspicious package metadata strongly indicates that this code is designed to execute malicious payloads stealthily, consistent with supply chain attack or malware installation behavior."
