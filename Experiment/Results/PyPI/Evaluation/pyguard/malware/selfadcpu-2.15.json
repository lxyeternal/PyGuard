      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This obfuscation technique (base64-encoded PowerShell command) is a well-known method to hide the true intent of the command and evade detection. The command is executed silently (hidden window) without user interaction or notification. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name ('selfadcpu' by 'EsqueleSquad') further raise suspicion. The rest of the code is a typical setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask the malicious payload during installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, and lack of legitimate user interaction or business logic strongly indicates malicious intent."
