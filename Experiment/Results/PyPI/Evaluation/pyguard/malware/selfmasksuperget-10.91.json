      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'Windo​wsCache.exe' from that URL. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and runs a payload without user consent or notification. Additionally, the package name 'selfmasksuperget' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and may be part of a typosquatting or malicious package. The code runs this payload automatically during the setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a potentially malicious executable from a remote source during package installation, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
