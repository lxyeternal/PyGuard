      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded Fernet key. This pattern of decrypting and immediately executing code during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The package name 'BeautifuklSoup' is a typo-squatted variant of the legitimate 'BeautifulSoup' package, which is a common tactic used in supply chain attacks to trick users into installing malicious packages. The use of obfuscated encrypted payloads executed at install time, combined with network-related imports (requests) and the targeting of Windows systems, aligns with known malware supply chain attack patterns. There is no legitimate reason for executing decrypted code during installation, especially without user notification or validation. Therefore, this code is malicious and likely intended to execute hidden payloads on the victim system during package installation."
