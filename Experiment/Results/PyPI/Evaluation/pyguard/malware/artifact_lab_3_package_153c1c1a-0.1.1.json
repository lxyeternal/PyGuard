      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that automatically execute the function 'notmalfunc' during package installation or development setup. This function collects all environment variables from the host system, encodes them as URL parameters, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/8f782c5b-990f-4d3d-94cc-fd128b873693) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes automated, silent exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data during package installation, which is a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks. The use of a hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URL for data exfiltration, combined with execution triggered automatically during install/develop commands, strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the environment data may contain sensitive credentials or system information. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
