      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL (https://pastebin.com/raw/3xcr2My4), retrieves its content, and immediately uses that content as a URL to send a POST request with a JSON payload containing 'new run @everyone', which suggests automated notification or signaling to an attacker-controlled endpoint. Then, it generates a random integer and writes the content fetched from another suspicious URL (https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode) into a newly created Python script file with a randomized name in the current directory. Immediately after, it spawns a subprocess to execute this downloaded script without any validation, user consent, or sandboxing. This sequence of downloading code from untrusted sources, writing it to disk, and executing it dynamically is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The code is embedded in a setuptools setup script, which means this malicious behavior could be triggered during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The author metadata ('hacker') and the suspicious URLs further reinforce the malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or error handling that would justify these actions. Therefore, this code is malicious."
