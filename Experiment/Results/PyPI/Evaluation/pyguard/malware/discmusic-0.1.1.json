      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (a Discord CDN link) and saves it to a user-specific local path under AppData\\Local as 'explorer.exe'. It then immediately executes this downloaded file without any user interaction, validation, or consent. This sequence of network retrieval of a potentially untrusted binary, writing it to a sensitive user directory, and executing it directly is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, often used for payload delivery, persistence, or system compromise. The use of a misleading filename 'explorer.exe' in a non-standard location further indicates an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate system process. There is no benign justification for this pattern in typical software, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators such as remote code download and execution, use of environment variables to target user directories, and lack of user notification or validation."
