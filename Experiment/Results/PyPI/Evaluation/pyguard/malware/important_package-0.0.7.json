      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects environment and system information including the fully qualified domain name (hostname), the user's home directory path, and the current working directory. It then serializes this data into JSON, encodes it using base64, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a remote URL. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being exfiltrated, combined with the automatic, silent transmission of potentially sensitive system information to an external server without any user interaction or consent, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. This pattern matches known malware techniques for host fingerprinting and data exfiltration. Although the code does not execute remote code or spawn processes, the unauthorized collection and exfiltration of environment data to a suspicious endpoint is a hallmark of information-stealing malware."
