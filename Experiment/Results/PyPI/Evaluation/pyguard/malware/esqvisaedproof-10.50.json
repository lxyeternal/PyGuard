      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the use of a non-standard domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) further indicate malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of arbitrary code during package installation. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful commands on the victim's system, consistent with malware behavior."
