      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a known stealth technique. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute obfuscated PowerShell commands in a hidden manner is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can be used to download, execute, or perform unauthorized actions on the victim system without user consent or awareness. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during install is a critical risk indicator of malware behavior."
