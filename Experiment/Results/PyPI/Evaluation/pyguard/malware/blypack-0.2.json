      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a post_install function that executes a shell command using os.system to download a file from a suspicious, attacker-controlled URL (https://kymslgsrz9xelqdvm7uxogrrnit9ha5z.oastify.com/test) during the package installation process. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where arbitrary code or payloads can be fetched and potentially executed on the victim's system without user consent or interaction. The immediate invocation of post_install() at the end of the setup script ensures that the download happens automatically upon installation, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of a non-standard, obfuscated domain and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user notification further confirm that this code is designed to perform unauthorized network activity and possibly deliver or stage malicious payloads."
