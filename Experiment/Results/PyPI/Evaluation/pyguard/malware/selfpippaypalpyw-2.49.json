      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip hints at a malicious source). This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware that execute code during package installation. The package name 'selfpippaypalpyw' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and unrelated to the described functionality, further supporting malicious intent. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors and avoid detection also aligns with malware behavior. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute potentially harmful commands during installation, making it malicious."
