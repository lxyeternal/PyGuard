      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary decrypted code during package installation on Windows systems. Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a base64-encoded payload, which is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The package name 'requeits' is suspiciously similar to 'requests', indicating possible typosquatting. The decrypted payload is not visible in the source, indicating obfuscation and hiding of malicious intent. There is no user interaction or consent before execution, and the code runs automatically during installation, which is a critical risk behavior. These factors strongly indicate that the code is malicious."
