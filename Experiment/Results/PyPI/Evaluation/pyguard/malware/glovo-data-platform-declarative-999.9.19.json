      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the stack trace, environment variable keys, system uname details, and the public IP address of the host. It then encodes a hardcoded, base64-obfuscated URL and sends this collected data as a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to that external URL without any user interaction or consent. The use of base64 encoding to hide the remote endpoint, automatic data exfiltration at runtime, and the absence of legitimate business logic or user notification are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to evade execution in known analysis environments by checking the hostname and script filename before proceeding. The program terminates immediately after sending the data, which is a common tactic to avoid detection and forensic analysis. These behaviors align with typical malware patterns of environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration, confirming that the code is malicious."
