      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation without user consent or interaction. The package name 'requiirments' is suspiciously similar to 'requirements' (a common typo-squatting tactic). The obfuscated class name and meaningless description and long description strings further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The use of the 'fernet' module to decrypt a payload and then execute it dynamically is a classic supply chain attack vector, allowing attackers to run arbitrary code during installation. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a standard setup.py script. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with a supply chain attack that executes hidden payloads on Windows systems during package installation."
