      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'new_install' that registers a function '_post_install' to be executed at exit during the package installation process. The '_post_install' function performs several suspicious actions without user consent or notification: it creates/appends a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with a specific string, collects the public IP address of the host by querying 'https://api.ipify.org', retrieves the hostname via 'os.uname()[1]', and obtains the current script's directory path. It then encodes this collected environment information (IP, hostname, path) into a base64 string and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL constructed as 'https://kotko.org?alibaba/SREWorkstesla-faas2=<base64_encoded_data>'. This behavior constitutes automated environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The code executes this data collection and exfiltration silently during installation without user interaction or legitimate purpose, indicating malicious intent."
