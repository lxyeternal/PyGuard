It then attempts to execute this script in a new Python interpreter process (using a 'pythonw.exe' variant to likely run without a console window) via os.system. This behavior is a classic example of remote code execution from an untrusted source during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The code performs no user interaction or validation, silently downloads and runs arbitrary code, and uses obfuscation by writing the payload to a temporary file and launching it in a hidden process. Such patterns are strongly associated with malicious intent, including payload delivery, evasion, and unauthorized code execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically writes a Python script to a temporary file that contains an exec call to execute code fetched from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/vrdpn/raw). It then attempts to execute this script using a Python interpreter variant (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe' to likely run without a console window) via a shell command. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code at runtime without user interaction or validation—is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted external source, which is a classic hallmark of malware, including remote code execution, payload delivery, or backdoor installation. The use of temporary files, obfuscated variable names, and silent execution (try/except pass) further supports the intent to evade detection and run unauthorized code. There is no legitimate user notification, consent, or validation, and the remote URL is not a known trusted source, increasing the risk of compromise."
