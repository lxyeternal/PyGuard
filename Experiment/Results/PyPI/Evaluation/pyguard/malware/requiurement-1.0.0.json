      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The package name 'requiurement' is suspiciously similar to 'requirement' (typosquatting), which is a common tactic in malicious PyPI packages. The use of obfuscated class names and encrypted payloads executed during installation strongly indicates an attempt to hide malicious code execution. The code also specifies setup_requires for 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook, further supporting the intent to execute network and cryptographic operations during install. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful code during package installation on Windows systems, which is a critical security risk."
