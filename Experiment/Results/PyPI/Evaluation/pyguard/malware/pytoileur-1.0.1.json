      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed during the package installation process (in the InstallCommand.run method). This payload performs multiple suspicious and malicious actions: it retrieves the current user's login name and constructs paths to the Windows Startup folder, then writes PowerShell scripts and batch files into these startup locations. These scripts appear to set up a hidden PowerShell shell and run commands that download files from a remote server (http://51.77.140.144:8086/dl/runtime) and execute them. The use of base64 encoding to hide the payload, execution of shell commands without user consent, writing to startup folders for persistence, downloading and running remote code, and the silent try/except suppression of errors are all strong indicators of malicious behavior. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation to establish persistence, download additional payloads, and potentially exfiltrate data or compromise the system."
