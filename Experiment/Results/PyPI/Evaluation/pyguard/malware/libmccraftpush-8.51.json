      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) embedded in the comment, which is not a known legitimate source. This pattern of obfuscated command execution during package setup or installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command, execution of PowerShell in hidden mode, and lack of any legitimate business logic or user consent strongly indicate malicious intent."
