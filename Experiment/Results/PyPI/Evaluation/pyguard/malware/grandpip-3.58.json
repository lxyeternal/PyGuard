      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of obfuscated (Base64-encoded) PowerShell commands executed silently is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code is a setup call for a package with suspicious naming ('grandpip', 'modlib') and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which may be an attempt to disguise malicious payload delivery via a Python package installation. The combination of obfuscated command execution during package setup/install and the use of hidden PowerShell processes strongly indicates malicious intent."
