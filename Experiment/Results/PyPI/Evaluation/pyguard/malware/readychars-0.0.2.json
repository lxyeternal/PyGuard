      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and immediately executed using exec and compile, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload imports modules for temporary file handling, system execution, and URL opening, then writes and executes code fetched from suspicious hardcoded URLs (http://193.42.33.24/inject/1zGPvS8IX5cz9sSH and http://193.42.33.24/clip). This behavior includes downloading and executing remote code without user consent, which is a classic hallmark of malware. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic code execution, network communication to attacker-controlled IP addresses, and execution of downloaded payloads strongly indicate this code is malicious."
