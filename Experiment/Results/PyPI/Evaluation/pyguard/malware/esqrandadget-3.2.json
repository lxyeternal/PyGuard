      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only if it does not exist, it executes the PowerShell command. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further malicious payloads or performs unauthorized actions. This pattern of obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a hidden window is a well-known hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or payload delivery. Additionally, the package name 'esqrandadget' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' and a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) further indicate malicious intent. The use of try/except to suppress errors and the execution of code during setup (package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and consistent with malicious software."
