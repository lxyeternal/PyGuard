      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a stealthy check to avoid repeated execution. The PowerShell command is run with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and uses an encoded command, which is a common obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the payload. This pattern—executing obfuscated PowerShell commands silently during package setup—is a well-known hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading and executing further malicious payloads. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious author email and package name 'esqtoolstr' linked to a suspicious domain in the comment further supports malicious intent. The try/except blocks suppress any errors, which is typical in malware to avoid raising suspicion. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during installation without user consent or interaction, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity."
