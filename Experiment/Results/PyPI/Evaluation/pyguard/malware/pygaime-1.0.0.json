      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Within this method, it checks if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded string, which is decrypted at runtime and executed without any user interaction or validation. This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The obfuscated class name and the use of exec on decrypted data strongly indicate malicious intent. The code executes arbitrary code during installation, which can lead to unauthorized actions, including downloading further payloads, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
