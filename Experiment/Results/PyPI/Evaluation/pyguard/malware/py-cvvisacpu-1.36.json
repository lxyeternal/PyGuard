      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known method for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. Additionally, the author and email fields in the setup call reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which are suspicious and may be linked to malicious actors. The rest of the code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution during the setup phase strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation without user consent or notification."
