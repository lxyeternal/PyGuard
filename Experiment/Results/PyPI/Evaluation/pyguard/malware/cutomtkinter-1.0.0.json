      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscated encrypted data and dynamic execution without user consent or validation strongly indicates that the package is designed to execute hidden malicious code during installation. Additionally, the package name 'cutomtkinter' appears to be a typo-squatted name mimicking a legitimate package, which is a common tactic in malicious packages. The presence of network-related imports (requests) and cryptographic decryption (fernet) in the install hook further supports the conclusion that this code is intended to execute unauthorized, potentially harmful code on the user's system during package installation."
