      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that executes automatically during package installation. It collects the host's hostname and IP address using socket calls, then asynchronously sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes automated data exfiltration of system information during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for silent transmission of environment data during install time, without any legitimate business logic or user notification, strongly indicates malicious intent."
