      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized or harmful actions, such as downloading or executing additional payloads, persistence, or system compromise. This behavior is triggered automatically during the setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector in Python packages. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
