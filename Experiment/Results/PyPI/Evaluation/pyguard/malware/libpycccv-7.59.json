      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an attempt to avoid repeated execution or detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip and the encoded command referencing a suspicious domain 'cdn.discordapp.com' with a path that looks like a payload). This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware that execute code during package installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell command during import or setup is malicious. Therefore, this code is malicious."
