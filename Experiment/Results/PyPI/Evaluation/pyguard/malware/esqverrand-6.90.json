      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized or harmful actions, as suggested by the suspicious domain 'www.esquelesquad.rip' in the comment and the obfuscation of the command. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic hallmark of malware, often used in supply chain attacks to execute malicious payloads during package installation without user consent or notification. The presence of try/except blocks suppressing errors further suggests an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is executing hidden, obfuscated commands during package setup, which is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malicious intent."
