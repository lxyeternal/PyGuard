      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This obfuscation technique (base64-encoded PowerShell command) is a well-known method to hide the true intent of the command and evade detection. The command is executed silently (hidden window) without user interaction or notification. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a setup script with a suspicious package name and author email further support the likelihood of malicious intent. The subprocess call does not perform any legitimate build or installation task but instead executes potentially harmful code. These factors combined align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated code execution, stealthy process spawning, and potential remote code execution or payload delivery during package installation."
