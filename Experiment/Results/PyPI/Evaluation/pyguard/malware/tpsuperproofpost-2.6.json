      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest command to download and run an executable named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a remote location without user consent or notification. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to download and execute a payload silently. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious package name ('tpsuperproofpost') and author email ('tahgoficial@proton.me') combined with the obfuscated PowerShell command and the use of subprocess to execute it during the setup phase strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malicious package installation. The code also suppresses errors silently with try/except pass blocks, which is a common evasion technique. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated, and unauthorized remote code during package installation, which is a hallmark of malicious activity."
