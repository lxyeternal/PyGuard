      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a CustomInstallCommand class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute a large base64-decoded payload during package installation. This payload performs multiple suspicious and malicious actions: it retrieves the current user's login name and uses it to construct paths to sensitive Windows directories such as AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup and others. It writes multiple PowerShell scripts and batch files into these startup and system directories, which are designed to run hidden PowerShell commands that download and execute additional payloads from suspicious external URLs (e.g., https://api-hw.com/dl/w and similar). The scripts include commands to transfer files, run executables, and start background processes without user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload, execution of shell commands during installation, writing to startup folders for persistence, downloading and executing remote code, and the absence of any legitimate user interaction or business logic are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for supply chain attacks, remote code execution, data exfiltration, and persistence mechanisms commonly observed in malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
