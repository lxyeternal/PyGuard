      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a known obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window, which is a strong indicator of stealthy malicious behavior. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further raises suspicion. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is triggered during import or execution of this script, which is a common supply chain attack vector. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window, conditional execution based on directory existence, and lack of legitimate user interaction or business logic strongly indicate malicious intent."
