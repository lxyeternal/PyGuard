      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' in the user's Windows cache directory. This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a hidden window is a well-known technique used by malware for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, or persistence. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of this behavior inside a setup script further suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation. The author and email fields referencing 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me' combined with the suspicious behavior reinforce the malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
