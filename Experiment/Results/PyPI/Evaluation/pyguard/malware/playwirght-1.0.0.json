      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Within this method, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent or interaction. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during installation are typical characteristics of supply chain attacks and malware. Additionally, the package name 'playwirght' is a likely typo-squatting of the legitimate 'playwright' package, which is a common tactic used by attackers to trick users into installing malicious packages. The presence of network-related imports (requests) inside the install hook further suggests potential for network communication or data exfiltration, although the exact decrypted payload is not visible here. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious intent, including code obfuscation, encrypted payload execution during installation, and suspicious package naming."
