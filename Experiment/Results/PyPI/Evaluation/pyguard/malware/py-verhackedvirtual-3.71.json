      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only if it does not exist, it executes the PowerShell command, indicating a stealthy, conditional payload execution. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, the hidden execution, and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user consent strongly indicate malicious intent. Additionally, the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the suspicious package metadata (author 'EsqueleSquad', suspicious package name 'py-verhackedvirtual') further support the conclusion that this is a supply chain attack or malware embedded in a Python package setup script. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call wrapped in a try/except, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly normal package installation script. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving obfuscated code execution during package installation, stealth execution of encoded PowerShell commands, and potential further payload delivery or system compromise."
