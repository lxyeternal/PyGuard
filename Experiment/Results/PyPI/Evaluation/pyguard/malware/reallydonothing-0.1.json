      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. Specifically, it hooks into the setuptools installation process via a custom InstallCommand class that runs automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. During installation, it scans a system directory (/Library/Application Support) for paths matching a pattern and computes a hash-based check against a hardcoded byte sequence (VAR3). If a match is found, it triggers the CustomRun function. CustomRun dynamically reconstructs obfuscated URLs by XORing hardcoded byte arrays (VAR1, VAR2) with generated keys derived from the path and fixed strings. It then downloads a binary payload from one of these URLs depending on the CPU architecture. The downloaded content is XOR-decrypted with a generated key and saved as an executable file in the user's ~/.local/bin directory under the name 'donothing'. The binary is then made executable and launched silently via subprocess.Popen with output suppressed. This sequence of obfuscated URL construction, remote payload download, decryption, writing to disk, permission modification, and silent execution is a classic pattern of malware delivery and execution. The use of installation hooks to trigger this behavior ensures execution on victim machines during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The code contains no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic to justify these actions. The obfuscation and dynamic URL generation further indicate intent to evade detection. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious Python code, including remote code execution, payload delivery, obfuscation, and abuse of package installation hooks."
