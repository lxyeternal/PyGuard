      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class InstallCommand that overrides the setuptools install command to run custom code during package installation. Inside the run() method, it defines a large obfuscated string (wopvEaTEcopFEavc) and a numeric key string (iOpvEoeaaeavocp). It then performs a character-wise XOR decryption of the obfuscated string using the numeric key, reconstructing a Python code string. This decrypted code is then executed dynamically using eval(compile(...)). This pattern of obfuscation combined with dynamic code execution during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it allows execution of hidden arbitrary code on the user's system without consent or transparency. The obfuscation and immediate execution of decrypted code in the install hook is a classic supply chain attack technique to run malware payloads during package installation. There is no legitimate reason for such obfuscation and dynamic execution in a standard setup.py script. The try-except block suppresses any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Therefore, this code is malicious."
