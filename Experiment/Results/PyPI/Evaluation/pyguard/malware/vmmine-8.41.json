      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string. The command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script executed with the -EncodedCommand flag and the window style set to hidden, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then launches this hidden PowerShell process, indicating an attempt to execute code conditionally and stealthily. This behavior is highly indicative of malicious intent, as it involves obfuscated command execution without user interaction or notification, running in the background during package setup. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during installation strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism embedded in the package installation process."
