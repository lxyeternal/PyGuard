      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The use of subprocess to spawn PowerShell with an encoded command, combined with the hidden window style and obfuscation, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. Additionally, this execution occurs at import or setup time, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscation and no legitimate context confirms malicious intent."
