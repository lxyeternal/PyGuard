      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command, causing it to execute automatically during package installation. It collects sensitive system information such as OS details (via 'uname -a' or 'systeminfo'), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via 'curl ifconfig.me'), current user ('whoami'), and hostname. It then sends all this collected information in a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL, which is an external, attacker-controlled endpoint. This behavior constitutes silent data exfiltration of sensitive environment and user information without user consent or notification. The use of shell commands to gather system info combined with immediate network transmission during package installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and exfiltration. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
