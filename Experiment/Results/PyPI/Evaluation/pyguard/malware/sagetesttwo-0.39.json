      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that executes automatically during package installation. It performs the following suspicious actions: it retrieves the current user's login name to construct a path inside the Windows Startup folder, creates a new directory there if it does not exist, then clones a GitHub repository (https://github.com/dcsage/test2lmaos.git) into that directory. After cloning, it moves a script file (test.py) from the cloned repository into the Startup folder, effectively placing a script that will run automatically on user login. This behavior is characteristic of persistence mechanisms used by malware to maintain execution on system startup without user consent. The code executes these actions silently during installation without user interaction or notification, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of setuptools install hook to run arbitrary code that downloads and places files in the Startup folder is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent involved, and the code fetches and stages potentially untrusted code from an external source for automatic execution. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with malware persistence and remote code execution."
