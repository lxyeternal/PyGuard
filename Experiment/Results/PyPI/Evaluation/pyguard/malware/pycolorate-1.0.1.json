      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and compression (base64, zlib) combined with dynamic code execution via eval and exec. It constructs and executes code from decoded and decompressed data at runtime, which is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The obfuscation and dynamic execution prevent straightforward analysis and are commonly used to hide malicious payloads. The code imports modules and defines lambda functions that decode and execute hidden payloads without any user interaction or notification. Such patterns are strongly associated with malware, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential data exfiltration. The presence of obfuscated strings, dynamic eval/exec calls on decoded data, and lack of legitimate application logic confirm that this code is malicious."
