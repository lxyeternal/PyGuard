      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden, which is a common stealth technique. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command, combined with silent execution (hidden window), is a classic malware technique to evade detection and execute potentially harmful payloads. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent, a known vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the setup call appears normal but is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, which can be used to hide failures or suspicious activity. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
