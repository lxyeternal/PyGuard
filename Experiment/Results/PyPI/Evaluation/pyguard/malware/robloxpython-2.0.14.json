      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed immediately via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL (https://pastebin.com/raw/hEF5HaFc), reads the response, and writes it to a file named 'pkg_installer.exe'. It then executes this file via a shell command and attempts to remove it afterward. This sequence of downloading an executable from an untrusted external source, saving it locally, executing it, and deleting it is a classic pattern of malware delivery and execution. Additionally, the code runs automatically during the package setup process without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the payload and the execution of arbitrary code during installation further confirm the malicious nature of this code."
