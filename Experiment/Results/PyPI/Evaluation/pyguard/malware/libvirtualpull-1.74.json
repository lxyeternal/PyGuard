      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it runs obfuscated PowerShell code silently without user interaction or notification. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and analysis. The script is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling code execution during package installation without user consent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
