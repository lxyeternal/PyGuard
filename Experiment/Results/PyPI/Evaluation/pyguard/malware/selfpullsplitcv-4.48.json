      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and runs a PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest command to download and execute a file named 'Esquele.exe' in the Windows cache directory. This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic hallmark of malware, often used in supply chain attacks to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without user consent or notification. The presence of a suspicious author email and package name further supports malicious intent. The try-except blocks suppress errors, which is typical for malware to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a potentially malicious payload during package installation."
