      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded string and decrypted with a hardcoded Fernet key. This decrypted code is executed immediately during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. Such behavior is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages that execute arbitrary, potentially harmful code during installation. The obfuscation via encryption and immediate execution of decrypted code, combined with the use of network-related modules (requests) inside the install hook, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the package name 'Matplotlub' is a typo-squatting variant of the legitimate 'matplotlib' package, which is a common tactic used by attackers to trick users into installing malicious packages. All these factors confirm that the code contains malicious behavior."
