      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded Fernet key. This pattern of decrypting and immediately executing code during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscated class names, suspicious package name ('requirementsttx'), and the execution of hidden payloads during install time are hallmark signs of a supply chain attack or malware. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks but instead runs concealed code, which could perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, persistence, or further payload download. Therefore, this code is malicious."
