      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the suspicious URL comment (# www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated command string. This execution happens automatically during the setup process without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The presence of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and the use of PowerShell for potentially downloading or executing further code strongly indicates malicious intent."
