      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string. The command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell code, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide malicious intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW, indicating stealth execution without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. This behavior occurs automatically during the setup script execution, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during package installation strongly indicates malicious intent, such as downloading or executing further payloads, privilege escalation, or persistence mechanisms. The rest of the setup code appears benign, but the presence of this hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution embedded in the installation process is a critical risk indicator of malware."
