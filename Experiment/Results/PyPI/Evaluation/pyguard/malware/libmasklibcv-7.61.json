      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a typical evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands strongly suggest that the code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful payloads during package setup or installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is used here as a cover to execute the malicious payload during installation. This pattern is a known supply chain attack vector in Python ecosystems. Therefore, this code is malicious."
