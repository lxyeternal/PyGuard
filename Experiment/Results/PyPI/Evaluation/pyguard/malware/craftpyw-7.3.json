      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The use of obfuscated (Base64-encoded) PowerShell commands executed silently during package setup or installation is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading and executing further payloads. The rest of the code appears to be a setup script for a package, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution is a clear malicious payload embedded in the installation process, consistent with supply chain attacks and stealthy malware delivery."
