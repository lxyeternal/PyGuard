      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a base64-encoded, encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The obfuscated class name and the use of encrypted code executed during package installation strongly suggest a supply chain attack vector. The package name 'Matploltlib' is a typo-squatted variant of the legitimate 'matplotlib' package, which is a common tactic used by attackers to trick users into installing malicious packages. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks but instead executes hidden code, which could perform arbitrary malicious actions such as downloading further payloads, exfiltrating data, or compromising the system. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
