      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to execute hidden, potentially malicious PowerShell commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a known method to evade detection and hide the true intent of the command. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. The subprocess call runs automatically during import without user consent, in a hidden window, and executes obfuscated code, all of which are strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware delivery during package installation."
