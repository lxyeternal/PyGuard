      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated in base64 UTF-16LE format, which is a common method to hide the true intent of the command. The command references a suspicious URL (github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe), indicating it attempts to download and execute a remote payload without user interaction or consent. The presence of this behavior in a setup script (during package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution on the victim's machine during installation. The package name and author information appear suspicious and do not correspond to known legitimate software. The code suppresses errors silently with try/except pass blocks, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent."
