      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external URL (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and user information without user consent or legitimate purpose. The use of a suspicious external domain for data exfiltration during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. There is no benign justification for this pattern in setup scripts, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators such as environment discovery, data exfiltration, and execution of network communication during install time. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
