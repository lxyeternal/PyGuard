      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This means arbitrary code is executed at install time without user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code during package installation is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The package name 'playwritgh' appears suspicious and possibly a typo-squatting attempt. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook. The decrypted payload is not visible but is executed directly, indicating remote code execution capability. This behavior is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hijacks the installation process to run hidden code, potentially leading to system compromise or data exfiltration."
