      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and outputs it to a file named '~\\/WindowsCache.exe', then executes it. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and executes a payload silently without user consent. The presence of this code in a setup script further indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and downloading/executing a remote executable without user interaction are all hallmark signs of malicious intent."
