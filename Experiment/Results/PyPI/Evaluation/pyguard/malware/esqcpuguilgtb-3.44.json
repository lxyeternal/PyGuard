      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or staging technique. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a command that invokes 'Invoke-WebRequest' to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's temp directory, which is a typical behavior of malware for downloading and running additional payloads. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag further indicates stealth execution. Additionally, the setup() call with a suspicious package name and author email address linked to 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me' is likely a disguise to appear as a legitimate package while executing malicious code during installation. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including obfuscated command execution, stealthy background process spawning, remote payload download and execution, and abuse of package installation hooks for code execution."
