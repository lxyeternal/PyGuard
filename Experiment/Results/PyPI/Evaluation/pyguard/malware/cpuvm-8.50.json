      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window, which is a common technique for stealthy execution of malicious payloads. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists and only then runs the PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The use of obfuscated (Base64-encoded) PowerShell commands executed silently during package setup is a hallmark of malware, often used for persistence, payload delivery, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears legitimate but is used here as a cover to execute the malicious PowerShell command during installation or setup. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and remote code execution, making the code malicious."
