      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The directory 'tahg' is checked for existence, and if it does not exist, the PowerShell command is executed, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution or detection. The use of an obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell command executed silently is a hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading and executing further payloads. Additionally, the package name 'esqgrandnvidialib' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and unrelated to the described functionality, suggesting a typosquatted or malicious package. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask errors and avoid detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, and suspicious package metadata strongly indicates malicious intent."
