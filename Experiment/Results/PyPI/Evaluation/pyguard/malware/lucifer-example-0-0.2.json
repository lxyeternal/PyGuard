      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically creates a temporary Python script file containing code that downloads and executes Python code from a remote URL (https://rentry.co/ki74h/raw) without any validation or user consent. It then attempts to execute this script using the Python interpreter in a new process. This pattern of fetching and executing remote code at runtime is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted external source. The use of a temporary file to hold the downloaded code and the silent execution without user interaction or notification further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The hardcoded external URL is suspicious and not associated with any known legitimate service. Overall, this code enables remote code execution and potential payload delivery, which is strongly indicative of malicious intent."
