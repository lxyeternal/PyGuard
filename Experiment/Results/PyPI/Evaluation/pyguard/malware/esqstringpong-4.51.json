      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or performing system compromise. Additionally, the package metadata references a suspicious author and domain (EsqueleSquad, tahgoficial@proton.me, www.esquelesquad.rip), which is uncommon for benign packages. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
