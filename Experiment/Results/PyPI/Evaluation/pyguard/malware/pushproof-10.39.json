      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the command from casual inspection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during the import or setup phase is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware embedded in Python packages. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators, including obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup, all of which are strongly associated with malicious behavior."
