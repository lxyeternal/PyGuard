      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (Base64 encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) which is not a known legitimate domain. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden execution of encoded PowerShell commands during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands that likely perform unauthorized actions, making it malicious."
