      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for evasion and to execute arbitrary code without user awareness. The base64-encoded command likely contains a PowerShell script that performs unauthorized or harmful actions, although the exact decoded content is not shown here. Additionally, this execution occurs at import time (during setup or installation), without any user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious package behavior. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution alongside it strongly indicates malicious intent. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy code execution and potential payload delivery."
