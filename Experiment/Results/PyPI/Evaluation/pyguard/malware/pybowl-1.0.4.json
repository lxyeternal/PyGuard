      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a CustomInstallCommand class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute a large base64-encoded payload during package installation. This payload, when decoded and executed, performs multiple suspicious and malicious actions: it accesses the current user's login name and constructs paths to the Windows Startup folder, then writes multiple PowerShell scripts and batch files into that folder. These scripts appear to be designed to run automatically on system startup. The payload also executes PowerShell commands in hidden windows, downloads files from suspicious external URLs (e.g., 'https://api-hw.com/dl/w', 'https://api-hw.com/dl/ru'), and runs them. It uses subprocesses to run these scripts and binaries, indicating multi-stage payload execution. The code uses obfuscation via base64 encoding to hide the malicious payload, executes code during package installation without user consent, and targets Windows-specific user directories for persistence. These behaviors are classic indicators of supply chain attacks, remote code execution, persistence mechanisms, and data exfiltration attempts. Therefore, this code is malicious."
