      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell invocation that runs a web request to 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0' and outputs it to a file named '~\\WindowsCache.exe', then invokes that executable. This behavior is consistent with downloading and executing a remote payload without user consent or notification, a hallmark of malicious activity. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious code during package installation. The try-except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, remote payload download and execution, and execution during package installation."
