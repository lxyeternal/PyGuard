      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware and supply chain attacks. Key malicious characteristics include: 1) The code writes base64-decoded Python scripts into a hidden temporary directory under the user's APPDATA local temp path, specifically '__pycache__', without user consent or notification. 2) It then executes these scripts in hidden subprocesses using 'pythonw.exe' with flags to suppress windows, indicating stealth execution. 3) The decoded scripts contain obfuscated code that collects sensitive user information such as browser cookies (via 'browser_cookie3'), user login data, environment variables, and system details. 4) The code performs automated network communication, sending collected data via HTTP POST requests to suspicious or attacker-controlled endpoints, including hardcoded IP addresses and webhook URLs. 5) It uses threading to run background tasks for data exfiltration and environment reconnaissance, a common evasion technique. 6) The installation hook triggers this behavior automatically during package installation ('setup' script), which is a known supply chain attack vector. 7) The code includes multiple layers of obfuscation, including base64 encoding of payloads, dynamic code execution, and use of cryptographic decryption routines. 8) It accesses and exfiltrates sensitive files and directories such as user documents, downloads, desktop, roaming profiles, and browser data without user interaction. 9) The presence of suspicious filenames like 'bypass.py', 'main.cpython-39.py', and 'scripts.cpython-39.py' in temporary hidden folders further supports malicious intent. 10) The code suppresses errors and logs to obscure its activity, and attempts to create marker files like 'DEBUG' to possibly control execution flow. 11) The overall behavior matches known malware patterns including environment discovery, credential theft, data exfiltration, stealth execution, and remote code execution during package installation. Based on these observations and the extensive knowledge points provided, this code is conclusively malicious."
