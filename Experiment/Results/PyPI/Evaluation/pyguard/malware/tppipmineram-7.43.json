      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and attempts to invoke a web request to download or execute a payload from a Dropbox URL. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden window execution, and encoded commands is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy payload delivery, remote code execution, or persistence. Additionally, the package name 'tppipmineram' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and potentially typosquatted or attacker-controlled. The code runs this malicious payload automatically during the setup process without user interaction or consent, which is typical of supply chain attacks. The try/except blocks suppress errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is malicious and designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands that likely download and run further malware."
