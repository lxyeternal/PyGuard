      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, logged-in username, contents of /etc/passwd (on Linux/macOS), OS information, current directory, and directory listing using shell commands executed via os.popen. It then encodes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://rk8xxqzdug.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Test/response) without any user interaction or consent. This data exfiltration occurs automatically during the execution of the setup script, which is part of the package installation process. Such behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware, as it silently collects and transmits sensitive environment and user information to an attacker-controlled server. The absence of any legitimate business logic or user notification, combined with the immediate network transmission of sensitive data during package setup, strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information without any user interaction or consent, including hostname, logged-in username, contents of /etc/passwd (a sensitive file containing user account information), OS details, current directory, and directory listings. This data collection is done silently and automatically based on the detected OS. The retrieval of the /etc/passwd file on Linux/macOS is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as this file contains sensitive user account information that is typically not accessed by benign applications. The code uses shell commands executed via os.popen to gather this information, which is a common technique in malware for environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration preparation. Although the code snippet does not show explicit data exfiltration (e.g., network transmission), the pattern of collecting sensitive environment and credential-related data without user consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in the context of supply chain attacks or information stealers. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or error handling beyond a generic catch block further supports the conclusion that this code is designed for unauthorized data collection, which is a critical risk indicator of malware."
