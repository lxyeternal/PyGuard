      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the obfuscated base64 string and the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip). This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to execute hidden payloads during package installation or execution without user consent. The presence of this obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution combined with the lack of any legitimate user interaction or notification strongly indicates malicious intent."
