      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (cdnd.discordapp.com/attachments/...), which is a known vector for malware delivery. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command, combined with execution during package setup, is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The package metadata references 'EsqueleSquad' and an email address, which may be attacker-controlled. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands that likely download and run malicious payloads, constituting a high-risk malicious behavior."
