      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches PowerShell with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a well-known obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command in hidden window mode is a strong indicator of stealthy, unauthorized code execution. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to execute hidden payloads or download and run further malicious code without user consent or notification. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during the setup phase strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malicious package installation script. Therefore, this code exhibits critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
