      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username without any user consent or notification. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (an ngrok.io domain, which is commonly used for temporary tunnels and often abused by attackers). This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The code executes automatically during installation, without user interaction or legitimate business logic, and contacts an attacker-controlled server to leak system information. Such behavior is strongly associated with malicious intent and is not typical of benign packages."
