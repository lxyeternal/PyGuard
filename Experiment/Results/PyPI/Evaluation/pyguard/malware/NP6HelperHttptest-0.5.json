      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (ActionOnInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it automatically downloads two executable files (a .exe and a .dll) from a suspicious, non-standard domain (https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz), writes them to a temporary directory with a prefix 'DriverGenius', and then immediately executes the downloaded .exe file with a specific argument ('showdeskband') in a new process session. This behavior occurs silently during package installation without any user interaction or consent. The combination of downloading executables from an untrusted external source, writing them to a temporary directory, and executing them during installation is a classic hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The domain used is not a known trusted source, and the code does not perform any validation or integrity checks on the downloaded files. This pattern is strongly associated with malware that delivers and executes payloads during package installation, enabling attackers to compromise systems through trusted package workflows."
