      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string passed via the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated in base64 Unicode format, which is a common technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated detection. The PowerShell process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during the import phase or setup phase is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code executes during package installation or import without user consent. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package setup, all of which are hallmark signs of malware."
