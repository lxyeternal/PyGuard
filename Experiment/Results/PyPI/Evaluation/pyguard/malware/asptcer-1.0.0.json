      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command. During installation, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://9.30.214.68:9090) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of automated data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded external IP for sending system information, combined with execution during the install phase, strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at reconnaissance or credential theft. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the pattern matches known malware behaviors involving environment data collection and exfiltration during package installation."
