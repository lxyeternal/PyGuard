      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and may be linked to malicious actors. The setup call appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except that suppresses errors, which is a common evasion technique. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script, executed silently and without user interaction, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware installation routines."
