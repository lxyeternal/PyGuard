      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name ('tpguiosintre') further raise suspicion. The subprocess call uses an encoded PowerShell command, which is a well-known hallmark of malicious behavior, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try/except block, likely to mask the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth execution, and potential supply chain attack vector during package installation."
