      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' in a hidden manner. This pattern of obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell execution, especially during package setup/install time, is a classic hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution suggests evasion or persistence attempts. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup but silently triggers this hidden payload execution. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, stealthy background process spawning, and use of suspicious external URLs, confirming the code is malicious."
