      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests stealth or persistence behavior. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, possibly downloading or executing further payloads or performing system modifications. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command and the execution during the setup script (package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector. The author and email fields referencing 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me' along with the commented URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' further suggest malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during package installation, which is a hallmark of malware."
