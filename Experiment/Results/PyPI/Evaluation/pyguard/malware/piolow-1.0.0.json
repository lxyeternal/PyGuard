      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'GruppeInstall' that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The use of obfuscated encrypted data and dynamic execution during installation strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code runs silently in the background. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, execution of decrypted code, and execution during package installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
