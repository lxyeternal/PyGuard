      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware technique. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be a persistence or evasion mechanism. The presence of a suspicious comment with a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the malicious payload is triggered automatically during import or execution without user interaction or consent. This pattern—obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup—is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware."
