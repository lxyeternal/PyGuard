      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and other sensitive user data. It collects Discord tokens from various local storage paths of browsers and Discord clients, decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI, and extracts user information such as email, phone, badges, billing info, and friends list via Discord API calls using stolen tokens. The code then exfiltrates this sensitive data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without user consent. It also searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files with keywords related to accounts, passwords, wallets, and tokens, uploads them to anonfiles.com, and sends links to the attacker. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, multi-threading for stealth, and subprocess calls to kill processes to access locked files. It performs no legitimate user interaction or notification and operates silently in the background. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook, automated collection and exfiltration of credentials and personal data, decryption of encrypted browser data, and uploading of user files to external servers are definitive indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
