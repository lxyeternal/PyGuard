      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class GruppeInstall that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated encrypted data and immediate execution during package installation strongly indicates that the package is designed to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the victim's system during installation. The package name and metadata appear random and meaningless, which is typical of malicious or typosquatted packages. There is no legitimate reason for executing decrypted code during install, especially without user notification or validation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
