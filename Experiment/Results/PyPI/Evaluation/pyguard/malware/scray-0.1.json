      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It performs conditional checks on command-line arguments and platform, then enters loops with large numeric conditions that control execution flow. The code imports modules like pip and win32com, attempts to create and write files in user directories (e.g., using environment variables like APPDATA), and uses Windows COM interfaces to create and save shortcuts. It also walks through directories, searches for files with specific extensions, and manipulates them. The obfuscation and dynamic construction of strings, combined with file system modifications in user/system directories, and the use of Windows-specific automation interfaces strongly indicate malicious intent. Such behavior is typical of malware that attempts persistence, payload deployment, or system compromise during package installation or execution. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign setup tasks but instead executes complex, hidden operations that align with known malicious patterns such as stealthy file creation, environment reconnaissance, and potential payload execution."
