      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window, which is typical for stealthy malicious payload execution. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The presence of a suspicious author name 'EsqueleSquad', a suspicious package name 'tplibtoolhacked', and a suspicious author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further supports the malicious nature. The use of distutils setup with try/except blocks suppresses errors, which is often used to hide malicious activity during package installation. Overall, this code is consistent with a supply chain attack or malware that executes obfuscated PowerShell commands silently during package installation."
