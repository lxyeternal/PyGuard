      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to execute hidden, potentially malicious PowerShell commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a known method to evade detection and hide the true intent of the command. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is triggered during import or installation due to the subprocess call outside of any function or user-triggered event. This pattern of executing obfuscated PowerShell commands in a hidden window during package setup or import is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware delivery mechanisms."
