      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing and supply chain attack malware. Key malicious characteristics include: 1) The setup script writes base64-encoded Python scripts to a hidden temporary directory and executes them in the background without user interaction or consent. 2) The decoded scripts perform environment reconnaissance by collecting user profile paths, browser cookies (via browser_cookie3), and other sensitive files such as roaming profiles, documents, downloads, and desktop data. 3) The code uses subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags and obfuscated PowerShell commands, indicating stealthy execution. 4) It performs automated network communication, sending collected data via HTTP POST requests to suspicious or hardcoded endpoints, including non-official domains and IP addresses. 5) The code dynamically decodes and executes obfuscated payloads, including zlib decompression and base64 decoding, followed by immediate execution, a classic malware obfuscation and payload delivery technique. 6) It collects and exfiltrates browser cookies, user login information, and potentially passwords, without any user notification or legitimate purpose. 7) The installation hook triggers this behavior automatically during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. 8) The presence of multiple layers of obfuscation, environment variable usage to locate sensitive directories, and spawning of multiple background threads to execute payloads further confirm malicious intent. 9) The code attempts to create and delete files in user directories and temporary folders, consistent with staging and cleanup behavior of malware. 10) The use of suspicious repository URLs, script names (e.g., 'bypass.py'), and hardcoded webhook URLs also support the conclusion of malicious activity. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily collect sensitive user data, including browser cookies and credentials, and exfiltrate it to attacker-controlled servers during package installation, constituting a severe security threat."
