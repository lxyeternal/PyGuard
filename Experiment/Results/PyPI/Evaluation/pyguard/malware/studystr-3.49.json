      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware to evade detection. The base64-encoded command likely contains a malicious payload or instructions, as it is not decoded or inspected in the code, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation and malicious intent. Additionally, this execution happens automatically during the import or setup phase without any user interaction or notification, which is suspicious. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution alongside it strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during package installation or import. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
