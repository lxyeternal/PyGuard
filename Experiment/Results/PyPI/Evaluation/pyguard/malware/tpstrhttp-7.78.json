      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command, the check for a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution), and the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) strongly suggest stealthy, unauthorized execution of potentially harmful code. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks or post-installation payload execution. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution during import or setup is malicious. Therefore, this code is malicious."
