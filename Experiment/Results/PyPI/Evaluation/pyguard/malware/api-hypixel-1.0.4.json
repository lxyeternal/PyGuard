      "malicious_behavior": "The code reads potentially sensitive user configuration files related to gaming and Minecraft accounts from the user's home directory without any user interaction or consent. It then decodes a base64-encoded URL to retrieve a JSON object containing a webhook URL, which is attacker-controlled. The code proceeds to send the contents of these configuration files via an HTTP POST request to this webhook URL. This behavior constitutes automated, silent exfiltration of user data to a remote server, a hallmark of credential-stealing or information-exfiltration malware. The use of base64 encoding to hide the remote URL, the targeting of user-specific configuration files, and the immediate network transmission without any legitimate business logic or user notification strongly indicate malicious intent."
