      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information including OS details, network interfaces, running processes, logged-in users, and external IP address without user consent. It extracts browser stored passwords from Chrome and Edge by copying and reading their 'Login Data' SQLite databases, which is a clear credential theft technique. The code downloads multiple executable files from hardcoded external URLs (including .exe and .dll files) into temporary directories and executes them silently, which is a classic payload delivery and execution pattern. It uploads collected sensitive data files (system info, IP info, browser passwords) to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, enabling data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server. The 'install' function downloads and runs additional executables from remote sources, further indicating multi-stage malware behavior. The entire sequence runs automatically without user interaction or notification, including during package setup, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of temporary directories for storing malicious payloads, combined with execution via os.system and subprocess.run, and the presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled URLs and webhook endpoints, confirms the intent to steal credentials, gather system intelligence, and execute arbitrary code remotely. These behaviors align with known malware patterns such as information stealing, remote code execution, and data exfiltration, making this code malicious."
