      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized or harmful actions, as suggested by the suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscation technique used. This pattern—executing obfuscated PowerShell commands in hidden mode during package setup—is a well-known hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or payload delivery. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears legitimate but is used here as a cover to execute the malicious payload. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Therefore, this code is malicious."
