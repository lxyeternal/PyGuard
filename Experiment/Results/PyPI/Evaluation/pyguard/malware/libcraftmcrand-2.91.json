      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or staging technique. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a command that invokes a PowerShell web request with hidden window style, which is a strong indicator of downloading or executing a remote payload stealthily. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a non-standard package name, which may be used to disguise malicious code as a legitimate library. These factors combined—use of obfuscated PowerShell commands, hidden execution, remote URL referencing, and execution during package setup—are hallmark indicators of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack or malware payload delivery."
