      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The setup call appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except that suppresses errors, possibly to hide failures. The overall pattern—obfuscated command execution via PowerShell in a hidden window during package setup/install—is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. Therefore, this code is malicious."
