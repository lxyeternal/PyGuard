      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed during the setup script execution is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading and executing further payloads. The directory existence check for 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. The package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name 'tpcraftcraftencode' with an unusual author email. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with spawning a hidden PowerShell process is a well-known malicious pattern. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a setup script, and the code suppresses errors silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection."
