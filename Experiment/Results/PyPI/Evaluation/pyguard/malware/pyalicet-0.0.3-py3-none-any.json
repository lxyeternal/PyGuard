      "malicious_behavior": "The code makes HTTP GET requests to suspicious, hardcoded, and attacker-controlled external domains (oastify.com subdomain) without any user interaction or legitimate context. The first request to the /init endpoint likely signals initialization or beaconing to a command-and-control server. The code then sleeps for 60 seconds, which is a common evasion or timing technique to avoid immediate detection or sandbox analysis. After the delay, it makes a second GET request to /sleep on the same suspicious domain, which could be a keep-alive, status update, or trigger for further malicious activity. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or error handling. The use of hardcoded, non-standard URLs and automated network communication to unknown external servers is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with malware behavior such as remote control, data exfiltration, or staging further payloads."
