      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (Base64 encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed in hidden mode is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks to execute malicious code during package installation. The use of obfuscation (Base64 encoding) and execution of shell commands during setup without any legitimate reason or user consent strongly indicates malicious intent."
