      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The package name 'seleunium' is suspiciously similar to 'selenium', indicating possible typosquatting. The use of obfuscated encrypted data and immediate execution during installation strongly suggests a supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code attempts to run arbitrary code silently during installation, which is a critical risk indicator of malware."
