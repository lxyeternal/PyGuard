      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the command being executed. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The PowerShell command itself is obfuscated and likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking a web request to a suspicious URL (based on the encoded string content). This behavior is consistent with malware patterns that execute hidden payloads during package installation or setup scripts, leveraging the installation process to run arbitrary code. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscated commands strongly indicates malicious behavior."
