      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command class with an obfuscated name that overrides the install process. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a base64-encoded payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a hallmark of malicious behavior, often used in supply chain attacks to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation. The package name 'customtkimter' appears suspicious and possibly typosquatted. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and execution during installation strongly indicates this code is designed to deliver and execute a hidden malicious payload, consistent with known malware patterns. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
