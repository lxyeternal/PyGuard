      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during the setup process is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading and executing further payloads. Additionally, the author and email fields reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which may be associated with suspicious or malicious activity. The rest of the setup code appears benign, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
