      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a binary file named 'node' from a suspicious, non-standard URL (https://github-bebra.s3.filebase.com/node) and writes it to the /tmp directory without any user interaction or consent. It also writes a configuration file '/tmp/.gitler' with settings that appear to configure a cryptocurrency mining operation (e.g., 'mode': 'nicehash', 'pools' with an IP address and port). Then, it executes the downloaded binary with the configuration file by running a shell command that changes directory to /tmp, makes the binary executable, and runs it. This sequence of downloading an executable from an untrusted external source, writing configuration files for mining, and executing the binary silently during package setup is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically unauthorized cryptocurrency mining (cryptojacking). The code runs automatically on import or installation (via the main() call before setuptools.setup), which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded suspicious URL, writing to /tmp, and executing an unverified binary without validation or user consent confirms the code is malicious."
