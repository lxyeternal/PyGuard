      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The use of subprocess to spawn PowerShell with an encoded command, combined with the lack of legitimate context or user consent, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. These factors collectively indicate that the code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands likely for malicious purposes."
