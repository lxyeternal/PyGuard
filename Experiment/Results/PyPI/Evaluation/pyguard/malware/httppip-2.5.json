      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. This pattern of obfuscation (base64-encoded PowerShell command), stealth execution, and conditional execution based on file existence is a classic hallmark of malware or supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a package with suspicious naming ('httppip', 'tahgoficial@proton.me' author email) which may be used as a disguise or to facilitate installation. The presence of try/except blocks suppressing errors further suggests an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the code executes hidden, obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup/install, which is a known vector for malicious payload delivery and execution."
