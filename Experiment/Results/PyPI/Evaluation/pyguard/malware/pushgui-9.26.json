      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The use of subprocess.Popen to run PowerShell with an encoded command in a hidden window is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it is commonly used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell execution makes the entire code malicious."
