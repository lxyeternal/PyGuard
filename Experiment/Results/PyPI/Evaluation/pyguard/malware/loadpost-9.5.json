      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it runs obfuscated PowerShell code silently without user interaction or notification. The base64-encoded command is not decoded or inspected in the source, but the use of encoded PowerShell commands in hidden windows is a well-known malware technique for stealthy execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the subprocess is only launched if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a persistence or evasion mechanism. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during the import or setup phase is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with encoded commands, and the use of try/except to silently ignore errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Therefore, this code is malicious."
