      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window hidden and uses obfuscation to evade detection. Additionally, the setup() call is wrapped in a try/except block and includes suspicious metadata such as the author 'EsqueleSquad' and email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which may be associated with malicious packages. The presence of a comment with a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) further suggests malicious intent. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process creation, and conditional execution during package setup strongly indicates this code is designed for malicious purposes, likely as part of a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism."
