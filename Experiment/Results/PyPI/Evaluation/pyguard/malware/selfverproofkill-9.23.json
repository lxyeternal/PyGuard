      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command attempts to invoke a web request to a suspicious URL (\"https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0\") and output the result to a file named \"~/WindowsCache.exe\", then execute it. This behavior is consistent with downloading and executing a remote payload without user consent or notification, a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, enabling execution during package installation. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The package metadata references suspicious author and email, and the overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code execution, obfuscation, and remote payload delivery."
