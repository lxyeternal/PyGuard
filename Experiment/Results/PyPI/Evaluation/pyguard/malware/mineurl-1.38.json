      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a typical stealth technique. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup or installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as legitimate packages rarely execute hidden encoded PowerShell commands without user interaction or notification. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask errors and avoid raising suspicion. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and conditional execution strongly indicates malicious intent."
