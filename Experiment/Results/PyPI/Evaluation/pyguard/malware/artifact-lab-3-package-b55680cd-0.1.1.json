      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that automatically execute the function 'notmalfunc' during package installation or development setup. This function collects all environment variables from the host system, encodes them as URL parameters, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain 'http://8hqnqd3insnk7efz3iiokreih9n0brzg.oastify.com' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes automated, silent exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of a non-standard, attacker-controlled domain for data exfiltration, combined with execution triggered automatically during install/develop commands, strongly indicates malicious intent."
