      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for evasion and to execute arbitrary or malicious payloads without user awareness. The base64-encoded command is not decoded or inspected in the source, but the pattern of launching a hidden PowerShell with encoded commands is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means the malicious payload executes during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. The try-except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection or interruption. The rest of the setup call appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window, conditional execution based on directory existence, and embedding in a package setup script strongly indicates malicious behavior."
