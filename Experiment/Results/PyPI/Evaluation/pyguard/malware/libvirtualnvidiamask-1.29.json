      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a typical stealth technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a package setup with a suspicious name ('libvirtualnvidiamask') and author email further suggest malicious intent. The code executes this hidden PowerShell command automatically during the setup process without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. Given these factors, the code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
