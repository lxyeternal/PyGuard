      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates stealthy execution without user notification. This behavior is strongly associated with malicious activity, as it enables stealthy execution of potentially harmful PowerShell commands during package installation or setup. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
