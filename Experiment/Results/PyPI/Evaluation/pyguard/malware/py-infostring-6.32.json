      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or performing system modifications. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence mechanism. Additionally, the author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and the commented URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' hint at a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The code runs this malicious payload automatically during the setup process without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. These factors combined, especially the obfuscated PowerShell command execution in a hidden window during package installation, confirm that the code is malicious."
