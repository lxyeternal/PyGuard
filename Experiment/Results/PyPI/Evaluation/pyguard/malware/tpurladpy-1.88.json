      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking a web request to a suspicious URL (notably the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip) and writing output to a hidden executable file (~/WindowsCache.exe). This pattern of obfuscation, hidden execution, and encoded PowerShell commands is a well-known technique used by malware for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, or persistence. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. The package name and author information appear suspicious and do not correspond to known legitimate libraries. The try/except blocks suppress errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealthy process spawning, and potential remote code execution."
