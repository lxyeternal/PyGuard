      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during the setup process, combined with the suspicious domain comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name and author email, strongly suggests this is a supply chain attack or malware payload delivery. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, stealth execution, and execution during package installation, all of which are hallmark behaviors of malicious code."
