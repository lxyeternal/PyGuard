      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of an obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell command executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. The directory existence check for 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence behavior. This execution occurs during the package setup phase, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a typical setup call, but the presence of this hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution during installation strongly indicates malicious behavior."
