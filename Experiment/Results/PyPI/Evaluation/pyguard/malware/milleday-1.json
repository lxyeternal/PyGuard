      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a malicious wallet stealer targeting the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet. It collects sensitive wallet files and password files from the user's AppData roaming directory and common user folders (Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It then compresses these files into a ZIP archive named after the user. The script gathers the victim's username and public IP address, constructs a message including a wallet stealer tag and country flag, and exfiltrates the ZIP archive and message to an attacker-controlled Telegram bot via hardcoded bot token and chat ID. The behavior includes silent data collection without user consent, automated packaging of sensitive credential files, and network exfiltration to a hardcoded external endpoint. These actions match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including credential theft, data exfiltration, use of hardcoded attacker-controlled tokens and endpoints, and lack of user interaction or notification. Therefore, this code is malicious."
