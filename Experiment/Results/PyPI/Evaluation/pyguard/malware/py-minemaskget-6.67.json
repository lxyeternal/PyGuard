      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and analysis. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The presence of a suspicious URL in a comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further suggest malicious intent. The use of such obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup is a known supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution during installation. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealthy process spawning, and potential remote payload execution."
