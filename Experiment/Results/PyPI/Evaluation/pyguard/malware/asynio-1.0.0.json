      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Inside this method, it checks if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'). If so, it imports the 'requests' module and a 'Fernet' class from a 'fernet' package, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The code executes arbitrary, obfuscated code at install time without user consent or interaction, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the package name 'asynio' is suspiciously similar to the legitimate 'asyncio' package, suggesting typosquatting. The use of obfuscated strings for description and long description further supports evasion attempts. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook. Overall, this code enables remote code execution during installation, a critical risk vector for malware and supply chain attacks."
