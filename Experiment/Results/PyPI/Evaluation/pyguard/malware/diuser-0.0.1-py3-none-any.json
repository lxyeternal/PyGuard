      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (a Google Drive link) without any user interaction or validation, writes it to the current working directory as 'default.exe', and immediately executes it using subprocess.run with shell=True. This pattern of fetching a binary from a remote source and executing it directly is a classic hallmark of malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution of potentially untrusted and harmful payloads. There is no integrity check, user consent, or sandboxing, and the code suppresses SSL verification (verify=False), which further indicates disregard for security best practices. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: downloading and writing executable files from untrusted sources, executing them without validation, lack of user notification, and use of subprocess to run potentially malicious code. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
