      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It defines a function 'mal' that runs an infinite loop contacting a hardcoded external IP address (http://46.101.114.247:80) to fetch commands. These commands are executed on the victim's machine without user consent. The commands include arbitrary shell execution via subprocess.Popen, changing directories, and exfiltrating files from the victim's filesystem by uploading them to the attacker's server. The function is triggered automatically during the package installation process by overriding the setuptools 'install' command, which means the malicious code runs silently without user interaction. This pattern is a classic remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor behavior, enabling remote command execution and data exfiltration. The use of hardcoded attacker-controlled IP, network communication for command retrieval and data exfiltration, execution of arbitrary shell commands, and automatic execution during package installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent."
