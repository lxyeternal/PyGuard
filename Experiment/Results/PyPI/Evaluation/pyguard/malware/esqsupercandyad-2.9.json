      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed conditionally based on the absence of a directory named 'tahg' suggests stealthy execution and possible persistence or payload delivery. The comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the package name 'esqsupercandyad' with an author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raise suspicion. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command and the immediate execution of this command during the setup process is a classic hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as spawning PowerShell in hidden mode with encoded commands, obfuscation, and execution during package installation, all of which are strongly associated with malicious activity."
