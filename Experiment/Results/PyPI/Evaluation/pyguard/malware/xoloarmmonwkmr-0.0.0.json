      "malicious_behavior": "The code is malicious because it stealthily collects sensitive user information without consent and exfiltrates it to an attacker-controlled Discord webhook. Specifically, it uses the 'browser_cookie3' library to extract '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies from multiple browsers, which are authentication tokens for Roblox accounts. It then validates the cookie and, if valid, gathers detailed account information such as user ID, RAP, friends count, account age, creation date, username, Robux balance, premium status, and the user's public IP address. All this sensitive data, including the raw '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie, is sent via HTTP POST to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior constitutes credential theft and data exfiltration. The code operates without any user notification or consent, and the presence of a hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code is a credential-stealing malware targeting Roblox users."
