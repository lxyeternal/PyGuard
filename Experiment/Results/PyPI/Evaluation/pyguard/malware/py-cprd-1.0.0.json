      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary decrypted code during package installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). It imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large base64-encoded payload, which is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The obfuscated encrypted payload and the use of exec on decrypted data strongly indicate that the code is designed to run hidden, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine during package installation. The package metadata is also suspicious, with random strings for author and description, and the install hook triggers network-related imports and code execution, which is not typical for benign packages. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
