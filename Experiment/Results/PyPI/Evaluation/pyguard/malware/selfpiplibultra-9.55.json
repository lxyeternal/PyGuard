      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking a web request to a suspicious URL (noted in the comment as www.esquelesquad.rip) and executing a remote payload or performing other malicious activities. This pattern of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with hidden PowerShell execution is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or payload delivery. Additionally, the code attempts to run this payload automatically during the setup process, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during package installation without user consent. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the setup code appears to be a decoy or cover, mimicking a legitimate package setup, but the hidden PowerShell execution is the key malicious component."
