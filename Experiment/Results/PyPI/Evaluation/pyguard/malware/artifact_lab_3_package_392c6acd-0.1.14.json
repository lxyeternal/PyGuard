      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell, which is a classic malicious behavior. It creates a socket connection to a hardcoded remote host and port (6.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:19048), then redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to this socket. After that, it spawns an interactive bash shell (/bin/bash -i) connected to the remote server. This allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the victim machine, bypassing firewall restrictions by initiating an outbound connection. Such reverse shells are commonly used in malware, backdoors, and remote access trojans (RATs) to gain unauthorized control over a system. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic, and the hardcoded external address is attacker-controlled infrastructure. Therefore, this code is strongly indicative of malicious intent."
