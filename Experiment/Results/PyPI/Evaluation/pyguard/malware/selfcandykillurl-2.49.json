      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which when decoded reveals a PowerShell invocation that downloads or interacts with a suspicious URL (\"https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0\") and executes a file named \"~\\/WindowsCache.exe\". The use of a hidden PowerShell window, encoded commands, and a suspicious external URL strongly indicates stealthy execution of a potentially malicious payload. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name ('selfcandykillurl') and package directory ('modlib'), which are not typical for benign packages. The code attempts to execute this payload automatically during the setup process without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious package installation behavior. The try/except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process creation, suspicious external URL, and automatic execution during package setup confirms that this code contains malicious behavior."
