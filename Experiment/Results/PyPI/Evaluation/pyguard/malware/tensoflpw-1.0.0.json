      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description strings further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The code executes arbitrary code during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, persistence, or data exfiltration. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as code obfuscation, execution of decrypted code during install, and use of network-related modules in an install hook. Therefore, this code is malicious."
