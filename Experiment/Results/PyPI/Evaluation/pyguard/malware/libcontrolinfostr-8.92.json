      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as downloading or executing further payloads from a suspicious URL (notably, the comment references 'www.esquelesquad.rip', which is suspicious). This execution happens automatically during the import or setup phase without user interaction or consent. The presence of obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell commands executed silently, combined with the use of subprocess to spawn hidden processes, is a hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or payload delivery. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script but contains this hidden malicious payload execution, consistent with supply chain attack patterns. Therefore, this code is malicious."
