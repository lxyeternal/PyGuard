      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and may be linked to malicious actors. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscated command during the setup phase strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during package installation. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell command execution, hidden process spawning, lack of user interaction or notification, and execution during package setup/install. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
