      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it attempts to execute obfuscated PowerShell code silently without user interaction or notification. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and analysis. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated infection or detection. The presence of a suspicious author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) and a suspicious package name 'libhydracraftrand' with a comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports the malicious nature. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with encoded commands is a hallmark of stealthy malware behavior, often used for executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a setup call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is triggered automatically during import or execution, which is typical of supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code is malicious."
