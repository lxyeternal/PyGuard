      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated class name and the use of encrypted code executed during installation strongly indicate an attempt to hide malicious payload delivery. The package name and metadata appear random and meaningless, which is typical for malware trying to evade detection. The code does not perform any legitimate installation tasks beyond running this hidden payload. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with remote code execution and supply chain attack techniques."
