      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious token grabber targeting Discord and other applications. It collects sensitive user data including Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Chrome passwords, and cookies by accessing local application data directories and decrypting stored credentials using Windows APIs. It attempts to bypass security protections like Discord Token Protector and BetterDiscord integrity checks. The code kills Discord processes optionally, hides itself, and can copy itself to startup for persistence. It downloads and injects malicious JavaScript code into Discord's installation directories. The collected data and system information (IP, location, Windows product key, hardware specs) are compressed into a zip archive and exfiltrated via HTTP POST to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL controlled by the attacker. The code runs automatically on execution without user consent or notification, uses threading and asynchronous calls for stealth and efficiency, and deletes temporary files after exfiltration. These behaviors—credential theft, environment reconnaissance, persistence, code injection, and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints—are hallmark indicators of malware, specifically an information stealer and credential harvester. Therefore, this code is definitively malicious."
