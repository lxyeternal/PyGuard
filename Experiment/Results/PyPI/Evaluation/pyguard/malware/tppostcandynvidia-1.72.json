      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The encoded PowerShell command appears obfuscated and is not a typical benign operation. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name 'tppostcandynvidia' which does not correspond to any known legitimate library. The presence of this obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during the setup phase strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during package installation. No legitimate user interaction or notification is present, and the code suppresses exceptions silently, further indicating malicious intent."
