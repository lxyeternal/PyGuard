      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It contains extensive base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and executed dynamically using exec, which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique used by malware. The code performs environment discovery, collects sensitive information such as user identity, system details, and potentially browser cookies or other credentials, and exfiltrates this data to hardcoded, suspicious external servers (e.g., IP 134.209.85.64:9090). It also downloads and executes additional code from remote sources without user consent, including a 'bypass.py' script and other payloads from non-official URLs. The use of threading to execute code after path existence checks, execution of shell commands with obfuscated PowerShell commands, and the presence of setup hooks that trigger code execution during package installation further confirm its malicious intent. The code lacks any legitimate user interaction, validation, or error handling, and attempts to evade detection by running in hidden modes and self-deleting. These behaviors collectively indicate that the code is designed for unauthorized data collection, remote code execution, and potential system compromise, consistent with supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware."
