      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to execute hidden, potentially malicious PowerShell commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a known method to evade detection and hide the true intent of the command. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this hidden PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade repeated detection or to target specific environments. The presence of a suspicious author name 'EsqueleSquad' and an unusual package name 'selfLGTBproofgrand' further raises suspicion. The use of try/except blocks to silently ignore errors and the execution of hidden shell commands during the setup process strongly indicate malicious intent, likely as part of a supply chain attack or malware installation routine. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and lack of user consent or transparency."
