      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command class that overrides the run() method to execute arbitrary decrypted code during package installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). Specifically, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a base64-encoded payload, which is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The obfuscated class name, meaningless description strings, and the use of exec on decrypted data strongly indicate malicious intent. The code leverages the setuptools install hook to run hidden payloads during installation, which is a known vector for malware distribution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
