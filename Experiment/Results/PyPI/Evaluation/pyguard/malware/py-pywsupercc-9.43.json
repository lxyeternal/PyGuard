      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated in base64, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a typical stealth technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. This pattern of executing obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup is a known supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and potential further payload delivery without user consent or interaction."
