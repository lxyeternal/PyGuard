      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive user data related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet by accessing multiple wallet-related files and configuration files from the user's AppData roaming directory and common user folders (Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It then archives these files into a ZIP file named after the user. The script gathers the victim's username and external IP address via HTTP requests to ip-api.com, constructs a message including a Telegram bot token and chat ID, and sends both the message and the ZIP archive to a Telegram chat controlled by the attacker. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration of sensitive wallet credentials and secrets without user consent. The use of hardcoded Telegram bot tokens and chat IDs for data exfiltration, combined with the stealthy packaging of wallet files and automated network transmission, is a classic hallmark of credential-stealing malware. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the script attempts to delete the ZIP archive after sending, indicating an attempt to cover tracks. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed for theft of cryptocurrency wallet data."
