      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or consent, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the payload if it does not exist, indicating evasion or persistence behavior. The presence of a suspicious hardcoded URL in the encoded command (www.esquelesquad.rip) suggests a connection to an attacker-controlled resource. This pattern of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote resource referencing is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware that executes code during package installation. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script, further indicating an attempt to disguise malicious activity within a seemingly benign package installation."
