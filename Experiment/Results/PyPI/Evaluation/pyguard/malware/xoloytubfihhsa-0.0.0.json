      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a credential stealer targeting Roblox accounts. It uses the 'browser_cookie3' library to silently extract the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie from multiple browsers without user consent. This cookie is a sensitive authentication token that can be used to hijack Roblox accounts. The script then validates the cookie using the 'robloxpy' library and, if valid, collects detailed user information such as UserID, RAP, friends count, account age, creation date, username, Robux balance, premium status, and the user's public IP address. All this sensitive information, including the stolen '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie, is exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL controlled by an attacker. The script operates without any user interaction or notification, and it terminates if the cookie is invalid, preventing further execution. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URLs, automated extraction of browser cookies, validation of stolen credentials, and immediate exfiltration of sensitive user data are strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with credential-stealing malware."
