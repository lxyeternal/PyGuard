      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and attempts to invoke a web request to a Dropbox domain, which is a known tactic for downloading or executing remote payloads. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during the package setup phase (without user interaction or notification) is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The package name and author information appear suspicious and likely fake. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated remote code during installation, which is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malicious intent."
