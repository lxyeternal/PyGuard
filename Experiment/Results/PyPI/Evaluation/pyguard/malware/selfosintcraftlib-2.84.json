      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and CREATE_NO_WINDOW creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'Windo​wsCache.exe' from that URL. This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution to download and run a remote executable without user interaction or notification is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for payload delivery, persistence, or further compromise. Additionally, the code attempts this execution during the import/setup phase, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious packages that execute code on installation or import. The presence of a suspicious author email and package name further supports the malicious intent."
