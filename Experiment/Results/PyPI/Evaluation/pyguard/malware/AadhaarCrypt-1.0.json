      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, package name, and current working directory, then encodes this data in base64 and hex format. It constructs domain names by appending this encoded data to a suspicious domain ('.sub.deliverycontent.online') and performs multiple 'ping' shell commands to these dynamically generated domains, which is an unusual and suspicious network activity pattern. Furthermore, it sends HTTP POST and GET requests to hardcoded, suspicious external domains ('www.deliverycontent.online') with the encoded system information as payloads, without any user interaction or notification. This behavior is a classic example of automated data exfiltration and host fingerprinting to attacker-controlled servers. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding and hex encoding), multiple network communication methods (urllib, requests), and shell command execution for network probing strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent involved, and the pattern matches known malware behaviors for environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration."
