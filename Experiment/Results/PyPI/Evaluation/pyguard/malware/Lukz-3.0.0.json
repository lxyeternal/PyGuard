      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation techniques including base64 encoding, base32 decoding, zlib compression, and marshal deserialization to conceal its true functionality. The code imports cryptography's Fernet module and decrypts a large hex-encoded payload, which is then base64 and base32 decoded multiple times before being executed dynamically via exec. This multi-layered decoding and execution pattern is a classic hallmark of malware attempting to evade static analysis and detection. The code does not contain any user interaction or legitimate business logic and immediately executes the decrypted payload, which is highly suspicious. The obfuscated variable and function names, combined with the use of dynamic code execution on decoded and decrypted data, strongly suggest that the code is designed to run hidden or unauthorized operations. Such behavior is typical of credential stealers, remote code execution backdoors, or other forms of malware. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
