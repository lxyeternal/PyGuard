      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It conditionally imports modules like 'pip' and 'win32com', attempts to create and write files in user directories, and uses Windows COM interfaces to create shortcuts and execute commands. The code performs environment checks, writes files to user paths, and executes shell commands dynamically. The obfuscation, combined with the use of Windows-specific automation (COM Dispatch), file system manipulation, and dynamic execution during package setup, strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware payload delivery. The code's structure and operations match multiple critical risk indicators such as code obfuscation, environment discovery, file writing in user directories, dynamic execution, and use of Windows COM for persistence or execution, all without user consent or legitimate purpose."
