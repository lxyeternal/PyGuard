      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation with meaningless variable names and encoded strings, which are decoded and then executed dynamically via eval. The code imports sys and checks Python version to adapt decoding logic, then defines functions that decode obfuscated strings and immediately eval the decoded content, a classic pattern for executing hidden or dynamically generated code. The presence of eval on decoded strings without any validation is a critical risk and a hallmark of malware. Furthermore, the code uses setuptools setup() with obfuscated parameters, which suggests it is designed to execute malicious payloads during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The code also imports sys.version_info multiple times and uses global variables and complex string manipulations to hide its intent. The obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns, combined with the use of setup() for code execution, strongly indicate that this code is designed to execute unauthorized or harmful actions on the host system without user consent. There is no legitimate user interaction or business logic, and the code is structured to evade detection and analysis. Therefore, this code is malicious."
