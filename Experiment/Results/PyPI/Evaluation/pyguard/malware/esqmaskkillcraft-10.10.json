      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the command suggests an evasion or persistence mechanism. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious names such as 'esqmaskkillcraft' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which are uncommon and potentially linked to malicious actors. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process creation, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware payload delivery."
