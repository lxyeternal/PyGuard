      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then launches this hidden PowerShell command. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command, combined with silent execution in the background without user interaction or notification, is a classic hallmark of malware. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks or malware that executes arbitrary or harmful code during package installation or setup. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during the setup phase is suspicious and malicious. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, especially without user consent or transparency."
