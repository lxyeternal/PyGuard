      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated variable and function names, which is a common evasion technique. The function 'l111_cringe_' performs character code manipulations and then uses eval on the resulting string, indicating dynamic code execution from obfuscated data. Most critically, the code executes a shell command during package setup that downloads a shell script from a suspicious external GitHub URL (https://github.com/nedog123/files/raw/main/aza-ob.sh) into /tmp/gay.sh, sets its permissions to be fully executable, and immediately executes it. This sequence is a classic pattern of remote code retrieval and execution without user consent, typical of malware or supply chain attacks. The use of setuptools setup() function to trigger this behavior during package installation further confirms the malicious intent, as legitimate packages do not execute arbitrary shell commands downloading and running external scripts during install. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to execute unauthorized code on the victim system."
