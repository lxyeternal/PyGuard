      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It conditionally imports modules like 'pip' and 'win32com', attempts to create and write files in user directories, and uses Windows COM objects to create shortcuts. It performs environment variable access (e.g., APPDATA), directory creation, file writing, and scanning of directories for files with suspicious extensions. The code also checks for administrative privileges and uses Windows-specific APIs. The obfuscation and the behavior of writing files to user directories, creating shortcuts, and potentially executing code during package installation strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern matches known supply chain attacks and malware that execute code during Python package installation to compromise the system, collect information, or deploy payloads without user consent."
