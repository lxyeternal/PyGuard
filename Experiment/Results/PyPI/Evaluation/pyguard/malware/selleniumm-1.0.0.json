      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing obfuscated code during package installation is a hallmark of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The package name 'selleniumm' appears to be a typo-squatted variant of 'selenium', which is a common tactic used by attackers to trick users into installing malicious packages. The obfuscation of class names and the use of encrypted payloads further indicate an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for executing decrypted code during installation, especially without user notification. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware."
