      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with known malware patterns. Key malicious characteristics include: 1) The code writes base64-decoded, obfuscated Python scripts ('main.cpython-39.py' and 'scripts.cpython-39.py') into a hidden temporary directory under the user's AppData local temp path, which is a common staging area for malware. 2) It then executes these scripts in hidden subprocesses using 'pythonw.exe' with flags to suppress windows, indicating stealth execution. 3) The decoded payloads contain extensive code that collects sensitive user and system information, including environment variables, user profile data, browser cookies (via 'browser_cookie3'), and system details. 4) The code performs automated data exfiltration by sending collected data via HTTP POST requests to suspicious or hardcoded external endpoints, including IP addresses and non-standard domains, without user consent or interaction. 5) It uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding and zlib compression combined with dynamic execution (exec) of decoded data, which is a hallmark of malware attempting to evade static detection. 6) The code hooks into the package installation process (setup.py) to trigger execution automatically during install or build, a known supply chain attack vector. 7) It spawns multiple subprocesses and threads to run secondary payloads and perform network communication covertly. 8) The presence of suspicious class and function names, combined with the collection and exfiltration of browser cookies, user credentials, and system information, strongly indicates credential stealing and information gathering intent. 9) The code attempts to create and delete files and directories in user and system paths, further indicating persistence or cleanup behavior typical of malware. 10) There is no legitimate user interaction, notification, or business logic justifying these actions. Taken together, these behaviors confirm that the code is malicious, designed to stealthily collect sensitive data and exfiltrate it to attacker-controlled servers, leveraging obfuscation and execution during package installation to evade detection."
