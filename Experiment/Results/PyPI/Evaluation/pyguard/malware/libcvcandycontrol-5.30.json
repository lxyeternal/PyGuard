      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the command suggests an evasion or persistence mechanism. Additionally, the setup() call includes suspicious metadata such as the author 'EsqueleSquad' and an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which aligns with the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip', a suspicious domain. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), and the context of a Python package setup script strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware installation routines."
