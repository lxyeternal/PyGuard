      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to execute hidden, potentially harmful commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands, indicating an attempt to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to evade repeated detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the package name 'selfcraftpaypalultra' authored by 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent or at least a suspicious origin. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, enhancing stealth. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window, conditional execution based on directory existence, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with malware or a supply chain attack vector."
