      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The use of obfuscated (Base64-encoded) PowerShell commands executed silently during package setup or installation is a hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a cover or delivery mechanism. Given these factors and the known risk indicators, this code is malicious."
