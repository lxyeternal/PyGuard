      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden) and uses the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to suppress any console window, which is typical for stealthy execution. The comment '# www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled identity. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. This pattern of executing obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup is a known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
