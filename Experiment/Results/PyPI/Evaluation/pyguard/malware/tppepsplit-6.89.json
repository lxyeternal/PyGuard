      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed in hidden mode is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, often used for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading and executing further malicious payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload execution is triggered automatically during import or installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscation (Base64 encoding) and hidden execution without user consent or legitimate purpose confirms the malicious intent."
