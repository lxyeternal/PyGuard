      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that executes automatically during package installation. It performs the following suspicious and potentially malicious actions: 1) It creates directories inside the user's Windows Startup folder and another folder named 'Powerpoint' under the Start Menu Programs path, which are unusual locations for package installation files and suggest persistence mechanisms. 2) It clones two GitHub repositories into these directories, one into the Startup 'boot' folder and another into the 'Powerpoint' folder. This means it downloads and places external code on the user's system without explicit user consent or interaction. 3) It moves a Python script ('test.py') from the cloned repository in the Startup folder to the parent Startup directory, likely to ensure it runs on system startup. 4) It immediately executes an executable ('main.exe') from the cloned 'defonotagrabber' repository inside the 'Powerpoint' folder, which is a direct execution of potentially untrusted code. 5) All these actions happen silently during package installation, without user notification or consent, and involve writing to system startup locations and executing external binaries. These behaviors are classic indicators of malware, including persistence establishment, remote code retrieval, and execution of untrusted payloads. The use of setuptools install hook to trigger these actions is a known supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
