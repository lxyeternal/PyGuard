      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally (only if the 'tahg' directory does not exist) suggests stealth and persistence mechanisms. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a well-known hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading and running further malicious payloads. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup but includes this covert execution, indicating a supply chain attack or malicious package installation behavior."
