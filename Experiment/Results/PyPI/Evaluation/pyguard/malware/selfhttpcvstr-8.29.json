      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, a common stealth technique. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely executes a hidden or obfuscated payload, as indicated by the encoded string and the use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand'. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup is a classic supply chain attack pattern and is strongly associated with malware."
