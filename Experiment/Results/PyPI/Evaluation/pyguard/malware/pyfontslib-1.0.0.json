      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware and information exfiltration tools. It collects extensive sensitive information from the victim's system, including environment variables, system information (e.g., Windows key, hardware UUID, RAM, disk size), browser data (passwords, cookies, history, credit cards), Discord tokens, Minecraft and Roblox data, and clipboard contents. The code decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows APIs and AES decryption, indicating intent to extract protected credentials. It also monitors and replaces cryptocurrency wallet addresses in the clipboard to redirect funds to attacker-controlled addresses, a classic clipboard hijacking technique. The malware attempts to evade detection by checking for virtual machine environments, blacklisted usernames, hostnames, IPs, and running processes related to debugging or analysis tools, and kills Discord-related processes to avoid interference. It exfiltrates all collected data and files by packaging them into zip archives and sending them to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL (https://kekwltd.ru/relay/bluescreen), which is attacker-controlled. The code runs stealthily without user interaction, installs required dependencies silently, and persists by copying itself to the Windows startup folder. It uses threading to run multiple data collection and exfiltration tasks concurrently. The presence of obfuscated variable and function names, base64 decoding, and direct network communication to suspicious domains further confirm malicious intent. Overall, this code is a sophisticated information stealer designed to silently harvest and exfiltrate sensitive user data and credentials to an attacker-controlled server."
