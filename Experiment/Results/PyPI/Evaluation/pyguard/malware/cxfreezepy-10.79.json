      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses a highly obfuscated exec statement that dynamically constructs and executes code from a large list of numeric values converted to characters. This obfuscation technique is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the actual code being run. The use of exec on dynamically generated code without any user interaction or validation is a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the code is placed in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The obfuscation and execution pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and execution during package installation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
