      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords, and other sensitive user data. It collects environment information such as IP address, username, and geolocation, then extracts Discord tokens and browser data (cookies, passwords) from various installed browsers and Discord clients by decrypting encrypted data using Windows APIs. The code uploads stolen data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL and also uploads files to anonymous file hosting services. It uses threading to perform data collection and exfiltration concurrently. The code installs required dependencies silently if missing, suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, and kills processes to access locked files. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URLs, automated extraction of sensitive credentials without user consent, decryption of encrypted browser data, and exfiltration to external servers are definitive indicators of malicious behavior. This code is a classic example of a malicious information stealer designed to silently harvest and exfiltrate user credentials and tokens."
