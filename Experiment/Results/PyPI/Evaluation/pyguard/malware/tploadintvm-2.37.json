      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and downloads or executes a payload from a Dropbox URL, which is a common technique for remote code execution and payload delivery. The presence of obfuscation (base64 encoding), execution of PowerShell in hidden mode, and the use of subprocess to run this command without user interaction or notification are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious author and email information ('EsqueleSquad', 'tahgoficial@proton.me'), which aligns with the suspicious domain in the command. The code attempts to execute this payload during the setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. All these factors combined confirm that the code is malicious."
