      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware and information exfiltration tools. It collects sensitive user information such as system details, Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, credit card data, and gaming-related credentials (Minecraft, Roblox). It uses obfuscated and encoded data, decrypts browser-stored secrets using Windows APIs, and exfiltrates this data to attacker-controlled endpoints (e.g., https://kekwltd.ru/relay). The code also includes clipboard monitoring and replacement of cryptocurrency wallet addresses to hijack user funds. It attempts to evade detection by killing processes related to Discord and debugging tools, checks for virtual machine environments, and hides its activity by copying itself to startup folders for persistence. The use of threading, subprocess calls, and network requests to suspicious domains without user consent further confirms its malicious intent. Overall, this code is a sophisticated information stealer designed to silently harvest and transmit confidential user data to a remote attacker."
