      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command in a Python package setup script that, upon installation, automatically downloads an executable file named 'DigitalPulse.exe' from a hardcoded, non-standard external URL ('https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe') without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately executes this downloaded file on Windows platforms using a shell command ('start DigitalPulse.exe'). This behavior is a classic hallmark of malicious activity, specifically a supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code is fetched and executed during package installation. The absence of any validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic, combined with the automatic download and execution of an external binary, strongly indicates malicious intent. Such patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are used to deliver and execute potentially harmful payloads on the victim system."
