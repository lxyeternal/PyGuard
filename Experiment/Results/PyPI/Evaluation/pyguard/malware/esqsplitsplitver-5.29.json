      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands, commonly used in malware to evade detection. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is not human-readable and is used to hide the true intent of the command. The command attempts to invoke a web request to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and output it to a file named \"~/WindowsCache.exe\", then execute it. This behavior indicates downloading and executing a remote payload without user consent or notification, a hallmark of malicious activity. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which may be an evasion or persistence technique. The presence of this code in a setup script further indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, remote payload download, and execution without user interaction confirms the code is malicious."
