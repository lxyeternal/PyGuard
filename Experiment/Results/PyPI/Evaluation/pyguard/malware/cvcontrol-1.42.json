      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware to evade detection. The base64-encoded command likely contains a PowerShell script that performs unauthorized or malicious actions, such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means the malicious payload executes automatically during package installation without user consent or interaction, a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious payload. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
