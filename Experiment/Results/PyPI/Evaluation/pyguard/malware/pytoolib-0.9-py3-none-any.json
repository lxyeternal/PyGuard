      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive user data. It collects environment information such as IP address, username, and geolocation, then extracts Discord tokens from various local storage paths, decrypts browser-stored passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI, and gathers files from user directories. The stolen data is exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code uses obfuscated function and variable names, multi-threading for stealth, and uploads stolen data to anonymous file hosting services. It also forcibly terminates processes to access locked files and zips targeted directories for exfiltration. The behavior includes automated data collection without user consent, environment reconnaissance, credential decryption, and network exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints. These are hallmark characteristics of malicious information-stealing malware."
