      "malicious_behavior": "The code reads potentially sensitive user configuration files related to gaming and Minecraft accounts from the user's home directory and roaming AppData paths without user interaction or consent. It then decodes a base64-encoded URL to retrieve a JSON object containing a webhook URL, which is attacker-controlled. The code proceeds to send the contents of these configuration files via an HTTP POST request to this webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating user data. The use of base64 encoding to hide the remote URL, the targeting of user-specific credential/configuration files, and the automated, silent network transmission to an external webhook are strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential or data stealing malware."
