      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only if it does not exist, it executes the PowerShell command. The encoded command likely downloads or executes further payloads or performs unauthorized actions. The presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious code during package installation. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during setup strongly indicates this code is designed to perform stealthy, unauthorized actions on the host system."
