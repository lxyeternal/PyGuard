It then immediately executes this script in a new Python interpreter process. This pattern of dynamically fetching and executing remote code during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The use of a temporary file to hide the payload, the lack of any legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the direct execution of untrusted code from an external source strongly indicate malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically writes a Python script to a temporary file that contains an exec call to execute code fetched from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/xnouv/raw). This remote code is downloaded at runtime and executed without any validation or user consent, which is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The script then launches a new Python interpreter process (using the 'pythonw.exe' executable variant to run without a console window) to execute the temporary file, effectively running the remote code stealthily in the background. This pattern of fetching and executing remote code dynamically, combined with obfuscated imports and use of temporary files, is strongly associated with malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution, evasion of detection, and potential payload delivery. There is no legitimate user interaction, no integrity checks, and the remote URL is not a known trusted source, all of which further confirm the malicious intent."
