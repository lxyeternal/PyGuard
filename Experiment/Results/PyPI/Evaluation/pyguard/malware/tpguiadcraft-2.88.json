      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and CREATE_NO_WINDOW creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) which appears to be a remote payload download or execution. The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command, the hidden execution, and the suspicious external URL are all classic hallmarks of malware, especially supply chain attacks or installer-based payload delivery. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script but silently triggers this hidden payload execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
