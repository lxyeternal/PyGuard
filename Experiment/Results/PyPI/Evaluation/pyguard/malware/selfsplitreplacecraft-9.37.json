      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware tactic. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The presence of a suspicious URL in a comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further suggests malicious intent. The use of such obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup or installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution without user consent. The rest of the code is a typical setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Therefore, this code is malicious."
