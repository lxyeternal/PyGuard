      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious Discord token stealer. It searches for Discord and various Chromium-based browser user data directories on a Windows system, reads encrypted Discord tokens from local storage files, decrypts them using the Windows CryptUnprotectData API and AES-GCM, and then validates these tokens by querying Discord's API. Upon successful validation, it collects sensitive user information including username, user ID, email, phone number, 2FA status, Nitro subscription details, as well as system information such as IP address, PC username, and computer name. It then exfiltrates all this data, including the decrypted tokens, to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user consent or notification. The code uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding of tokens and encrypted keys, and performs network communication and subprocess calls stealthily. These behaviors—unauthorized credential extraction, decryption of protected data, automated data exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints, and lack of user interaction—are hallmark indicators of malicious credential-stealing malware."
