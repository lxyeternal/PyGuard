      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction or consent, writes it to a temporary file, and immediately executes it using subprocess.call. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious behavior because it enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted remote source. The code is embedded in a setup script, which means it could be executed during package installation, a known vector for supply chain attacks. There is no validation, user notification, or integrity check of the downloaded executable, and the URL is not associated with any known trusted source. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as automated download and execution of remote payloads, lack of user consent, and execution during package installation, all of which are hallmark signs of malware."

This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious behavior because it enables remote code execution of potentially untrusted and harmful binaries. The absence of any user interaction, validation, or notification before execution, combined with the direct download and execution of a binary from an external source, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including automated retrieval and execution of untrusted code, lack of user consent, and execution of remote payloads. Such behavior is commonly used in malware propagation, payload delivery, and system compromise."
