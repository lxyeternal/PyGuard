      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell is run with the window style set to hidden and with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a typical stealth behavior. The encoded command appears to invoke a PowerShell script that likely performs network or system actions (the decoded command references Invoke-WebRequest to download or execute a file from a suspicious URL). This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup/install is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious payload delivery. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call wrapped in try/except, which is benign, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
