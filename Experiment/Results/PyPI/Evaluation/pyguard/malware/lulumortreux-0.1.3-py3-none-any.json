      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive user data. It collects environment information such as IP address and username, decrypts stored browser passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI, and extracts Discord tokens from various local storage paths. The code then exfiltrates this sensitive information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without user consent. It also searches user directories for files with keywords related to accounts and secrets, uploads them to anonymous file hosting services, and reports these findings. The use of threading for stealthy data collection, subprocess calls to kill processes, copying and decrypting browser databases, and automated network exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints are all hallmark behaviors of malicious credential-stealing malware. The code operates silently in the background, uses obfuscation techniques (e.g., base64 decoding, encrypted keys), and does not require user interaction, further confirming its malicious intent."
