      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation techniques including base64 encoding, base32 decoding, zlib decompression, and marshal deserialization to hide its true functionality. The code imports cryptography's Fernet for decryption, decrypts a large hex-encoded payload, and then executes dynamically decoded and decrypted code via exec. This pattern of multi-layered decoding and immediate execution of hidden payloads is a classic hallmark of malware designed to evade static analysis. The code does not include any user interaction or legitimate business logic, and the obfuscation is excessive and unnecessary for benign purposes. The use of exec on decompressed and decrypted data without validation is a critical risk, enabling arbitrary code execution. Given these factors and the extensive obfuscation combined with dynamic execution, this code is almost certainly malicious."
