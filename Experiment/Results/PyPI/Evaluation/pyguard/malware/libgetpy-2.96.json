      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or performing system compromise. Additionally, the author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and the commented URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) are suspicious and may be linked to malicious infrastructure. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with hidden PowerShell execution is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution and payload delivery. The rest of the code (setup call) appears benign but is used as a cover or delivery mechanism. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and should be treated as malicious."
