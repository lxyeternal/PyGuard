      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated PowerShell payloads. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command, which likely performs unauthorized actions without user consent or notification. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command further supports the malicious intent. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means it could be executed automatically during package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks. These factors combined match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including stealth execution, obfuscation, and execution during installation without user interaction."
