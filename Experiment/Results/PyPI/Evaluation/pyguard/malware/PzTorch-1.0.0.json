      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Inside this method, it checks if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'). If so, it imports the 'requests' module and a 'Fernet' class from a 'fernet' package, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing obfuscated, encrypted code during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of exec on decrypted data without any validation or user interaction, combined with the execution triggered automatically during installation, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the package name 'PzTorch' and the obfuscated class name suggest attempts to evade detection. The presence of network-related imports (requests) and cryptographic decryption (Fernet) in an install hook further supports the conclusion that this code is designed to execute hidden malicious payloads on Windows systems during installation."
