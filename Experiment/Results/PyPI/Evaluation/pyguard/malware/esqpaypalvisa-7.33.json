      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window, CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag), which is a classic technique used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary code without user consent or interaction. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated infection or detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name ('esqpaypalvisa') further support malicious intent. The setup call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, and suspicious naming conventions aligns with known malware patterns, indicating that this code is malicious."
