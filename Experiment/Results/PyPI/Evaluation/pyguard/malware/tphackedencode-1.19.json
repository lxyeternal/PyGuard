      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized or harmful actions, as suggested by the suspicious domain 'www.esquelesquad.rip' in the comment and the obfuscation of the command. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution is a well-known hallmark of malware, often used for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code attempts to run this payload automatically during the setup process without user interaction or consent, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the setup code appears benign but serves as a cover or delivery mechanism. Therefore, this code is malicious."
