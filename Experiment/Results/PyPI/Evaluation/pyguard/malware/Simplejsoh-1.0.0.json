      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command class with an obfuscated name that overrides the run() method. Inside run(), it checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This means arbitrary code is decrypted and executed at install time without user interaction or consent. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows execution of hidden payloads. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description strings further indicate evasion. The code executes this payload during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) in install hooks, combined with exec on decrypted data, strongly suggests this package is designed to run hidden malicious code on Windows systems during installation."
