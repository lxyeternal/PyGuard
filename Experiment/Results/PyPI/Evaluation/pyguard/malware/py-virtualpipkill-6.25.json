      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests stealth and evasion. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads, often used in malware for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further malicious code. Additionally, the package name 'py-virtualpipkill' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and potentially typosquatted or attacker-controlled. The code runs this payload automatically during setup without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The presence of a hardcoded, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently in the background during installation strongly indicates malicious intent."
