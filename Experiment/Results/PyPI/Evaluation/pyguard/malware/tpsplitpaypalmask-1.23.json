      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (Base64 encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated and not directly visible, which is a common tactic in malware to hide intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The presence of a suspicious comment with a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The setup call appears to be a decoy or a cover for the malicious payload, as it is wrapped in a try/except block and does not perform any legitimate packaging tasks related to the suspicious subprocess call. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, conditional execution based on directory existence, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates that this code is malicious."
