      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) that is executed without user interaction or notification. The command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a stealthy check to avoid repeated execution. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads, commonly observed in malware. Additionally, the author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and the commented URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' are suspicious and may be associated with malicious actors. The rest of the code is a setup call for a package with a suspicious name 'tppullpyproof' and a package 'modlib', which could be a disguise. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup, lack of user consent, and hidden execution strongly indicates this code is malicious."
