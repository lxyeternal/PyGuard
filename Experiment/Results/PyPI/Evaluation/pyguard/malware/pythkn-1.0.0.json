      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Inside this method, it checks if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet with a hardcoded key. This decrypted payload is not visible in the source and is executed immediately during package installation without user interaction or consent. The use of exec() on decrypted data during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The package name 'pythkn' and obfuscated class name further suggest evasion attempts. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious payload execution context. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
