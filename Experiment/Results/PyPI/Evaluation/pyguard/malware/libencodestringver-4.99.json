      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before launching the hidden PowerShell process, combined with the obfuscated encoded command, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the setup() call with a suspicious package name and author email linked to 'EsqueleSquad' (a known threat actor or malware group) suggests this code is part of a supply chain attack or malicious package installation script. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide execution and the encoded PowerShell command are hallmark indicators of malware attempting stealthy execution, possibly to download or execute further payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the victim system."
