      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command appears to invoke a web request to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and outputs to a file named '~\\WindowsCache.exe', then executes it. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution, downloading an executable from a non-standard URL, saving it under a suspicious name, and running it without user interaction is a classic hallmark of malware, specifically a downloader or dropper. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious author information and a suspicious package name, which may be an attempt to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a potentially malicious payload on Windows systems during package installation or execution."
