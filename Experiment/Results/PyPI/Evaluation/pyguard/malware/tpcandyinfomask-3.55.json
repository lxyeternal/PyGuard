      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated in base64 UTF-16LE encoding, which is a common technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a known stealth technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a cover or delivery mechanism. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup, stealth execution, and lack of user interaction strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware installation routines."
