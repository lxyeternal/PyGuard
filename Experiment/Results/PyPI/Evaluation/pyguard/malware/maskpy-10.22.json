      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during the setup phase (package installation) is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as legitimate setup scripts rarely execute hidden shell commands with encoded payloads. This pattern matches known supply chain attack techniques where malicious code is executed during package installation to run unauthorized commands or payloads. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
