      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated execution or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a typical stealth technique. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used to execute payloads, download additional malware, or perform system compromise covertly. Furthermore, this code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscated payload is a critical risk indicator of malware behavior."
