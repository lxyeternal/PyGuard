      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and dynamic code execution via eval and exec. It imports modules and functions in an obfuscated manner and decodes a large base64-encoded payload which is then decompressed and executed dynamically. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malicious code designed to evade static analysis and hide its true intent. The code does not show any legitimate user interaction or business logic and immediately executes decoded and decompressed data, which is a strong indicator of malware. The obfuscation, combined with dynamic execution of decoded payloads, strongly suggests that the code is intended for malicious purposes such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise."
