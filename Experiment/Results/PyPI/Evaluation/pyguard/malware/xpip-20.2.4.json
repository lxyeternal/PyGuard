      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system environment information including hostname, username, package name, and current working directory, then encodes this data in base64 and further hex-encodes it. It constructs domain names by appending this encoded data to suspicious, hardcoded domains ('.sub.deliverycontent.online' and 'www.deliverycontent.online'). It then performs multiple 'ping' shell commands to these dynamically generated domains, which is an unusual and suspicious method of data exfiltration via DNS queries. Additionally, the code sends HTTP POST and GET requests to the hardcoded 'deliverycontent.online' domain, transmitting the encoded system information without any user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding and hex encoding), hardcoded suspicious domains, automated network communication, and shell command execution for data exfiltration are strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern matches known malware techniques for host fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure."
