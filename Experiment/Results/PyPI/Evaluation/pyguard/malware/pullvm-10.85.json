      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an -EncodedCommand argument. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell command string, which is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window, a known stealth technique. This behavior is embedded in a try/except block without any user notification or interaction, which is typical for malicious payloads that execute silently during package installation or setup. The rest of the code is a standard-looking setup() call for a Python package, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation. Given these factors, the code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution triggered during package setup, all of which are hallmark traits of malware."
