      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It abuses the setuptools installation hooks (PostDevelopCommand and PostInstallCommand) to execute arbitrary code during package installation or development setup. Specifically, it downloads an executable file named 'MCCheat.exe' from a hardcoded external URL hosted on Discord's CDN, writes it to the current working directory without user consent, and then executes it using a shell command that sets an environment variable and starts the executable. This pattern of downloading and executing an untrusted binary during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. There is no user interaction, validation, or notification before this potentially harmful payload is executed. The use of a hardcoded external URL to fetch an executable and immediate execution without integrity checks or user consent is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
