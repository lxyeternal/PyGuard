This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and transmission to an attacker-controlled endpoint, which is a hallmark of malicious activity. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration, the lack of user notification or consent, and the automated, repeated background operation all strongly indicate malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module named 'screenshitterr' which is a suspicious, typo-squatted name resembling 'screenshitter'. Such typosquatted or unusual package names are a known indicator of malicious intent. The import statement alone, without any further code, suggests that the module may execute code upon import, which is a common technique used by malware to trigger malicious payloads automatically. Given the suspicious module name and the absence of any benign context or user interaction, this import strongly indicates malicious behavior."
