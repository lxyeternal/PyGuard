      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system and network information including hostname, current working directory, local IP addresses, and public WAN IP address without any user interaction or consent. It then encodes this information into a hex string and sends it via DNS queries to a suspicious, hardcoded domain 'hte1ck6lvk1ktcuxl0x8jfgeu50vok.burpcollaborator.net', which is a known domain used for out-of-band interaction testing and often abused by attackers for data exfiltration. The use of DNS queries for data exfiltration is a common stealth technique in malware to bypass network monitoring. The code also suppresses user notification and performs network communication automatically. These behaviors align with typical malicious patterns of covert data collection and exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior."
