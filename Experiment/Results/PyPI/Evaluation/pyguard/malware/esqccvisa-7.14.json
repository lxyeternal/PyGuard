      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command, the use of subprocess to execute it silently, and the check for a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution) are classic hallmarks of malware attempting stealthy execution. Additionally, the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the suspicious package metadata (author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', package name 'esqccvisa') further support malicious intent. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, enabling execution of malicious payloads during package installation. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands on the host system, which is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malware."
