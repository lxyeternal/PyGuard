      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It performs conditional checks on sys.argv inputs and platform, then enters loops with large numeric conditions that control execution flow. The code imports modules like pip and win32com.client.Dispatch dynamically, attempts to create and write files in user directories (using environment variables like APPDATA), and uses COM objects to create Windows shortcuts. It also walks through directories, searches for files with suspicious extensions, and creates shortcuts pointing to those files, which is a common persistence or propagation technique. The obfuscation and dynamic import patterns, combined with file system manipulation in user/system directories, and the use of Windows COM interfaces to create shortcuts, strongly indicate malicious intent. The code appears to execute during package setup, which is a known supply chain attack vector. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscation, persistence mechanisms, and execution during installation without user consent."
