      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution, potentially for downloading or executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be a persistence or evasion mechanism. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks to execute malicious code during package installation. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
