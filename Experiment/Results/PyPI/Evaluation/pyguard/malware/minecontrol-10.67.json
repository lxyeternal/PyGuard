      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a typical stealth technique. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently during the setup phase (package installation) is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious payload delivery. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during installation strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a package setup script to spawn hidden PowerShell processes with encoded commands without user interaction or notification. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads during package installation."
