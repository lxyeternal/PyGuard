      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates stealthy execution without user notification. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindoCache.exe', which is a typical pattern for downloading and running a malicious payload. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a non-standard package name, which may be used to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, conditional execution based on file system state, and downloading/executing a remote payload is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware installation routines."
