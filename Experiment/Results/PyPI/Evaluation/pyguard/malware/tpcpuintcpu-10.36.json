      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a typical stealth behavior. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call from distutils.core, which appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors, possibly to hide the malicious payload execution failures. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script, stealth process creation, and conditional execution based on file system state are strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware installation routines."
