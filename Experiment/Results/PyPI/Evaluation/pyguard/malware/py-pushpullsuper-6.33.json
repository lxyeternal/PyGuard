      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification, and the use of '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (cdnd.discordapp.com) and a path that appears to be a remote resource, indicating potential download or execution of further payloads. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to execute hidden code, possibly for payload delivery, persistence, or further compromise. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
