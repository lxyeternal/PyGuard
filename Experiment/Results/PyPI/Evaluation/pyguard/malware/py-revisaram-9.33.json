      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command, combined with silent execution in the background, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further suggest malicious or unauthorized activity. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. Overall, this pattern matches known malware behaviors involving obfuscated, hidden execution of remote or encoded payloads during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector."
