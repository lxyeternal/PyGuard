      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to avoid user visibility, which is a typical stealth technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further suggests malicious intent. The setup() call appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except pass block, which may be used to suppress errors and hide malicious activity during package installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and conditional execution strongly indicates this code is designed for malicious purposes, likely to execute a hidden payload or perform unauthorized actions on the victim system."
