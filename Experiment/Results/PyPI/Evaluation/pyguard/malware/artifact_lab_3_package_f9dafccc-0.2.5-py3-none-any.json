      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to retrieve an authentication token from the Google Compute Engine metadata service at the well-known internal IP address 169.254.169.254, which is a sensitive credential endpoint. It then sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. This behavior constitutes automated, silent exfiltration of sensitive credentials to an attacker-controlled server, which is a hallmark of malicious activity such as credential theft or information stealing malware. The code runs this exfiltration immediately upon execution, further indicating malicious intent."
