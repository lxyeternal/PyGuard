      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. Specifically, it hooks into the setuptools install command to run code automatically during package installation without user consent. It scans a specific directory path pattern under /Users/Shared for files matching a cryptographic condition (a 32-byte prefix match with VAR1). Upon finding a match, it triggers CustomRun, which constructs obfuscated URLs by XORing hardcoded byte arrays (VAR2 and VAR3) with dynamically generated keystreams derived from fixed strings and the matched path. It then selects a URL based on the machine architecture and downloads content from this remote URL using requests.get. The downloaded content is XOR-decrypted with another keystream and saved as an executable binary named 'jupyter_calendar' in the user's ~/.local/bin directory. The binary is given executable permissions and launched silently via subprocess.Popen with output suppressed. This sequence effectively downloads and executes a remote payload without user interaction or validation, a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks. The obfuscation of URLs and keys, the automatic execution during install, the writing of executables to user directories, and the silent process spawning all strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code is designed to evade detection by hiding URLs and payloads. Therefore, this code is malicious."
