      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (Base64 encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe', which is highly indicative of a payload delivery or remote code execution attempt. The presence of a directory existence check ('tahg') before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. The use of obfuscation (Base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command and the immediate execution of this command during the setup process (package installation) is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The package metadata also references 'EsqueleSquad' and an email address, which may be attacker-controlled. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute a potentially malicious payload during package installation, which is a strong indicator of malware."
