      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' module and a 'Fernet' class from a 'fernet' package, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent or interaction. The package name 'requiremments' is suspiciously similar to 'requirements' (a common typo-squatting tactic). The use of obfuscated, base64-encoded encrypted data and immediate execution is a classic malware technique to hide payloads and evade detection. The code also imports 'requests' but does not show direct network calls in the snippet, suggesting the decrypted payload may perform further malicious actions such as network communication or data exfiltration. Overall, this is a supply chain attack pattern that hijacks the installation process to run hidden malicious code, which is a critical risk indicator of malware."
