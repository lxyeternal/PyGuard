      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of decoding and decompression (base64 decoding, zlib decompression, marshal loading) to dynamically reconstruct and execute code at runtime via exec. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, as it conceals the true payload and intent from static analysis. The code imports 'marshal', 'zlib', and 'base64' modules in an obfuscated manner and immediately executes the decoded payload without any user interaction or validation. Such behavior is strongly associated with malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution, often used to deliver payloads that can perform unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or further payload downloads. The absence of any legitimate application logic, combined with the use of obfuscation and dynamic execution, confirms that this code contains malicious behavior."
