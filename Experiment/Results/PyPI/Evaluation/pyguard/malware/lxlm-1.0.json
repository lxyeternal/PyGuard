      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, non-official GitHub URL and saves it with a suspicious temporary filename. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using a shell command ('start' on Windows) without any user interaction, consent, or validation. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware, as it fetches and runs potentially untrusted code from an external source during package installation or execution. The use of the 'setup' function from setuptools combined with immediate execution of a downloaded binary during the script run strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector. The code only runs on Windows platforms and silently quits otherwise, which suggests targeted malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the downloaded executable could perform arbitrary harmful actions on the victim system. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
