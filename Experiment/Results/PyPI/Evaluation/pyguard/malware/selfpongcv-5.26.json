      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The PowerShell command runs hidden without user interaction or notification, which is a strong indicator of stealthy malicious behavior. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name 'selfpongcv' with author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raise suspicion. The setup() call appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except that suppresses errors, which may be used to hide failures. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window, conditional execution based on file system state, and lack of user consent or transparency strongly indicates malicious intent."
