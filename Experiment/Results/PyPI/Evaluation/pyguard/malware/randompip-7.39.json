      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for evasion and to execute arbitrary code without user awareness. The base64-encoded command likely contains a PowerShell script that performs unauthorized or harmful actions, although the exact decoded content is not shown here. Additionally, this execution happens automatically during the setup script execution, which is a classic supply chain attack vector where malicious code runs during package installation without user consent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscation and stealth flags is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
