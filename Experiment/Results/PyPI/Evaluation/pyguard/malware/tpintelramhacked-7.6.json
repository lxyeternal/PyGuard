      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip hints at a malicious source). This pattern of obfuscated command execution via PowerShell, hidden process spawning, and lack of legitimate context is a hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise. Additionally, the package setup metadata uses suspicious author and package names, which may be used to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and consistent with known malicious supply chain attack techniques."
