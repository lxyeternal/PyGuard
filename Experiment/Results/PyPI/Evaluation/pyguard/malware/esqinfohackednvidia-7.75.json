      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a suspicious directory check ('tahg') before execution and the use of a hidden PowerShell window strongly indicate stealthy, potentially malicious behavior. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious names such as 'esqinfohackednvidia' and an email address 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which are unusual and may be associated with malicious actors. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup, lack of transparency, and stealth execution is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware delivery mechanisms. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
