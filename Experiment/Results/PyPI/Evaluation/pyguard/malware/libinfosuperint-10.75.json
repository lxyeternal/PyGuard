      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command, the use of subprocess to execute it stealthily, and the check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution) are classic hallmarks of malware. Additionally, the author and email fields reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which are suspicious and possibly attacker-controlled. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious payloads during package installation. The lack of any legitimate business logic or user consent, combined with obfuscated command execution, strongly indicates this code is malicious."
