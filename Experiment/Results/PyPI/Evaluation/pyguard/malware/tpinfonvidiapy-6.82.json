      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded and obfuscated, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting a persistence or staging check. The PowerShell command runs in hidden window mode (WindowStyle Hidden) and uses the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to avoid user detection. The encoded command references a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) and a path that appears to be a download or execution of a file named 'Esquele.exe'. This behavior is consistent with malware that downloads and executes a payload silently. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information ('EsqueleSquad') and an email address that does not correspond to a known legitimate source. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and references to suspicious external resources strongly indicates malicious behavior."
