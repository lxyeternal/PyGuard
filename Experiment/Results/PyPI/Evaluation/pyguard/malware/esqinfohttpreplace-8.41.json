      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing easy inspection of its intent, which is a common malware tactic. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated detection or to stage payloads. The use of subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a non-legitimate source. The setup call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates malicious intent."
