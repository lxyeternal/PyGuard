      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known method to obfuscate and stealthily execute potentially harmful commands without user interaction or notification. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a hallmark of stealthy code execution, often used for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during the setup phase strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
