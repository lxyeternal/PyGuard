      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It decodes a base64-encoded URL that points to a Discord webhook, which is a common attacker-controlled endpoint for data exfiltration. The script searches for Steam installation directories and collects files starting with 'ssfn' and the Steam config directory, which are sensitive files related to Steam user sessions and authentication. It then compresses these files into a zip archive in the TEMP directory without any user consent or notification. Immediately after, it sends this archive via an HTTP POST request to the decoded webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating potentially sensitive user credentials or session data to a remote attacker-controlled server. The use of base64 encoding to hide the webhook URL, the silent collection of sensitive files, and the automated network transmission without user interaction or legitimate business logic are hallmark signs of credential-stealing malware. The code also attempts to delete the created zip file to cover its tracks. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, obfuscation, and unauthorized access to user credentials."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It decodes a base64-encoded URL that points to a Discord webhook, which is a common attacker-controlled endpoint for data exfiltration. The script silently checks for the existence of a directory in the user's AppData Roaming folder named 'Exodus'—likely containing sensitive user data such as wallet or application information. It then copies this directory to a temporary location, compresses it into a zip archive, and sends the archive via an HTTP POST request to the decoded webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. After sending, it attempts to delete the temporary files to cover its tracks. This automated collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive user data to a hardcoded, obfuscated external server, combined with the use of base64 encoding to hide the webhook URL, is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or error handling that would justify this behavior in benign software."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports multiple modules with suspicious and potentially malicious names such as 'metamask', 'discord', 'exodus', 'machine', 'lastweb3toolzbro.passwords_cards_cookies', 'screenshot', and 'telegram'. These names suggest functionality related to credential or token theft (e.g., 'find_tokens', 'yea', 'runner', 'machineinfo'). The code attempts to import a module named 'lastweb3toolzbro.passwords_cards_cookies', which strongly implies collection of sensitive data like passwords, cards, and cookies. The function 'stha' calls these imported functions inside try-except blocks, suppressing errors and continuing execution, which is a common evasion technique. The code immediately spawns a background thread to run 'stha' without any user interaction or notification, indicating stealthy background execution. The use of multiple imports from relative paths with suspicious names, combined with the invocation of functions likely designed to collect sensitive information (e.g., tokens, machine info, screenshots, telegram data), strongly indicates automated data collection and exfiltration. The presence of these behaviors aligns with known malicious patterns such as credential stealing, token harvesting, environment reconnaissance, and stealth execution. Therefore, this code is highly indicative of malicious intent."

It then encodes a hardcoded webhook URL (decoded from base64) and sends the collected tokens via an HTTP POST request to this external webhook without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential theft and data exfiltration. The use of base64 encoding to hide the webhook URL, the targeting of sensitive user data (Discord tokens), and the automated network transmission to an attacker-controlled endpoint are strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with credential-stealing malware."

It decodes a base64-encoded URL that points to a Discord webhook, which is a common exfiltration endpoint used by malware.

It then archives this data into a zip file and sends it via an HTTP POST request to the decoded webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This pattern of collecting sensitive browser extension data and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server is a hallmark of credential-stealing malware. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding of the webhook URL), the targeting of cryptocurrency wallet extension data, and the automated network exfiltration confirm the malicious intent of this code."

The use of base64 encoding to hide the webhook URL is a form of obfuscation commonly used in malware to conceal the destination of exfiltrated data. The code then attempts to delete the screenshot file to cover its tracks. This sequence of automated data collection (screen capture) and silent exfiltration to an attacker-controlled external server without user consent or legitimate purpose is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate user interaction, logging, or error handling that would suggest benign intent."

It enumerates installed browsers by checking known user data paths, then extracts sensitive data such as saved passwords, cookies, credit card information, browsing history, and download history from browser profile databases. It uses Windows API (win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData) and AES decryption to decrypt encrypted passwords and credit card numbers. The collected data is saved into temporary files under the user's AppData Local Temp directory, then compressed into a zip archive. Finally, the archive is exfiltrated via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, base64-obfuscated webhook URL pointing to discord.com, a common attacker-controlled endpoint for receiving stolen data. The entire process is automated, runs without user interaction or consent, and deletes temporary files after exfiltration to cover tracks. The use of base64 encoding to hide the webhook URL, the targeting of sensitive browser data, and the network exfiltration of stolen credentials are hallmark indicators of malicious credential-stealing malware."
