      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a remote URL without any validation or user consent, writes it to a randomly named folder inside the system temporary directory, and immediately executes it as a subprocess. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious behavior because it enables arbitrary code execution from untrusted, remote sources. The absence of any integrity checks, user interaction, or notification before execution, combined with dynamic path construction and execution of downloaded content, matches known malware techniques for payload delivery and execution. Such behavior is rarely, if ever, required in benign software and is a classic hallmark of malware propagation, remote code execution, or backdoor installation."
