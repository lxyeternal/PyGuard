      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to execute hidden, potentially harmful commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands, indicating an attempt to hide the true intent of the command. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this hidden PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raises suspicion. Additionally, the setup call uses a suspicious package name 'py-hackednvidiarand' and author name 'EsqueleSquad', which do not correspond to known legitimate packages. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script, hidden execution flags, and suspicious naming strongly indicates malicious intent, likely for stealthy execution of a payload or further compromise during package installation."
