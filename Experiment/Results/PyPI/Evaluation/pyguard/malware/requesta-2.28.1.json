      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a list of executable filenames from a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt) and filters them based on the current operating system. It then downloads each executable file from the same external server, writes it to the local working directory, sets executable permissions on Unix-like systems, and immediately executes these files in the background without any user interaction or consent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious activity: automatic retrieval and execution of potentially untrusted binaries from a remote source, writing executables to the current directory without validation, and silent background execution. The use of a hardcoded IP address rather than a legitimate domain, lack of any integrity checks or user notification, and immediate execution of downloaded files strongly indicate this code is designed for malicious payload delivery and execution, consistent with malware propagation or remote code execution attacks."
