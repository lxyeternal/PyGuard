      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The package name 'requiiremnts' is suspicious and resembles a typo-squatted package name, which is common in malicious PyPI packages. The use of obfuscated, encrypted code executed during installation, combined with network-related imports (requests) and no legitimate business logic, strongly indicates that the package is designed to execute hidden malicious payloads on the victim's system during installation. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as code obfuscation, execution of decrypted code, execution during package installation, and use of suspicious package naming."
