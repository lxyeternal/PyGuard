      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a list of executable filenames from a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt) and filters them based on the current operating system. It then downloads each executable file from the same external server, writes it to the current working directory, sets executable permissions if on Linux or macOS, and immediately executes these files in the background without any user interaction or consent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: automated download and execution of potentially untrusted binaries from a hardcoded external source, lack of user notification or validation, writing executables to the current directory, and spawning processes silently. Such a pattern is a strong hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential system compromise. The code also hooks into all HTTP method functions to trigger this execution automatically, indicating an attempt to run malicious payloads whenever network requests are made. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
