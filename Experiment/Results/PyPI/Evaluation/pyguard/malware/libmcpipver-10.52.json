      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed during the package setup phase (or at import time) is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading and executing further payloads. The directory existence check for 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The use of an encoded PowerShell command string to hide intent and the execution of this command in a background process without user consent or transparency strongly indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks to execute malicious code during installation."
