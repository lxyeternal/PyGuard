      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential-stealing malware targeting Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and other sensitive user data. It collects Discord tokens from various local storage paths of browsers and Discord clients, decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI, and extracts user information such as email, phone, badges, billing info, and friends list via Discord API calls. The malware then exfiltrates this stolen data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. It also collects and uploads files from user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) that match sensitive keywords, zips wallet, gaming, and other application data, and uploads these archives to anonymous file hosting services. The code ensures persistence by copying itself to the Windows startup folder. It uses obfuscated function and variable names, multiple threads for stealth and evasion, and suppresses errors to avoid detection. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URLs, automated data collection and exfiltration without user consent, environment variable usage to locate sensitive directories, and cryptographic decryption of stored credentials are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This code exhibits classic behaviors of information-stealing malware designed to silently harvest and transmit sensitive user credentials and system information to an attacker-controlled server."
