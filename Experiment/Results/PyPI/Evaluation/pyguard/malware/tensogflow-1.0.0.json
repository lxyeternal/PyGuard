      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a base64-encoded payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The package name 'tensogflow' is a typo-squatted variant of the legitimate 'tensorflow' package, which is a common tactic used by attackers to trick users into installing malicious packages. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description strings further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The use of the 'fernet' module to decrypt an embedded payload and execute it dynamically during installation strongly suggests that the package is designed to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine. This behavior aligns with known supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation to compromise the system. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
