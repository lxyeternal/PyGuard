      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (Base64 encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (cdnd.discordapp.com/attachments/...), which is a known vector for malware delivery. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script but silently triggers this hidden payload execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
