      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the standard setuptools install command. Inside the run() method, it contains a large obfuscated string and a numeric key string. It performs a character-wise XOR decryption of the obfuscated string using the numeric key, resulting in dynamically generated Python code. This decrypted code is then executed immediately using eval(compile(...)). This pattern of obfuscation combined with dynamic code execution during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it allows execution of hidden arbitrary code on the user's system without consent or transparency. The use of obfuscation and eval in a setup install hook is a known supply chain attack technique to execute malware during package installation. The code suppresses any exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for such obfuscated dynamic code execution in a package setup script, and this behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, execution of hidden payloads during install, and lack of user interaction or notification."
