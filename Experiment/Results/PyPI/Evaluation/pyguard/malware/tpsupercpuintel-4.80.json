      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The encoded command references a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and downloads or executes a payload from a remote source, which is a hallmark of malware. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with spawning a hidden PowerShell process strongly indicates stealthy, unauthorized code execution. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious author information and package naming that does not correspond to legitimate software, further supporting the malicious intent. The try/except blocks suppress errors, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including obfuscated remote code execution during package setup, stealth execution, and potential payload delivery."
