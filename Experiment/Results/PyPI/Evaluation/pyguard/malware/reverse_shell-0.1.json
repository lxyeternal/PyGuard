      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell that connects to a remote server (localhost on port 4444) and waits for commands to execute. It uses socket to establish a TCP connection and subprocess.Popen with shell=True to execute arbitrary shell commands received from the remote server. The output (both stdout and stderr) of these commands is sent back to the server. This pattern is a classic hallmark of remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors, enabling an attacker to gain remote command execution capabilities on the victim system. There is no user interaction or consent, no validation or sanitization of commands, and the code runs immediately upon execution, all of which are strong indicators of malicious intent."
