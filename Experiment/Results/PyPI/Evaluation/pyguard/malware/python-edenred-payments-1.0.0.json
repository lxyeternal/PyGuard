      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (\"https://cdf5rwk2vtc0000c78d0ggz1hqeyyyyyb.oast.fun\"). This behavior occurs automatically during installation without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages. The collection and exfiltration of system and user information to an attacker-controlled server during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification associated with this data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code exhibits critical risk malicious behavior consistent with credential or environment data theft and supply chain compromise."
