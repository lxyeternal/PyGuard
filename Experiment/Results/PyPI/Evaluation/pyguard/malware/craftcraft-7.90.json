      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a known stealth technique. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup or install time is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as legitimate packages rarely execute hidden shell commands with encoded payloads during installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution is a classic supply chain attack pattern to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy payload execution and potential further compromise."
