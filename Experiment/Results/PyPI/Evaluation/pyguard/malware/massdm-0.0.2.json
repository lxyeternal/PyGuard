      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It imports numerous modules commonly used in malware, including pyperclip (clipboard access), threading, requests, and httpx (network communication). The code contains a large obfuscated payload that is decompressed and executed dynamically using marshal.loads and gzip.decompress, which is a classic technique for hiding malicious payloads and evading static analysis. The presence of exec on decompressed data is a critical risk indicator of arbitrary code execution. The code also imports win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData, which is often used to decrypt Windows credentials or sensitive data. The obfuscated payload likely contains further malicious logic such as credential theft, environment reconnaissance, or remote code execution. The code suppresses exceptions and runs without user interaction, indicating stealthy operation. The extensive obfuscation, dynamic execution, and use of sensitive APIs strongly suggest this is malware designed for information stealing, persistence, or remote control. Therefore, this code should be treated as malicious."
