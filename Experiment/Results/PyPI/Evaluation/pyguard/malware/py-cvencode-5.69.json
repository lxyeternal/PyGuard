      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a stealth technique to avoid repeated execution. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known method for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads, often used in malware for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further malicious payloads. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution during import or setup is a classic supply chain attack pattern. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup, all of which are strongly associated with malware."
