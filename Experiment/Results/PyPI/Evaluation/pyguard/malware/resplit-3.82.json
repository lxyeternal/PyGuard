      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating a stealth or persistence mechanism. This behavior is strongly indicative of malicious intent, as it involves obfuscated code execution, stealth execution of a hidden shell, and no legitimate reason for such execution during a package setup. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during the setup phase is a hallmark of a supply chain attack or malware embedded in a package installation script."
