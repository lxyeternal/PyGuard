      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a known stealth technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The setup() call appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except block and does not mitigate the malicious subprocess spawn. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script, hidden execution, conditional directory existence check, and lack of user interaction or notification are strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware installation routines."
