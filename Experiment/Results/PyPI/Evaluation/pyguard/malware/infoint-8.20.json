      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a typical stealth behavior. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute obfuscated PowerShell commands in a hidden manner during package setup is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware that executes payloads during installation. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered automatically on import or installation is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."
