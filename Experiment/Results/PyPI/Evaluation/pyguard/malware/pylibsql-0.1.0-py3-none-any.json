      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It collects extensive sensitive user data including system information (username, computer name, Windows key, hardware ID, IP address, geolocation), browser data (passwords, cookies, history, credit card info), Discord tokens, Minecraft and Roblox data, and clipboard contents. It decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows APIs and AES decryption, indicating intent to extract protected credentials. The code exfiltrates this data to attacker-controlled URLs (e.g., https://realbatman.com/ and other hardcoded webhook URLs) via HTTP POST requests without user consent or notification. It also attempts to replace cryptocurrency wallet addresses in the clipboard to hijack transactions. The code uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding, regex matching, and random file name generation to evade detection. It employs anti-analysis checks to avoid running in virtual machines or known analysis environments. It installs itself persistently by copying to the Windows startup folder and kills Discord-related processes to evade detection. The code runs multiple threads to perform background data collection and exfiltration continuously. It downloads and executes additional code from remote sources, further indicating a multi-stage attack. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URLs, extensive credential theft, clipboard hijacking, environment reconnaissance, and stealth techniques confirm this is a malicious information stealer designed to compromise user privacy and security."
