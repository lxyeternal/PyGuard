      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and other sensitive user data. It collects environment information such as IP address and username, then extracts Discord tokens from various local application data paths (including browsers and Discord clients). It decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption, collects billing and friend information from Discord APIs using stolen tokens, and compiles this data into formatted messages. The code then exfiltrates this sensitive information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without user consent. It also searches user directories for files with keywords related to accounts and secrets, uploads these files to anonymous file hosting services, and reports the findings. The code uses threading to perform these actions concurrently and attempts to kill processes to access locked files. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URLs, automated extraction and decryption of sensitive credentials, silent network exfiltration, and no user interaction or notification are strong indicators of malicious intent. This code matches multiple known malware patterns such as credential theft, data exfiltration, and stealthy background execution."
