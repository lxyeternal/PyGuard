      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed during the setup script execution is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading and executing further payloads. The directory existence check for 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The use of a suspicious author name and email (EsqueleSquad, tahgoficial@proton.me) and a suspicious comment with a non-standard URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports malicious intent. The setup call itself appears to be a cover for executing this hidden payload. These factors combined align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during package installation."
