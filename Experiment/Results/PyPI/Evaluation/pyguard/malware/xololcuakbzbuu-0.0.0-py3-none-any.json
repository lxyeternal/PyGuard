      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and dynamic execution via exec. It decodes a large base64-encoded string and immediately executes it, which is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The obfuscation prevents straightforward analysis and is commonly used to hide malicious payloads. The code uses multiple chained string replacements on the decoded data, indicating attempts to evade detection. The immediate execution of decoded data without any validation or user interaction strongly suggests it is executing hidden, potentially harmful code. Such patterns are typical in malware for payload delivery, code injection, or remote code execution. Given the extensive obfuscation, dynamic execution, and lack of benign context, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
