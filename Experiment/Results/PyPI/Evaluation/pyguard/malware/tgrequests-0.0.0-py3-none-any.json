      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and other sensitive user data. It collects environment information such as IP address and username, decrypts stored browser data (using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption), and extracts Discord tokens from various local storage paths. The code then exfiltrates this stolen data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without user consent. It also searches user directories for files with keywords related to passwords, accounts, and secrets, uploads these files to anonymous file hosting services, and sends links to the attacker. The code uses threading to perform these actions concurrently and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. It kills certain processes to access locked files, copies browser databases to temporary locations for reading, and uses obfuscated variable names and base64 decoding for decryption. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook, automated extraction of sensitive credentials, environment reconnaissance, and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints are definitive indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
