      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip and the encoded command referencing a suspicious domain 'cdn.discordapp.com'). This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution during package installation. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute potentially harmful commands on the host system during package installation, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
