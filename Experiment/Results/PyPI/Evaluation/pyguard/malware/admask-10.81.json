      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The base64-encoded command is not decoded or inspected in the code, but the pattern of launching a hidden PowerShell with encoded commands is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means the malicious payload executes automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a decoy or to mask the malicious behavior. The try-except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."
