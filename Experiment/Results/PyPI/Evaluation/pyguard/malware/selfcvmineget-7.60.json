      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to a suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com) to download or execute further payloads, which is a classic pattern of malware downloading and executing remote code. Additionally, the setup() call with suspicious package name 'selfcvmineget' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appears to be a cover for the malicious payload execution during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with spawning a hidden PowerShell process and contacting an external URL without user consent is a hallmark of malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
