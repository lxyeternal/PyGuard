      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the flag '-WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW', which suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely contains obfuscated instructions, which is a typical malware tactic to evade detection. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which may be used as a persistence or evasion mechanism. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup call for a package with a suspicious name 'tppywed' and author 'EsqueleSquad', which may be a typosquatted or malicious package. The execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
