      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a typical evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands strongly suggest that the code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful payloads during package installation or execution. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask the malicious payload execution. This pattern aligns with known supply chain attacks and malware that execute code during Python package installation, leveraging obfuscation and hidden process execution to evade detection."
