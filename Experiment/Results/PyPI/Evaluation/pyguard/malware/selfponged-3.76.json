      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and uses the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible console window, a typical stealth technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. This pattern of executing obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup is a known supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and potential further payload delivery without user consent or interaction. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
