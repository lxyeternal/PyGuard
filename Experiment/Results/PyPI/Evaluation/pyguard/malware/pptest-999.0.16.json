      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install_scripts command class that, during installation, collects detailed environment information including the hostname, current working directory, local IP addresses, and public WAN IP address by querying external services. It then encodes this information into DNS query payloads sent to a hardcoded suspicious domain 'hte1ck6lvk1ktcuxl0x8jfgeu50vok.burpcollaborator.net' via DNS A record lookups using a specified DNS server (8.8.8.8). This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and network information without user consent or notification. The exfiltration via DNS queries to an attacker-controlled domain is a known covert channel technique used by malware to evade detection. Additionally, the code hooks into the package installation process (setup.py) to execute this data collection and exfiltration automatically when the package is installed, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The presence of hardcoded suspicious domains, network communication during install, and covert data exfiltration patterns strongly indicate malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system and network information including hostname, current working directory, local IP addresses, and public WAN IP address without any user interaction or consent. It then encodes this information into a hex string and sends it via DNS queries to a suspicious hardcoded domain 'hte1ck6lvk1ktcuxl0x8jfgeu50vok.burpcollaborator.net', which is a known attacker-controlled domain used for out-of-band interaction and data exfiltration. This behavior is a classic form of covert data exfiltration using DNS tunneling, a common technique in malware to stealthily leak sensitive environment information. The code also suppresses user notification and performs network communication automatically. These characteristics align strongly with malicious activity, specifically information stealing and covert exfiltration to a command-and-control server."
