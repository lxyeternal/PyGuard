      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally based on the absence of a directory named 'tahg' suggests stealthy, potentially unauthorized activity. Such use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands in hidden mode is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads, which is a hallmark of malware. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, enabling execution of malicious code during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the subprocess call with the encoded PowerShell command is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
