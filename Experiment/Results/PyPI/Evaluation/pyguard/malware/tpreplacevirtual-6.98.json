      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and may be linked to malicious actors. The setup() call appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except pass block, which suppresses errors and may be used to hide malicious activity during package installation. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script, hidden process creation, and lack of user interaction or notification strongly indicate malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware payload delivery."
