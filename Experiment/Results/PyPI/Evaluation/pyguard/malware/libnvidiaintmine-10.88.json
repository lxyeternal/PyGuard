      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed during the setup script is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as this pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads from a suspicious URL (not directly visible but indicated by the comment and encoded command). The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during package setup strongly suggests this is a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism embedded in a Python package installation script."
