      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. This pattern of decrypting and immediately executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The code executes arbitrary, obfuscated code without user consent or interaction, which can lead to remote code execution, payload delivery, or other harmful actions. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution (exec), and execution triggered automatically during installation strongly indicates malicious intent."
