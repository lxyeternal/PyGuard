      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (cdnd.discordapp.com) and downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' in a hidden manner. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to download and execute a payload without user consent or notification. Additionally, the package metadata references 'EsqueleSquad' and an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which may be associated with malicious actors. The presence of this code in a setup script suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) and hidden execution, combined with network activity targeting a suspicious domain, confirms the code is malicious."
