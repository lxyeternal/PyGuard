      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during package installation strongly indicate an attempt to run hidden malicious code on the victim's system during package installation. The package name 'web3.p6' and the meaningless description strings further suggest obfuscation and malicious intent. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
