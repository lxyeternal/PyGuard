      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a base64-encoded, encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, often used in supply chain attacks to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation. The package name 'requiements' is suspiciously similar to 'requirements' (a common typoquatting tactic). The obfuscated class name and meaningless description strings further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The use of 'exec' on decrypted data, combined with network-related imports and execution during installation, strongly indicates that this code is designed to execute hidden malicious payloads on Windows systems during package installation."
