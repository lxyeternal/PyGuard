      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a CustomInstallCommand class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute obfuscated code during package installation. Specifically, it defines a large obfuscated string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' and a numeric key string 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp', then performs a character-wise XOR deobfuscation to reconstruct a Python code string. This reconstructed code is then executed dynamically using eval(compile(...)). Executing dynamically decoded code during installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The obfuscation and immediate execution of hidden code without user consent or transparency is a hallmark of malware. The rest of the setup script appears normal, but the presence of this obfuscated, dynamically executed payload in the install hook is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."
