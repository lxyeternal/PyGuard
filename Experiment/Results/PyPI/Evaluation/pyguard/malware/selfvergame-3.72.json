      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup or import is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading and executing further payloads. Additionally, the author and email fields, as well as the commented URL (www.esquelesquad.rip), suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of distutils setup alongside this hidden execution further indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation or setup. Therefore, this code is malicious."
