      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This obfuscation technique (base64-encoded PowerShell command) is a classic hallmark of malware attempting to hide its true intent. The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), which is typical for stealthy execution. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a suspicious package name ('selfgetintelgame') further raise suspicion. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy subprocess spawning, and lack of legitimate user interaction or business logic strongly indicates malicious intent."
