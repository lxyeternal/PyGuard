      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and may be linked to malicious actors. The use of subprocess to launch obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup or import is a known supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscated commands strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the code suppresses exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and potential supply chain attack during package installation."
