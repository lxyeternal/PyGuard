      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated runs. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'Windo​wsCache.exe' from that URL, which is a strong indicator of malicious payload delivery. Additionally, the package metadata uses suspicious author information and a suspicious package name, which may be an attempt to disguise the malicious code as a legitimate package. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process creation, and remote payload download is a hallmark of malware, specifically a supply chain or installation-time attack vector. Therefore, this code is malicious."
