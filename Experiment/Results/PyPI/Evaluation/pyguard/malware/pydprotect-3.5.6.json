      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a heavily obfuscated Python script to a file named 'mal.pyw' in the user's APPDATA directory and immediately executes it using startfile. The embedded script is encoded with multiple layers of obfuscation, including hex-encoded strings, lambda functions with meaningless variable names, and a large compressed binary blob that is decompressed and executed via eval. This pattern of writing obfuscated code to a hidden location and executing it without user interaction is a classic hallmark of malware. The use of environment variables to target APPDATA, the obfuscation techniques, and the immediate execution of the hidden payload strongly indicate malicious intent, likely for persistence, payload delivery, or data exfiltration. There is no legitimate or benign reason for such behavior in typical Python applications."
