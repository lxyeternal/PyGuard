      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that executes automatically during package installation. It performs multiple suspicious actions without user consent or notification: it creates directories in the Windows user's Startup folder and another folder named 'Powerpoint' under the Start Menu Programs directory, which are unusual and sensitive locations typically used for persistence. It then clones two GitHub repositories into these directories, one of which appears to contain an executable ('main.exe'). The script moves a Python script ('test.py') from a cloned repository into the Startup folder and immediately launches the executable from the 'Powerpoint' folder. This sequence effectively installs and runs potentially untrusted code on the user's system at install time, enabling persistence by placing scripts in the Startup folder and executing binaries without user interaction. Such behavior is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware that hijacks the installation process to deploy and execute malicious payloads. The use of hardcoded paths in user-specific system directories, cloning from external repositories, and immediate execution of binaries during installation strongly indicate malicious intent."
