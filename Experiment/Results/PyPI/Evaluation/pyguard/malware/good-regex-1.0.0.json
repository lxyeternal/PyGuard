      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (\"fo7288ar9hjgo6tp8p6c1efxpovgja7z.oastify.com\"), which is likely attacker-controlled. This behavior is a classic example of automated data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or consent, combined with the collection and silent transmission of user and system data to an external server, strongly indicates malicious intent."
