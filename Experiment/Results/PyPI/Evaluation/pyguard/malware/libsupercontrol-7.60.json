      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, which is typical for stealthy execution. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution during import or setup is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code runs during package installation or import. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell command execution, stealth execution with hidden window, conditional execution based on file system state, and execution during package setup. There is no legitimate reason for this code to execute a hidden PowerShell command during setup, and the obfuscation strongly suggests malicious intent such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise."
