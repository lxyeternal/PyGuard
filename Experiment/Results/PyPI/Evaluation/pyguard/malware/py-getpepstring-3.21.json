      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the encoded PowerShell command executed in hidden mode is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, often used for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading and executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the true nature of the command, combined with execution during the setup process, strongly suggests a supply chain attack vector. The package metadata references suspicious author information and a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip), which further raises suspicion. Overall, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
