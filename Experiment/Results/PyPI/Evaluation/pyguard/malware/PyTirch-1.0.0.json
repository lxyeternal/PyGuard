      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation without user consent or interaction. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description strings further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The use of 'exec' on decrypted data, combined with network-related imports (requests) and execution during the install hook, strongly suggests this is a supply chain attack vector designed to run hidden malicious code on Windows systems. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a standard setup script, and the code matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and execution of decrypted payloads during package installation."
