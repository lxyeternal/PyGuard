      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://nagogy-cdn.dreamyoak.repl.co/cdn/MEYeniKS.exe) without any user interaction or validation, writes it to the current working directory as 'windows.exe', and immediately executes it using subprocess.run. This pattern—automatic retrieval and execution of a remote binary without user consent or integrity checks—is a strong and well-known indicator of malicious behavior. The absence of any benign context, user notification, or security measures, combined with the use of a non-standard domain and direct execution of an untrusted executable, aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including payload delivery, remote code execution, and potential system compromise."
