      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of an obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell command executed silently is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. This behavior is highly indicative of malicious activity. Additionally, this execution occurs during the import/setup phase, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious intent."
