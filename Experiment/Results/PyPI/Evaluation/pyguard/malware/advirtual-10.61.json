      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to avoid repeated execution or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, which is a stealth technique. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup or installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as legitimate packages rarely execute hidden encoded PowerShell commands without user interaction or notification. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the hidden PowerShell execution alongside it strongly suggests this is a supply chain attack or malicious package designed to execute unauthorized code on installation."
