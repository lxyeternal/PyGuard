      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to execute hidden, potentially malicious PowerShell commands without user interaction or notification. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation and stealth execution. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raises suspicion. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload is triggered during import or execution of this script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in hidden mode, conditional execution based on directory existence, and lack of user consent or transparency strongly indicates malicious behavior."
