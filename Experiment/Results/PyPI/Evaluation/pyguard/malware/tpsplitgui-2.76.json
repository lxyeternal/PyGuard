      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a typical evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands strongly suggest that the code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful payloads during package setup or installation. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. This pattern matches known supply chain attacks and malware that execute code during package installation to compromise the system."
