      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which hides the window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'Windo​wsCache.exe' from that URL. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and runs a payload without user consent or notification. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the payload, which may be used to avoid repeated execution or detection. The presence of this obfuscated, hidden execution during the setup process (package installation) is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The rest of the setup code appears to be a decoy or to mask the malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
