      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, package name, and current working directory, then encodes this data in base64 and further hex-encodes it. It constructs domain names by appending this encoded data to a suspicious DNS domain ('.sub.deliverycontent.online') and performs multiple 'ping' shell commands to these dynamically generated domains, which is a covert channel for data exfiltration. Additionally, it sends HTTP POST and GET requests with the encoded data to a hardcoded suspicious HTTP domain ('www.deliverycontent.online') using multiple methods (urllib.request, requests, urllib), all without any user interaction or notification. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding and hex encoding), the collection and silent exfiltration of environment and user information, the execution of shell commands with dynamically constructed suspicious domains, and the communication with hardcoded external servers are all strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware or a supply chain attack. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent, and the pattern matches known malware behaviors for environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration."
