      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence mechanism. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to run an obfuscated PowerShell command is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it is commonly used to execute hidden payloads, download or execute further malicious code, or perform system compromise actions. Additionally, the package metadata references 'EsqueleSquad' and an email address, which may be a known malicious actor or group. The rest of the code is a typical setup call, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution during import or setup is a classic supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code is malicious."
