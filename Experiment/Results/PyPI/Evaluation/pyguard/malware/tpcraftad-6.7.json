      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized or harmful actions, as suggested by the suspicious domain 'www.esquelesquad.rip' in the comment and the obfuscation of the command. This pattern—obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup—is a well-known hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or payload delivery. The presence of this behavior in a setup script, which runs during package installation, further indicates a supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload. Therefore, this code is malicious."
