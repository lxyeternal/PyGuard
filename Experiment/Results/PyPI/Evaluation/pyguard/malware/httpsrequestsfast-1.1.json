      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module named 'httpsrequests', which is not a standard Python library and appears to be a suspicious or typosquatted package name (likely mimicking 'requests' or 'httprequests'). The import statement alone suggests an attempt to load a potentially malicious or unauthorized module. Given the context of typical malicious code characteristics, the presence of a suspiciously named module import without any further legitimate context is a strong indicator of malicious intent or preparation for malicious activity."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily collect Discord authentication tokens from various local storage paths associated with Discord and multiple Chromium-based browsers. It scans LevelDB files for token patterns, validates these tokens by making authenticated requests to Discord's API, and then gathers sensitive user information such as email, phone number, and billing/payment methods linked to these tokens. The collected data is then encoded and exfiltrated via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is base64-encoded to obfuscate its destination. This entire process occurs without any user interaction or consent, indicating covert data theft. The use of environment variables to locate sensitive directories, the targeting of multiple Discord client variants and browsers, the extraction of authentication tokens, and the exfiltration of personal and payment information to an attacker-controlled webhook are all hallmark behaviors of credential-stealing malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious intent focused on unauthorized data collection and exfiltration."
