      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking a web request to a suspicious domain (as indicated by the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip) or executing further payloads. This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a hidden window is a well-known technique used by malware for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or payload delivery. Additionally, the package name 'esqvirtualvisaosint' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and potentially linked to malicious activity. The setup call is wrapped in a try/except that suppresses errors, which is common in malware to avoid detection. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious intent, including obfuscation, hidden execution, and potential remote code execution during package installation."
