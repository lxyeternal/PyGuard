      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The package name 'BeaotifulSoup' is a typo-squatted variant of the legitimate 'BeautifulSoup' package, which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The use of 'exec' on decrypted data, combined with network-related imports and execution during installation, strongly suggests that the package downloads or contains a hidden malicious payload that will run on the victim's machine during installation. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, remote code execution during package installation, and lack of user consent or notification."
