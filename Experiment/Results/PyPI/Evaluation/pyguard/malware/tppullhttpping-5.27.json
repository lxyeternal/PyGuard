      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (Base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (cdnd.discordapp.com/attachments/...), which is a known vector for malware delivery. The use of obfuscation (Base64 encoding) to hide the PowerShell command, combined with execution during the setup process, is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The package name 'tppullhttpping' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appear suspicious and may be typosquatted or attacker-controlled. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands that fetch and run potentially malicious payloads, indicating malicious intent."
