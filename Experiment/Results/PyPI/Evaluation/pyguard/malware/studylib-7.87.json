      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for evasion and to execute arbitrary or malicious payloads without user awareness. The base64-encoded command likely contains a PowerShell script that performs unauthorized actions, such as downloading or executing further malicious code, persistence, or system compromise. Additionally, this execution occurs during the import/setup phase without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscated payload strongly indicates malicious intent."
