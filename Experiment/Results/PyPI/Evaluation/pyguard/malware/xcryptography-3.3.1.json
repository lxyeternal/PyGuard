      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and a suspicious package name, then encodes this data in base64 and further hex-encodes it. It constructs domain names by appending this encoded data to a suspicious DNS domain ('.sub.deliverycontent.online') and performs multiple 'ping' shell commands to these dynamically generated domains, which is an unusual and suspicious behavior. Additionally, it sends HTTP POST and GET requests with the encoded data to hardcoded, suspicious external domains ('www.deliverycontent.online'). The entire process is automated, runs without user interaction or consent, and uses obfuscation techniques (base64 encoding and hex encoding) to hide the data being exfiltrated. These behaviors are classic indicators of data exfiltration malware or information-stealing code, as it silently collects environment and user information and sends it to attacker-controlled servers. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the use of shell commands combined with network exfiltration strongly indicates malicious intent."
