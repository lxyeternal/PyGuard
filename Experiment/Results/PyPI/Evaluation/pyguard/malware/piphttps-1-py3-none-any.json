      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a clear example of malicious behavior, specifically a Discord token stealer and data exfiltration malware. It performs the following malicious actions: 1) It accesses sensitive user data by reading Discord and various Chromium-based browser local storage files to extract encrypted Discord tokens. 2) It decrypts these tokens using Windows CryptUnprotectData API and AES decryption, indicating it targets Windows user credentials. 3) It uses these tokens to query Discord's API for user account information, including email, phone, 2FA status, Nitro subscription, and user ID. 4) It collects system information such as IP address, PC username, and PC name. 5) It exfiltrates all this sensitive information (tokens, user data, system info) to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, enabling the attacker to receive stolen credentials and system details remotely. 6) The code runs automatically without user interaction, silently collecting and sending data. 7) It uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding and encrypted keys to hide token extraction and decryption. 8) The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and automated network requests to attacker-controlled endpoints confirms intent to steal and leak sensitive data. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including credential theft, data exfiltration, environment reconnaissance, and use of obfuscation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
