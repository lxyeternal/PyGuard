      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a hidden PowerShell window executing a base64-encoded command. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or consent, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting a stealth or persistence mechanism. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide the window, combined with base64 encoding of the PowerShell command, is a classic malware technique to evade detection and execute arbitrary code silently. Additionally, the package metadata references 'EsqueleSquad' and a suspicious email, which aligns with known malicious actors. The setup call is wrapped in a try/except block, likely to suppress errors and avoid raising suspicion. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup/install is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior."
