      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated command string. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware that executes code during package installation without user consent or notification. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup, which is a common tactic to evade detection. Therefore, this code is malicious."
