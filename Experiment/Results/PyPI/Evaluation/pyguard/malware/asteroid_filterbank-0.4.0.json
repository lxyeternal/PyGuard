      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'new_install' that registers a function '_post_install' to be executed at exit during the package installation process. The '_post_install' function performs several suspicious actions without user consent: it writes a file named 'bykotko.txt' with the content 'kotko' in the current directory, then collects system information including the public IP address (via a request to 'https://api.ipify.org'), the hostname (via os.uname()[1]), and the absolute path of the current file's directory (URL-encoded). It concatenates this information, encodes it in base64, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL 'https://kotko.org' with query parameters constructed from hardcoded strings and the encoded data. This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and network information during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious code. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the transmitted data, the lack of any legitimate user interaction or notification, and the execution of this code during installation (a trusted context) further confirm the malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for this code to collect and send such information to an external server during installation, making this a clear case of malicious behavior."
