      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It contains heavy obfuscation, including the use of exec on dynamically constructed and compressed code blocks, which is a classic technique to hide malicious payloads. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, and executes code during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. There are large embedded binary blobs passed to functions named 'Power' and 'Ceil' that appear to decompress and execute data, indicating payload delivery and execution. The code also uses dynamic eval and compile calls on obfuscated strings, further confirming code injection and execution. The presence of suspicious URLs, Discord invite links, and GitHub repositories with names like 'Hyperion' and authors with suspicious handles suggest malicious intent. The code attempts to execute arbitrary code during installation without user consent or interaction, a hallmark of malware. Overall, the combination of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, embedded binary payloads, and execution during setup strongly indicates this code is malicious."
