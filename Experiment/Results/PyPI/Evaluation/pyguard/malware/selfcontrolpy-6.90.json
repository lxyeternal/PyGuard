      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command. The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during the package setup phase, combined with the suspicious author email and package name, strongly suggests this is a supply chain attack or malware attempting to execute unauthorized code on the host system without user consent or interaction. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation, all of which are hallmark behaviors of malicious code."
