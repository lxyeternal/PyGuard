      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses subprocess.Popen to spawn new Python processes that import a module named 'secrevtwo' and its submodule 'dist_util' in a try-except fallback manner. This behavior is suspicious because it attempts to execute code from an external or additional package during the setup/install phase without user interaction or explicit consent. The package name 'secrevtwo' appears to be a typo or a suspicious name, which is a common characteristic of typosquatted or malicious packages. The subprocess calls execute Python code dynamically, which can be used to run arbitrary or malicious code during installation. Additionally, the setup script declares a dependency on 'secrevtwo', which may be a malicious package that could execute harmful payloads. Executing subprocesses during package installation to import and run code from an external package is a known vector for supply chain attacks and remote code execution. There is no legitimate reason for this pattern in a benign setup script, and it aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including code execution during installation, use of suspicious package names, and spawning subprocesses to run potentially untrusted code."
