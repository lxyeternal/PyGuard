      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (Base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or performing system modifications. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name 'libpipnvidia' which mimics legitimate package naming conventions to evade detection. The combination of obfuscated command execution during package setup/install and the use of hidden PowerShell processes is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
