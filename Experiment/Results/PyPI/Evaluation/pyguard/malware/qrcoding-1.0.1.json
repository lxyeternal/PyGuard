      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, during installation, downloads a Python script from a remote URL (https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py) without any validation or user consent, writes it to the local directory, and immediately executes it using subprocess. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling arbitrary remote code execution on the user's system during package installation. The downloaded script is fetched from an untrusted, non-official source (transfer.sh), which is commonly used for temporary file hosting and can be controlled by an attacker. There is no integrity check, no user notification, and no legitimate reason for executing external code at install time. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and is a critical risk indicator for malicious behavior."
