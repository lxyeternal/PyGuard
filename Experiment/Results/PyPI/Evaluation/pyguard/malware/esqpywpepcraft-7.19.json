      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only then executes the PowerShell command, which is a common evasion technique. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to a suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com) to download or execute further payloads. This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a setup script is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware that execute arbitrary code during package installation. The presence of a suspicious author email and package name further supports the malicious intent. The use of try/except to silently suppress errors also indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute a remote payload during installation, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity."
