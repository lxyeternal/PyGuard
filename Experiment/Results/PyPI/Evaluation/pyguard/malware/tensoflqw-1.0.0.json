      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' module and the 'Fernet' class from the 'fernet' package, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This behavior is a classic hallmark of malicious code: executing obfuscated, encrypted code during package installation without user interaction or consent. The package name 'tensoflqw' and author details appear random and suspicious, indicating possible typosquatting or obfuscation. The encrypted payload is not visible in plaintext, preventing static analysis of its contents, but the use of Fernet decryption followed by exec() strongly indicates execution of hidden malicious payload. The code runs this payload automatically during installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of network-related imports (requests) inside the install hook suggests potential network communication, possibly for downloading further payloads or exfiltrating data. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated payload execution during install, use of encryption to hide payload, execution without user consent, suspicious package metadata, and conditional execution only on Windows systems, all consistent with malicious behavior."
