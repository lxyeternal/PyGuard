      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window, CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag), which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The use of distutils setup appears to be a cover or a delivery mechanism, but the key malicious action is the hidden execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during import or installation. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated base64-encoded shell commands, hidden process execution, lack of user interaction or notification, and execution triggered during package setup, all of which are hallmark signs of malware or supply chain attacks."
