      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The package name 'requirementstxtx' and obfuscated variable names further suggest evasion attempts. The decrypted code is not visible in the source, indicating obfuscation and dynamic code execution, which is commonly used to hide malicious payloads. The use of network-related modules (requests) inside the install hook suggests potential network communication, possibly for downloading additional payloads or exfiltrating data. Executing decrypted code during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution on the victim's machine. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
