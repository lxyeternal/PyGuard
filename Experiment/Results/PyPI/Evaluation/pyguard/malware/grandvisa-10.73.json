      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an -EncodedCommand argument. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell command string, which is a well-known obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates an attempt to run the command stealthily without user notification or visible windows. This pattern—executing an obfuscated PowerShell command in hidden mode during package setup—is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading and executing further payloads. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during installation strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery. Therefore, this code is malicious."
