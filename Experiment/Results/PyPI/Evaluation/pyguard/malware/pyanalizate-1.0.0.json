      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and compression (base64, zlib) combined with dynamic execution functions such as eval and exec. It constructs and executes code dynamically from compressed and encoded data, which is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The code uses obfuscated variable names and lambda functions to hide its intent. The presence of eval on decompressed and decoded data, without any validation or user interaction, strongly indicates that it executes hidden payloads. Such patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are used to evade detection, deliver payloads, or perform unauthorized actions. The code also references suspicious strings and uses indirect execution of code, which is typical for malware attempting to conceal its true purpose. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
