      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware. It systematically searches for and accesses sensitive user data from multiple installed applications, including Discord and various Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, OperaGX). The code extracts authentication tokens, browser cookies, and saved passwords by decrypting encrypted data using Windows APIs (win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData) and AES decryption. It writes this sensitive information into local text files named with the current user's login. Subsequently, it attempts to exfiltrate these files to attacker-controlled endpoints via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL and optionally a Telegram bot token and chat ID (though the Telegram token and chat ID are placeholders). The code performs these actions silently without user consent or notification, uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 decoding for tokens, and deletes local copies of the files after exfiltration to cover tracks. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, automated extraction and decryption of credentials, and network exfiltration are hallmark indicators of malicious intent. This code is designed to steal sensitive credentials and session tokens from the victim's machine and send them to an attacker-controlled server, constituting a severe privacy and security breach."
