      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install process to execute malicious actions during package installation. Specifically, it performs the following suspicious and malicious behaviors: \n\n1. It collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (via socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and the username (getpass.getuser()).\n\n2. It executes a shell command that overwrites the user's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file with a hardcoded SSH public key. This action effectively installs a backdoor, allowing the attacker to gain SSH access to the victim's machine without authorization.\n\n3. It sends the collected environment information as parameters in an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, attacker-controlled domain (https://8kt1lnhxv2xklpjfmtiqpdbsqjwak08p.oastify.com). This is a clear data exfiltration attempt.\n\n4. The malicious code is triggered automatically during the package installation process (via the CustomInstall class overriding the install command), without any user interaction or consent.\n\n5. The use of obfuscated variable names and the combination of environment discovery, unauthorized file modification, and network exfiltration are hallmark indicators of a supply chain attack and remote access trojan (RAT) behavior.\n\nOverall, this code is highly malicious as it silently installs an SSH backdoor, collects and exfiltrates system information, and executes these actions automatically during package installation, posing a severe security risk."
