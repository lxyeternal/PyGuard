      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, package name, and current working directory, then encodes this data in base64 and hex format. It constructs domain names by appending this encoded data to suspicious, hardcoded domains (\"sub.deliverycontent.online\" and \"www.deliverycontent.online\") and sends ICMP ping requests to these domains via shell commands. Additionally, it performs multiple HTTP POST and GET requests to these suspicious domains, transmitting the encoded environment data without any user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding and hex encoding), hardcoded suspicious external domains, automated network communication, and silent error handling strongly indicate data exfiltration behavior. This pattern matches known malicious behaviors such as environment reconnaissance and automated data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, typical of supply chain attacks or information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code executes automatically, which further confirms its malicious intent."
