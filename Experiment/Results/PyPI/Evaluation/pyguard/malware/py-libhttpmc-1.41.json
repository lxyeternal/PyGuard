      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell command). This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence logic. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated command string and the suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip). This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script but contains this covert execution, which is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
