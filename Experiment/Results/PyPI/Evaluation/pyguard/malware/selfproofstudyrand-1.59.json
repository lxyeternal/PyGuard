      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), which is typical for stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The embedded comment with a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further suggest malicious intent. The use of such obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup or installation is a known supply chain attack vector. Overall, the combination of obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates that this code is malicious."
