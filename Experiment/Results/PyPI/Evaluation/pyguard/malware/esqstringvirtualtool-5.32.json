      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded), which is a classic obfuscation and stealth technique used by malware. The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (cdnd.discordapp.com) and downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' in a hidden manner, which is a strong indicator of payload delivery or remote code execution. The presence of this behavior inside a setup script (distutils.core.setup) suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote payload retrieval combined with the lack of any legitimate user-facing functionality or notification confirms the code is malicious."
