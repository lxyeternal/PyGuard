      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class for a Python package that executes a reverse shell payload during the package installation process. Specifically, in the CustomInstall class's run method, it constructs a Python one-liner reverse shell command that connects back to a hardcoded attacker-controlled host and port (e6j4342057.zicp.fun:26264). This command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed immediately via a shell command using os.system. This behavior is a classic example of a supply chain attack where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload, the immediate execution of decoded shell commands, and the establishment of a reverse shell connection to an external, suspicious domain are all strong indicators of malicious intent. Such code enables an attacker to gain remote command execution on the victim's machine, bypassing firewalls and monitoring, which is a critical security risk."
