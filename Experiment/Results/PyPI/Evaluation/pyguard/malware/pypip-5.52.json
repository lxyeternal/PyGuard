      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command string. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The directory existence check for 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with silent execution during package setup, is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. The rest of the code is a typical setup call, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during installation strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery."
