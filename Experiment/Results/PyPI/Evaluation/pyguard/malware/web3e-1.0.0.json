      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The obfuscated class name and the use of encrypted code executed during installation strongly indicate a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. The code does not perform any legitimate installation logic before executing this hidden payload, which is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
