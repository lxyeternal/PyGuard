      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command, combined with the hidden execution, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. This behavior is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of arbitrary code during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the presence of the obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered automatically on import or install is a hallmark of malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
