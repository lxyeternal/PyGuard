      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command runs with the window style hidden and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a typical stealth behavior. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently during the setup phase (package installation) is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables execution of arbitrary, potentially harmful code without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a standard setup call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during installation is a classic supply chain attack pattern. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthy execution of hidden PowerShell commands during package installation."
