      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches PowerShell with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an -EncodedCommand argument. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell command string, which is a well-known obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to evade repeated detection. The use of PowerShell in hidden mode with an encoded command is a classic hallmark of stealthy malicious behavior, often used for executing payloads, downloading further malware, or performing unauthorized actions without user consent or notification. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) and a comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports the malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a cover or decoy. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window, conditional execution based on file system state, and suspicious metadata strongly indicates malicious behavior."
