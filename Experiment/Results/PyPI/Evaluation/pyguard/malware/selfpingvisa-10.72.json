      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which are typical stealth techniques to avoid user detection. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the embedded URL-like string 'http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm...'. This behavior is consistent with malware that executes obfuscated commands to download or run malicious payloads silently. Additionally, the code runs this payload automatically during the setup process without user interaction or consent, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The presence of a suspicious package name 'selfpingvisa' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further supports the suspicion. The try-except blocks suppress any errors, which is typical for malware to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and automatic execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
