      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) and executes a remote payload silently. This pattern of obfuscated command execution via PowerShell, combined with the use of a suspicious external URL and hidden execution, is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy payload delivery, persistence, or remote code execution. Additionally, the package name and author information appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate software, further supporting the malicious nature. The setup call is wrapped in a try/except that suppresses errors, which is typical in malware to avoid detection or interruption. Overall, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
