      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in hidden window mode (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a persistence or evasion mechanism. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup further indicate a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the hidden execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands during this process is a hallmark of malware attempting to execute unauthorized code on the host system."
