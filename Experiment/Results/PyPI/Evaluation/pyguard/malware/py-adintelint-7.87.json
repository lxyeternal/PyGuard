      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only if it does not exist, it executes the PowerShell command. The encoded command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (the comment references 'www.esquelesquad.rip', which is not a legitimate or known domain). This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly used in supply chain attacks or malware delivery. The use of try/except to silently suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is likely a decoy or cover for the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
