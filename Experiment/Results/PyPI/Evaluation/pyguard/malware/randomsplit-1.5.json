      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command, which suggests it is trying to avoid repeated execution or detection. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used for downloading, executing payloads, or performing system compromise without user consent or notification. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious behavior is triggered immediately upon import or execution, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
