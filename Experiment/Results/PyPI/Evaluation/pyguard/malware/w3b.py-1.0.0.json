      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated class name and encrypted payload hide the true intent of the code, which is executed silently during package installation. The use of exec on decrypted data, combined with network-related imports and execution triggered automatically on install, strongly indicates remote code execution and potential further malicious actions. This behavior is consistent with known malware patterns that hijack Python package installation to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the victim's system."
