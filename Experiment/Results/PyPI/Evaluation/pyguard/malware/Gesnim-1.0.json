      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, non-official GitHub URL and saves it with a suspicious temporary filename. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using a shell command ('start' on Windows) without any user interaction, consent, or validation. This behavior is triggered automatically during the package setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The combination of network retrieval of an untrusted binary and its immediate execution is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The code also restricts execution to Windows platforms and silently quits otherwise, indicating targeted malicious intent. The use of a suspicious package name and author details further supports the malicious nature. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators including downloading and executing untrusted code during installation, lack of user notification, and execution of potentially harmful payloads, confirming it is malicious."
