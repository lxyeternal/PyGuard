      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The package name 'selennuim' appears to be a typo-squatted variant of 'selenium', which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The obfuscated class name and the use of encrypted payload executed during installation strongly indicate that the package is designed to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine during installation. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code executes automatically on install, which is a critical risk indicator for malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
