      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking a web request to a suspicious URL (notably 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0'), which appears to be a remote payload download or execution. The presence of a directory existence check ('tahg') before launching the payload suggests evasion or persistence logic. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious code during package installation without user consent. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and the commented URL ('www.esquelesquad.rip') further hint at malicious intent. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, remote payload invocation, and execution during package setup strongly classifies this code as malicious."
