      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that hooks into the setuptools install command. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (a Burp Collaborator URL, commonly used for testing or malicious callbacks). This behavior is a classic example of automated data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The lack of user notification, the use of a suspicious external endpoint, and the automatic execution of network communication during install time strongly indicate malicious intent."
