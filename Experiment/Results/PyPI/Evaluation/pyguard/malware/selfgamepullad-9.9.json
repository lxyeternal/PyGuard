      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known method for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name 'selfgamepullad' with a comment referencing a suspicious domain 'www.esquelesquad.rip'. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), and suspicious package metadata strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware installation routines."
