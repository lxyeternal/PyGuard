      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only then executes the PowerShell command, which suggests stealth and evasion techniques. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip and the encoded command referencing a suspicious domain). This pattern of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote code invocation during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is used here as a cover to execute malicious code during installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
