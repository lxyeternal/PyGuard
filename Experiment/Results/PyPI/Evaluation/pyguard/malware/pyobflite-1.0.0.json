      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoelDev27/93kjasg89/main/WindowsDefender.py) into the user's home directory without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately executes this downloaded script using subprocess.run(['python', ruta]) and deletes the script file afterward. This pattern of fetching and executing remote code dynamically is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. Additionally, the code installs numerous Python packages automatically via subprocess calls to pip, which is unusual and suspicious in a setup script context. The combination of network retrieval of untrusted code, silent execution, and file deletion strongly indicates malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware that executes secondary payloads. There is no validation, user notification, or integrity check of the downloaded code, increasing the risk. The use of a generic function name (send_discord_info) that does not match the actual behavior (downloading and executing remote code) suggests obfuscation or deception. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including remote code execution from untrusted sources, automated dependency installation, and stealthy execution without user consent."
