      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute malicious behavior during package installation. Specifically, it creates a socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (104.248.19.57) on port 3334, then redirects the standard input, output, and error file descriptors to this socket. It subsequently spawns a new interactive shell (/bin/sh) connected to this socket, effectively creating a reverse shell. This allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine without user consent or notification. The execution of such code during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and unauthorized system access. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including network communication to a suspicious hardcoded IP, shell spawning, and execution triggered automatically on install."
