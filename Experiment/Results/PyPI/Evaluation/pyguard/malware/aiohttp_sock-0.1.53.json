      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with known malware patterns. Key malicious characteristics include:\n\n1. The setup script installs additional packages via subprocess calls without user consent, which is unusual and suspicious.\n2. It writes a base64-decoded Python script to a hidden temporary directory under the user's AppData local temp folder, then immediately executes a VBScript that launches this Python script silently.\n3. The embedded base64-decoded script contains extensive code that collects sensitive user data, including browser cookies, passwords, and system information, and exfiltrates this data to hardcoded external servers.\n4. The code uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding and dynamic code execution to hide its true intent.\n5. It accesses environment variables to locate user-specific directories and writes files there, a common persistence and staging technique.\n6. The code spawns subprocesses and threads to execute payloads and perform network communication stealthily.\n7. It collects and decrypts sensitive credentials, including browser cookies and passwords, and sends them to attacker-controlled endpoints.\n8. The presence of hardcoded suspicious URLs, IP addresses, and webhook endpoints used for data exfiltration.\n9. The code executes automatically during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector.\n10. The use of PowerShell launched in hidden mode with encoded commands further indicates stealthy malicious payload execution.\n\nOverall, the code is designed to stealthily collect, decrypt, and exfiltrate sensitive user data without consent, using obfuscation and multi-stage execution techniques. This behavior is characteristic of credential-stealing malware and supply chain attacks."
