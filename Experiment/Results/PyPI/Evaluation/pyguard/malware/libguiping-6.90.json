      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or performing system modifications. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands in a setup script is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution during package installation. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and the commented URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) further suggest malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands on the victim's system during package setup, which is a hallmark of malware."
