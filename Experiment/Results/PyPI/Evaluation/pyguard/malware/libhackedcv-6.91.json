      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded UTF-16LE string) executed in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This obfuscation technique is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary commands without user interaction or notification. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a conditional execution to evade repeated detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further supports malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup call for a package with a suspicious name 'libhackedcv' and author 'EsqueleSquad', which is likely a disguise. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during package setup is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling remote code execution and potential payload delivery. Therefore, this code is malicious."
