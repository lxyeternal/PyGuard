      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a temporary Python script file containing code that downloads and executes Python code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/qgu3e/raw) without any validation or user consent. It then attempts to execute this script in a new Python interpreter process. This dynamic retrieval and execution of remote code during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The use of temporary files to stage the payload, the lack of user interaction or notification, and the execution of arbitrary code from an untrusted external source all confirm that this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a temporary file and writes a Python snippet that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/qgu3e/raw) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. It then attempts to execute this temporary file using a modified Python executable name (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe') via a shell command. This pattern of dynamically fetching and executing remote code without any user interaction or validation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The code effectively enables remote code execution from an untrusted source, which is a hallmark of malware. The use of temporary files to stage the payload and the silent execution attempt (with a try/except pass to suppress errors) further supports the intent to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent involved, and the remote URL is not a known trusted source. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
