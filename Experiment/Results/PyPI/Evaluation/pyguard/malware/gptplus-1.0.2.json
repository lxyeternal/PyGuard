      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64 decoding to obfuscate and immediately execute code via exec, which is a classic malware technique to hide intent. The decoded code performs the following suspicious actions: it checks for the existence of a file named 'test.jar' in a temporary directory, and if not present, downloads it from a hardcoded GitHub raw URL. It then runs this JAR file using 'javaw.exe' in a subprocess with hidden window flags, indicating stealth execution. If the file already exists, it downloads another ZIP file from a suspicious URL (dropbox.com with query parameters) and extracts it. The code uses threading to run these operations asynchronously, evading detection. The use of hardcoded external URLs, obfuscated code execution, file downloads, subprocess spawning with hidden windows, and network activity without user consent are all hallmark signs of malware, likely designed for payload delivery or further compromise. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as code obfuscation, remote payload download and execution, stealth subprocess creation, and automated execution during package import or installation."
