      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during package installation are typical characteristics of supply chain attacks and malware. The package name 'Matpliotlib' is a typo-squatted variant of a popular library name, which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook, further indicating the intent to perform network or cryptographic operations during install. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including code obfuscation, execution of decrypted code during installation, and use of a typo-squatted package name."
