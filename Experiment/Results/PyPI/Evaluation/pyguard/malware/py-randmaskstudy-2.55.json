      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or staging technique. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further indicate suspicious origins. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it is commonly used for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, or persistence mechanisms. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Overall, this code exhibits multiple key risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and lack of legitimate user interaction."
