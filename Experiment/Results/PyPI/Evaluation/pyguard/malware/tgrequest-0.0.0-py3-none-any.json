      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords, and other sensitive user data. It collects environment information such as IP address, username, and geolocation, then exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code accesses local application data folders of browsers and Discord clients, decrypts stored credentials using Windows DPAPI and AES, and uploads stolen tokens, cookies, and passwords. It also searches user directories for files with keywords related to accounts and secrets, uploads them to anonymous file hosting services, and reports findings via the webhook. The code uses threading to perform these actions stealthily and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. It installs required dependencies silently if missing. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URLs, automated extraction and decryption of sensitive credentials, exfiltration without user consent, and obfuscation techniques (e.g., base64 decoding, encrypted keys) are strong indicators of malicious intent. This code matches multiple critical risk patterns typical of malware, including credential theft, data exfiltration, and stealthy background execution."
