      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence technique. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions, potentially downloading or executing further payloads or performing system modifications. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands in a setup script context is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling execution of arbitrary code during package installation. The author and email fields, along with the commented URL (www.esquelesquad.rip), further suggest suspicious intent. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during package setup, confirming malicious intent."
