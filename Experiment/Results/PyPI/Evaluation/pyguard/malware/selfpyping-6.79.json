      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique used by malware. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a typical evasion tactic. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or unnecessary runs. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further supports malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. This pattern—executing obfuscated PowerShell commands silently during package setup—is a known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
