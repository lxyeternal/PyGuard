      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious token grabber targeting Discord and other applications. It collects sensitive user data including Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Chrome passwords, and cookies by accessing local application data directories and decrypting stored credentials using Windows APIs. It attempts to bypass protections like DiscordTokenProtector and BetterDiscord by modifying or deleting their files. The code can kill Discord processes, hide itself, copy itself to startup for persistence, and inject malicious JavaScript code into Discord's installation directories. It collects system information (IP, location, hardware specs, Windows product key) and bundles all stolen data into a zip archive. This archive and detailed user information are exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without user consent. The code runs automatically on execution without user interaction, uses threading and asynchronous calls for stealth and efficiency, and deletes its temporary data after exfiltration. These behaviors—credential theft, environment reconnaissance, persistence mechanisms, code injection, and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints—are hallmark indicators of malware, specifically an information stealer and credential harvester."
