      "malicious_behavior": "The code is obfuscated by encoding a large Python script as a list of ASCII character codes, which is then decoded and executed via exec. The decoded script imports multiple modules commonly used in malware (e.g., subprocess, socket, requests, pycryptodome, browser_cookie3), and runs subprocesses to install various Python packages, including suspicious or uncommon ones. It defines a function that clones a GitHub repository (https://github.com/NotInfected/updater.git) into a user directory, indicating automated retrieval of potentially untrusted code. It then changes directory into that repository and runs a Python script (bypass.py) via subprocess without user interaction. The setup function call defines a package with a URL pointing to another GitHub repository (https://github.com/tuusuario/ultraobfuscator) and includes author and email fields, suggesting a supply chain attack vector. The entire code executes automatically when run as __main__, performing network operations, code download, installation of packages, and execution of external scripts without user consent or notification. These behaviors—dynamic code execution from remote sources, automated package installation, cloning and running external code, obfuscation via character codes, and lack of user interaction—are strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks, remote code execution, and potential data exfiltration or system compromise."
