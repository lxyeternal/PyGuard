      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful commands. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding, hiding its true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating a conditional payload execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The presence of a suspicious comment with a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) also suggests malicious intent. The setup call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. These patterns—obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, conditional execution based on file existence, and use within a setup script—are strongly associated with malware, supply chain attacks, or backdoor installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
