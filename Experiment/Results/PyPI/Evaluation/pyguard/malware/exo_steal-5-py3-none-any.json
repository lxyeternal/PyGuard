      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports everything from a module named 'exo-steal_file' using a relative import. The module name itself contains the word 'steal', which strongly suggests malicious intent related to data theft. The code then calls 'initialize()' from the colorama package, which is benign by itself, but the key concern is the import from 'exo-steal_file'. Since the imported module is not shown, but given the suspicious module name and the context of typical malicious patterns, this import likely triggers malicious behavior such as stealing files or sensitive data. The use of a relative import with a suspiciously named module is a common obfuscation or evasion technique in malware to hide malicious payloads within a package. Without user interaction or notification, this code likely executes malicious payloads automatically upon import or initialization. Therefore, based on the suspicious module name and import pattern, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware. It silently collects sensitive user data related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet by checking for the existence of wallet-related files and directories in the user's AppData and common user folders. It takes a screenshot of the user's screen and saves it without user consent. It then archives multiple sensitive wallet files and potentially interesting text files from Desktop, Downloads, and Documents into a zip archive. The script gathers the victim's IP address and country code, formats a message including a country flag emoji, and sends this message, the screenshot, and the zip archive containing wallet data to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, effectively exfiltrating sensitive information to an attacker-controlled Telegram channel. The entire operation is performed without any user interaction or notification, and the script attempts to clean up by deleting the zip archive after sending. The use of hardcoded Telegram bot credentials, automated data collection from sensitive wallet files, screenshot capture, and network exfiltration to an external service are strong indicators of malicious intent, specifically targeting cryptocurrency wallet theft."
