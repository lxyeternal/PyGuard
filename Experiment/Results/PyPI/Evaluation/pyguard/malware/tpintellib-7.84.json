      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window, CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag), which is a well-known technique used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary code without user consent or notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further supports the malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to facilitate installation, but the subprocess call with the encoded PowerShell command is a hallmark of stealthy malicious payload delivery and execution during package installation. This behavior aligns with known supply chain attack patterns and remote code execution techniques used by malware."
