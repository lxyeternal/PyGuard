      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded Fernet key. This pattern of decrypting and immediately executing code during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The obfuscation via encryption and the use of exec() to run the decrypted payload hide the true intent of the code, which is typical in malware and supply chain attacks. Additionally, the package name and metadata appear random and meaningless, which is common in malicious or typosquatted packages. The code also conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' only on Windows, suggesting platform-specific malicious payload delivery. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including code obfuscation, execution of decrypted payloads during installation, and lack of legitimate user interaction."
