      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known method for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name 'selfpongreplaceed' with a package directory 'modlib', which could be a typosquatting or malicious package. The presence of a hardcoded comment with a suspicious URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' further raises suspicion. The code runs this hidden PowerShell command automatically during the setup process without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious package installation behavior. Based on these factors and the known indicators of malicious Python code, this code is malicious."
