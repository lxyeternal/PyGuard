      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is immediately decoded and executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload performs multiple suspicious actions: it checks for the existence of a Windows Startup folder path, creates directories and writes PowerShell scripts (.vbs and .pyw) into the Startup folder, and executes shell commands that download and run files from a suspicious external URL (https://api-hw.com/dl/runtime and https://api-hw.com/dl/w). It also runs PowerShell commands in hidden windows, which is a known stealth technique. The payload uses subprocess to run these commands and scripts, indicating attempts to execute arbitrary code on the victim system. The use of environment variables to locate user-specific directories (APPDATA, Startup) and writing executable scripts there is a classic persistence mechanism. The code also runs these payloads during the package installation process (setup.py), which is a common supply chain attack vector. The presence of obfuscation (base64 encoding), remote code download and execution, stealth execution, and persistence mechanisms collectively confirm that this code is malicious."
