      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the executed command. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code is a typical setup call for a Python package, but the presence of this obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during the import or setup phase strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving obfuscated code execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation or import, all of which are hallmarks of malicious activity."
