      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently is a classic technique for stealthy code execution, often used for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code is a typical setup call for a Python package, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution during import or setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious package behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."
