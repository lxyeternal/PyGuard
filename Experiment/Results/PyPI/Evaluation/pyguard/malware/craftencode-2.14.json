      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command, combined with spawning a hidden process during package setup, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such behavior is commonly observed in malware to stealthily execute arbitrary or harmful code, often for persistence, payload delivery, or system compromise. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution in the setup script, which runs automatically during package installation, aligns with known supply chain attack patterns and is highly suspicious."
