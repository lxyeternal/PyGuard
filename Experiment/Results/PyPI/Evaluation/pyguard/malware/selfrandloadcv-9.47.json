      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (Base64 encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes a payload from a suspicious URL (the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip and the encoded command referencing a suspicious domain 'cdn.discordapp.com' with a path that looks like an attachment). This pattern of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution during package installation. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating stealth. The package metadata uses suspicious author and email fields, and the package name 'selfrandloadcv' and folder 'modlib' are generic and potentially typosquatted. Overall, the code attempts to execute hidden, obfuscated remote code during installation, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
