      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and user information without user consent or legitimate purpose. Such use of installation hooks to perform network communication to attacker-controlled servers is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages. The absence of any user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic combined with the exfiltration of sensitive environment data during installation strongly indicates malicious intent."
