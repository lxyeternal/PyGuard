      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The PowerShell command runs in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden) and uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag in subprocess, which suppresses any visible console window, a common stealth technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands strongly indicate malicious intent, likely for executing a hidden payload or performing unauthorized actions on the system. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload execution is triggered automatically during import or execution, without user interaction or consent. This pattern is a classic supply chain or installation-time attack vector, where malicious code is embedded in a package's setup script to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine."
