      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it runs obfuscated PowerShell code silently without user interaction or notification. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute hidden payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or unwanted runs. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further raises suspicion. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window, lack of user consent, and the use of base64 encoding for the command strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with stealthy malware or a supply chain attack."
