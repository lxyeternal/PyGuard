      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command string. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or persistence mechanism. The encoded PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and attempts to invoke a web request to download or execute further code from a Dropbox URL, which is a known tactic for fetching additional payloads or exfiltrating data. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. Additionally, the setup() call with the suspicious package name 'selfencodenvidiaurl' and author 'EsqueleSquad' appears to be a cover for this malicious activity, possibly as part of a supply chain attack or malicious package installation. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated code execution, remote code retrieval, stealth execution, and potential data exfiltration or payload delivery."
