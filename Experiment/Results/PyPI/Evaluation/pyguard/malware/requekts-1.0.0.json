      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that, during installation, conditionally executes obfuscated and encrypted code on Windows systems. Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a Fernet key and immediately executes it with exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The package name 'requekts' is suspiciously similar to 'requests' (a known library), indicating possible typosquatting. The encrypted payload is not visible in plaintext, preventing static analysis of its true intent, but the use of exec on decrypted data strongly indicates arbitrary code execution. There is no user interaction or consent before this code runs, and the behavior is triggered automatically during installation, which is a common vector for malware delivery. These factors combined make this code malicious."
