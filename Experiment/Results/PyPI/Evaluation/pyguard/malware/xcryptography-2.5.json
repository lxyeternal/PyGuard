      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, package name, and current working directory, then encodes this data in base64 and further hex-encodes it. It constructs domain names by appending this encoded data to a suspicious DNS domain ('.sub.deliverycontent.online') and performs multiple 'ping' shell commands to these domains, which is an unusual and covert method of data exfiltration via DNS queries. Additionally, the code sends HTTP POST and GET requests with the encoded data to a hardcoded suspicious domain ('www.deliverycontent.online') using multiple HTTP client libraries (urllib.request, requests, urllib), all without any user interaction or notification. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding and hex encoding), hardcoded suspicious external domains, automated network communication to attacker-controlled endpoints, and execution of shell commands for data exfiltration are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving environment reconnaissance and covert data exfiltration to command-and-control servers, consistent with supply chain attacks or information-stealing malware."
