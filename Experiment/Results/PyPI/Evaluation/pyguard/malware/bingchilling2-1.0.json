      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a temporary Python script file containing code that downloads and executes Python code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/7byac/raw) without any validation or user consent. It then attempts to execute this script in a new process using the Python interpreter in windowed mode (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe'), which is a known technique to run code stealthily without opening a console window. This dynamic retrieval and execution of remote code during the package setup process is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The code uses obfuscation by aliasing imports and writing the payload as bytes to a temporary file, then executing it immediately. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to fetch and execute arbitrary remote code silently, which poses a critical security risk including remote code execution, potential data exfiltration, or system compromise."
