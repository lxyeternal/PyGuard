      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests stealth and evasion. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially harmful commands. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads from a suspicious domain (noted in the comment as www.esquelesquad.rip). This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to execute hidden code during package installation or runtime without user consent or notification. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during import or setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious package behavior."
