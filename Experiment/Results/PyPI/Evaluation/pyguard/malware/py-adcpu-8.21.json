      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealth execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (# www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated command string. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic supply chain attack technique, where malicious code runs automatically during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of try/except to silently ignore errors further suggests an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution makes the entire code malicious."
