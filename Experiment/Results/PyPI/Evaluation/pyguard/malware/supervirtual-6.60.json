      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of an obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell command executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, this execution occurs during the package setup phase, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The directory existence check ('tahg') before execution suggests evasion or conditional payload deployment. The rest of the setup code appears benign, but the presence of this hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution during installation is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."
