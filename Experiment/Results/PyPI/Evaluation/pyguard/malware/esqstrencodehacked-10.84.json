      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded and obfuscated, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting a stealth or persistence mechanism. The PowerShell command is run with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, hiding its execution from the user. The presence of a suspicious URL in a comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the package name 'esqstrencodehacked' further suggest malicious intent. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during the setup phase is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling remote code execution and potentially downloading or executing further malicious payloads without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code (the setup call) appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious behavior. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
