      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and CREATE_NO_WINDOW creation flag, indicating stealth execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (notably the comment references www.esquelesquad.rip, which is suspicious). This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a setup script is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware that executes code during package installation without user consent. The use of try/except to silently ignore errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote code execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
