      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It checks if the current user login is not 'Tahg', and if so, it constructs a path in the TEMP directory to save an executable named 'temp-PipInstall.exe'. It then uses the Windows curl.exe utility to download an executable from a hardcoded suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/5mp5s3ta5skt5rv/esqueleDrp.exe?dl=0) into that path. After downloading, it adds a registry RunOnce key to execute this downloaded executable on next login, and immediately executes the downloaded executable silently (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This sequence of downloading an executable from an untrusted external source, writing it to a temporary location, setting persistence via registry RunOnce, and executing it without user consent or notification is a classic malware behavior pattern. The presence of comments referencing 'EsqueleStealer' and 'EsqueleSquad' further suggests credential stealing or information theft intent. The rest of the code (the setup call) appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate Python package installation script. Overall, this code is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or malware disguised as a Python package installer."
