      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation techniques, including base64 encoding and decoding of large payloads, and dynamic execution of decoded code via eval and compile. The code imports modules commonly used in malware such as requests, pyperclip, threading, and subprocess, and performs environment reconnaissance by collecting user and system information. It executes shell commands and spawns subprocesses with obfuscated PowerShell commands, which is a known stealth technique for executing malicious payloads. The code also performs network communication to suspicious, hardcoded external domains, including sending encoded data and exfiltrating sensitive information such as user credentials, environment variables, and browser cookies. It leverages Python package installation hooks to execute code during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. The presence of clipboard access combined with network exfiltration and process spawning further confirms its intent to steal sensitive data. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily collect, encode, and exfiltrate sensitive user and system data, execute arbitrary code from remote sources, and maintain persistence, all without user consent or interaction, which are hallmark behaviors of malware."
