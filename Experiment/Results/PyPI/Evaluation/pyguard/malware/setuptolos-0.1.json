      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class 'gpl' that overrides the 'run' method during package installation. Inside this method, it contains an obfuscated string 'l' which is decoded using a ROT13-like cipher to produce a string 'h'. The code then reads the system file '/etc/passwd' (variable 'f') line by line, parsing each line to find entries where the third colon-separated field equals '1000' (commonly the UID of a regular user). For each such user, it attempts to open and then append the decoded string 'h' to the user's '.profile' file located at '/home/{username}/.profile'. This behavior effectively injects hidden code or commands into user shell initialization files without user consent or notification. The injection of obfuscated content into user profile scripts during package installation is a classic supply chain attack technique, enabling execution of arbitrary code when the user logs in or opens a shell. The use of obfuscation, direct modification of sensitive user files, and execution triggered automatically during installation strongly indicate malicious intent."
