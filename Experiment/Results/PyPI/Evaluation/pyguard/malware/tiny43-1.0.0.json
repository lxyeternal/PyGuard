      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses base64 encoding to obfuscate a shell command that is executed automatically during the package installation process via a setuptools install hook (AfterInstall class). Specifically, the base64 string \"ZWNobyBob2xhIHF1ZSB0YWwgPiB0cnVlLnhtbAo=\" decodes to the shell command: 'echo hola que tal > true.xml\\n'. This command writes the string 'hola que tal' into a file named 'true.xml' in the current working directory without any user interaction or notification. The use of base64 decoding immediately followed by os.system execution during installation is a classic pattern of malicious behavior, often used in supply chain attacks to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. Although the payload here is benign in content (just echoing text to a file), the technique and context (automatic execution during install, obfuscation, and shell command execution) are strongly associated with malicious intent and supply chain compromise. This pattern is a known hallmark of malware that hijacks package installation to run unauthorized commands, potentially leading to more harmful payloads or system compromise."
