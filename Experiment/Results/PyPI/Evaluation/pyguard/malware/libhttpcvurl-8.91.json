      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is executed with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a known stealth technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup call for a package named 'libhttpcvurl' with a suspicious author and description, which appears to be a cover for the malicious payload. The use of subprocess to execute obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution without user consent or interaction. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy execution of hidden payloads during package installation."
