      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a list of executable filenames from a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt) and filters them based on the current operating system. It then downloads each executable file from the same external server, writes it to the local working directory, sets executable permissions if on Linux or macOS, and immediately executes these files in the background without any user interaction or consent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious code: automatic retrieval and execution of potentially untrusted binaries from a remote source, writing executables to the current directory without validation, and silent background execution. The use of a hardcoded IP address rather than a legitimate or trusted domain further increases suspicion. The code also hooks into all HTTP method functions (get, post, put, patch, delete, head, options, request) to call this execute() function before performing the actual HTTP request, ensuring the malicious payload is triggered whenever these functions are used. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or security checks around these operations. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware that downloads and runs remote payloads for persistence, payload delivery, or further compromise."
