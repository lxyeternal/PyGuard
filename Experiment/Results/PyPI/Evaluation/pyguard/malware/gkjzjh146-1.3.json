      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (PostInstallCommand) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it automatically executes a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP address (49.233.121.53) and port (54). The reverse_shell function decodes the host and port from base64-encoded strings, creates a socket connection to the remote host, duplicates the socket file descriptor to standard input/output/error, and spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i). This behavior enables an attacker to gain remote command execution on the victim's machine immediately upon package installation, without any user interaction or consent. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the remote address, execution of a shell during install, and network connection to a suspicious external IP are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern where malicious code is embedded in a Python package's installation process to establish a backdoor. Therefore, the code contains critical malicious behavior."
