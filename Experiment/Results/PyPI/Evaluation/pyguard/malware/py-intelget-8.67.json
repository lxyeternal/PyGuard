      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded). This encoded PowerShell command is executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, as indicated by the suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the obfuscated PowerShell command. This pattern of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup is a classic hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks that execute malicious code during installation. The rest of the code (the setup call) appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Therefore, this code is malicious."
