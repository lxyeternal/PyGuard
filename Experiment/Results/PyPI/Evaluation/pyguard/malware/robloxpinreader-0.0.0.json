      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of base64 encoding, string escaping, and dynamic evaluation (eval). It uses obfuscated variable and function names, and imports modules dynamically with eval and compile. The code decodes and decompresses large base64-encoded payloads and executes them dynamically. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true payload and executes it without user interaction or consent. The code also uses eval on decoded and decompressed data, which is a classic technique for executing hidden or dynamically generated malicious payloads. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest that the code is designed to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions, such as data exfiltration, credential theft, or remote code execution. Given the extensive obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and lack of any benign context or user interaction, this code contains malicious behavior."
