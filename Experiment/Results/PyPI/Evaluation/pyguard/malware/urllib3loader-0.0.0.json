      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding, eval, and dynamic imports, which is a common technique used to hide malicious intent. It uses eval on decoded and decompressed data, which is a strong indicator of arbitrary code execution. The code imports modules dynamically and decodes large base64-encoded payloads that are then executed, indicating payload delivery and execution. The obfuscation and decoding steps are typical of malware attempting to evade static analysis. The code does not show any user interaction or legitimate business logic and appears to execute decoded payloads immediately. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as remote code execution, payload staging, and potential data exfiltration or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
