      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information by executing shell commands to retrieve the current working directory ('pwd'), the current user ('whoami'), and the hostname ('hostname'). It then encodes this information as URL parameters and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://pt.traktrain.com/RCE_PYTHON). This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration of system information without user consent or legitimate purpose. The exfiltration occurs during the package setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The combination of environment discovery, data encoding, and immediate network transmission to an external server is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with credential-stealing or reconnaissance malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this behavior, and the external domain is not a known trusted endpoint. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
