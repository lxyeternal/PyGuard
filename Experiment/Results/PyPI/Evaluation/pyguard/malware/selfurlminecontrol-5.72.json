      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded and obfuscated, indicating an attempt to hide its true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The hardcoded URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess to execute obfuscated PowerShell commands without user interaction or notification, combined with the obfuscation and stealth execution, strongly indicates malicious intent such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise. The setup() call appears benign but is likely a cover or part of a supply chain attack vector, as malicious code is executed automatically during installation. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and potential remote code execution."
