      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with launching it in hidden mode, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern is commonly used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary or harmful commands, potentially for payload delivery, persistence, or system compromise. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. The presence of try/except blocks suppressing errors further suggests an attempt to evade detection. Overall, these factors align with multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior."
