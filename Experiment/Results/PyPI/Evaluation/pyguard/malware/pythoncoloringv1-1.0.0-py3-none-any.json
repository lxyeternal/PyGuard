      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware and information exfiltration tools. Key malicious aspects include: \n\n1. **Data Exfiltration to Attacker-Controlled Server:** The code sends system information, Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and other sensitive data to hardcoded URLs such as \"https://kekwltd.ru/relay/bluescreen\" and Discord webhooks controlled by the attacker. This is done without user consent or notification.\n\n2. **Credential Theft:** It extracts sensitive credentials from multiple browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge, Yandex, etc.) by decrypting stored passwords, cookies, credit card data, and Discord tokens using Windows APIs (CryptUnprotectData) and AES decryption. It also targets Roblox cookies and Minecraft files.\n\n3. **Clipboard Hijacking:** The `auto_copy_wallet` class monitors the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet addresses and replaces them with attacker-controlled addresses, a classic clipboard hijacking technique to steal cryptocurrency.\n\n4. **Persistence and Evasion:** The malware attempts to copy itself to the Windows startup folder for persistence. It also kills processes related to Discord and debugging tools to evade detection. It performs environment checks to avoid running in virtual machines or analysis sandboxes.\n\n5. **Stealth and Obfuscation:** The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, base64 encoding, and regexes to hide its intent. It suppresses errors and runs many operations in background threads.\n\n6. **Automated Execution:** The main execution is triggered automatically on Windows systems without user interaction, running asynchronous tasks to steal data and exfiltrate it.\n\n7. **Use of Suspicious External Resources:** The code fetches remote data from suspicious URLs (e.g., paste.bingner.com, kekwltd.ru) and uses them in regexes and configuration, indicating dynamic payload or command updates.\n\n8. **Installation-Time Execution:** The initial snippet installs packages and immediately sends system info to the attacker's server, indicating automated infection.\n\nOverall, the code is a comprehensive information stealer targeting Windows users, designed to silently collect and exfiltrate sensitive data including browser credentials, Discord tokens, cryptocurrency wallets, and system information to attacker-controlled endpoints. This behavior is unequivocally malicious."
