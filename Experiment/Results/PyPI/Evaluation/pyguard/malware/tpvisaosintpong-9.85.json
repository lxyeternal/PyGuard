      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with a hidden window and an encoded command. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification, and it runs in the background silently. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW and an encoded PowerShell command is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a known technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the package metadata includes suspicious author information and a suspicious package name, which may be typosquatting or used to disguise malicious code. The overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, stealth execution, and potential remote code execution during package installation."
