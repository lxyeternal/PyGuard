      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This obfuscation technique (base64-encoded PowerShell command) is a well-known method to hide the true intent of the command and evade detection. The command is executed without any user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), which is typical for stealthy malware. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing a non-standard domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further suggests malicious intent. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package, but the actual malicious payload is the hidden PowerShell execution. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and potential supply chain attack behavior during package installation."
