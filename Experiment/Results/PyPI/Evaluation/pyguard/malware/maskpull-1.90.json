      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The use of subprocess to spawn PowerShell with an encoded command, combined with the lack of legitimate context or user consent, strongly indicates malicious behavior. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth execution, and execution during package installation."
