      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that executes automatically during package installation. In the overridden 'run' method of the install command, it imports networking and Discord webhook libraries, retrieves the local machine's hostname and IP address, and sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes automated data collection and exfiltration of system information during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for silent transmission of host identifiers, combined with execution during the install phase, strongly indicates malicious intent."
