      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or conditional execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, as indicated by the suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the obfuscated command string. This pattern of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell execution in a setup script is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware that execute code during package installation. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script but contains this hidden malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
