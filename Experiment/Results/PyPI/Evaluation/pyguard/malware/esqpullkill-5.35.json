      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string (base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell command). This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally based on the absence of a directory named 'tahg' suggests stealth and evasion. The encoded command likely performs unauthorized actions such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as indicated by the suspicious URL comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the obfuscated command content. This pattern—obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup—is a well-known malware technique for stealthy code execution, persistence, or payload delivery. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is benign, but the embedded subprocess call with obfuscated PowerShell is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
