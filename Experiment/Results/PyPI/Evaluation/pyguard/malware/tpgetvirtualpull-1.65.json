      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads from a suspicious URL (notably the comment references 'www.esquelesquad.rip', which is suspicious). This pattern of obfuscated command execution during package setup or initialization is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The use of try/except to silently suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the code appears to be a setup() call for a Python package, which is likely a disguise to deliver the malicious payload during installation. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window, triggered automatically without user interaction, combined with suspicious naming and comments, confirms malicious intent."
