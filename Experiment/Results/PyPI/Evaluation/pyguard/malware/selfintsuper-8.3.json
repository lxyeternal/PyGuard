      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded). The command is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions, such as invoking web requests or executing further payloads, as suggested by the suspicious URL fragment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' in the comment and the encoded command string. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to execute obfuscated commands silently during package installation or execution. The presence of this obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution combined with the lack of user interaction or notification, and the use of a suspicious domain, strongly indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses errors, which may be used to hide the malicious activity. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands on the host system without user consent, which is a hallmark of malicious software."
