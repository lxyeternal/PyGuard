      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation techniques, including confusing variable and function names, and executes code dynamically via exec and eval. The code contains a large embedded binary blob assigned to a dictionary key, which is then inserted into a global dictionary via the _modulo method, suggesting hidden payload storage or staging. The code dynamically compiles and executes code from obfuscated sources, including use of globals()['eval'](globals()['compile'](...)) patterns, which is a classic malware technique to hide and execute payloads. The presence of suspicious URLs in metadata (e.g., discord.gg/plague) and the use of obfuscation markers (__obfuscator__ = 'Hyperion') further support malicious intent. The code also performs arithmetic and type manipulations that serve no clear benign purpose, likely to confuse analysis. The overall structure and behavior match known malware patterns such as code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and payload staging. Therefore, this code is malicious."
