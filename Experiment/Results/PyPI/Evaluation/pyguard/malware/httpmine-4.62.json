      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is executed without user interaction or notification and runs in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the command from casual inspection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The PowerShell command itself invokes 'Invoke-WebRequest' to download and execute a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), then runs it with output redirected to a hidden file. This behavior is consistent with malware that downloads and executes a secondary payload without user consent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, downloading and running an external executable, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
