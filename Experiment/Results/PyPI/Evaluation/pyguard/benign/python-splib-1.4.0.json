      "malicious_behavior": "The code primarily imports various components from internal modules and a version module, which is typical for a package's __init__.py or API exposure file. The only potentially suspicious part is the use of subprocess.Popen to run a Python command that imports 'dist_util' from 'shopeeloggingtool'. However, this subprocess call is wrapped in try-except blocks and does not perform any further actions such as executing arbitrary code, downloading files, or exfiltrating data. The subprocess commands are simple import statements, which could be part of a lazy loading or initialization routine. There is no evidence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network communication, or file system manipulation beyond this. The code does not match any of the typical malicious patterns such as executing shell commands with encoded payloads, downloading or running external code, or exfiltrating data. Therefore, based on the provided knowledge points and analysis, this code does not contain malicious behavior."
