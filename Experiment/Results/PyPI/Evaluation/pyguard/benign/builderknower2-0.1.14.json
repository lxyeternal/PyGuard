      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation command for a Python package using setuptools. It overrides the install command to run some shell commands during installation, such as listing the root directory contents to a file named LICENSE, checking for the presence of curl and wget, and touching a file in /tmp. However, all network-related commands and potentially harmful commands (e.g., curl commands to external URLs) are commented out and not executed. The executed shell commands are benign and mostly for demonstration or logging purposes. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or contact with suspicious external servers. The package name and code do not indicate typosquatting or suspicious intent. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior based on the provided analysis criteria."
