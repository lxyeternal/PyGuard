      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a build and binding generation script for the 'blst' cryptographic library, specifically targeting Emscripten compilation to WebAssembly and JavaScript bindings. It performs environment checks for the 'emcc' compiler, optionally uses Docker to build if 'emcc' is not found, generates C++ and JavaScript binding source files, and then invokes Emscripten to compile the sources into a JavaScript output file. The code includes no obfuscated payloads, no network communication, no dynamic code execution from untrusted sources, no data exfiltration, no suspicious subprocess calls, and no attempts to access or manipulate sensitive user data or system resources. All file operations are related to source code generation and compilation within the current working directory or project structure. The subprocess calls are legitimate build commands, and user interaction is requested only to confirm Docker usage. The code is well-structured, includes comments indicating it is auto-generated or part of a build process, and does not exhibit any known malicious patterns or behaviors."
