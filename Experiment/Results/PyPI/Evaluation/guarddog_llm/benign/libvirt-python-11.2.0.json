The flagged lines use subprocess.check_output to invoke system commands (such as git and pkg-config) to gather build metadata (authors, changelog, build flags, etc.). These are standard operations in build scripts and are not used to execute arbitrary or user-supplied code. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or other malicious activity. The security tool likely flagged these lines because subprocess can be used for code execution, but in this context, the usage is legitimate and controlled.",
