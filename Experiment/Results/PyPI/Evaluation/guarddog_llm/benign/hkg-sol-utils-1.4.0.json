The first command performs a DNS query (dig) to a hardcoded domain (install14.api.pygrata.com) using a public DNS resolver (1.1.1.1), which can be used for exfiltration, tracking, or signaling. The second command attempts to install or update a package (pygrata-utils) from PyPI using pip. Executing arbitrary network and installation commands in a setup script is a common technique used by malicious packages to download and execute further payloads or to track installations. This behavior is not standard or necessary for legitimate Python package installation and is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
