The arguments to the subprocess call are strictly controlled and constructed from a fixed list of options ('libs', 'cflags'), and there is no user input or untrusted data being passed to the shell. This is a common and safe pattern in build scripts to detect and configure external dependencies. There is no evidence of code execution for malicious purposes, data exfiltration, or other harmful behavior.",
