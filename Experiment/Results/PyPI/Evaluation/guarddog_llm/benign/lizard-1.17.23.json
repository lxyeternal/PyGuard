      "false_positive_reason": "The code flagged by the tool is an HTML template string that includes a footer with a link to 'http://www.lizard.ws/'. This is a standard practice for open-source tools to credit their website or project. The link is static, not dynamically generated, and does not perform any tracking, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. The rest of the code is a typical HTML report generator using Jinja2 templates. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as code execution, data theft, or exploitation. The detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of an external link, which is not inherently malicious.",
