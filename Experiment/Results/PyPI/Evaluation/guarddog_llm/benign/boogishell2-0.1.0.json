      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command (CustomInstallCommand) that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, it executes os.popen('ls /').read(), which runs a shell command to list the root directory. While this specific command is not directly harmful, it demonstrates the ability to execute arbitrary shell commands during package installation, which is a common technique used in malicious Python packages (supply chain attacks). Furthermore, there is a commented-out line that would open a reverse shell to a remote IP address if uncommented, indicating clear intent for malicious post-install behavior. The presence of this code in the install process is highly suspicious and not standard practice for legitimate packages.",
