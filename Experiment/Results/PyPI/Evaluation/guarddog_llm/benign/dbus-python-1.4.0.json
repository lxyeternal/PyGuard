This is a common and legitimate pattern in Python packaging for projects that use native code or require complex build systems. There is no evidence of arbitrary or user-supplied command execution, nor any attempt to execute code from untrusted sources. The subprocess calls are tightly scoped to expected build commands and do not present malicious intent. The security tool likely flagged these due to the generic risk of subprocess usage, but in this context, it is standard and necessary for the package's operation.",
