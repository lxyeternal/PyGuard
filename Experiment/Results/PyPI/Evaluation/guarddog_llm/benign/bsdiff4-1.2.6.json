While the use of eval() on file content can be risky if the file is untrusted or user-controlled, in this context it is a common (though not best-practice) pattern in Python packaging scripts to extract a version string. The regular expression is designed to match a line like __version__ = '1.2.3', and eval() is used to parse the quoted string. There is no indication that this code is intended to execute arbitrary or malicious code, and the file being read is part of the same package. However, for improved safety, ast.literal_eval() should be used instead of eval().",
