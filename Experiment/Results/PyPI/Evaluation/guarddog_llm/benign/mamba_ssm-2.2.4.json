      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines use subprocess.check_output to invoke system binaries (nvcc and hipcc) to query the installed CUDA or HIP version. This is a common and legitimate practice in Python build scripts (such as setup.py) for packages that need to compile native extensions against CUDA or ROCm. The commands are not constructed from untrusted input, and there is no evidence of arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activity. The subprocess calls are strictly for environment detection and version checking, which is standard in scientific and machine learning Python packages. Therefore, the security tool's detection is a false positive in this context.",
