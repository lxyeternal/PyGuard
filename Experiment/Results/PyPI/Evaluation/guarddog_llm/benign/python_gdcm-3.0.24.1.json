      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged subprocess calls (to patchelf, install_name_tool, cmake, etc.) are standard and expected in Python build scripts that compile and package C/C++ extensions, especially those using CMake and SWIG. These tools are used to configure, build, and adjust shared library dependencies and RPATHs for cross-platform compatibility. There is no evidence of arbitrary or user-supplied code execution, network activity, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. The subprocess invocations are tightly controlled and use fixed, build-related commands. The security tool likely flagged these due to the generic risk of subprocess execution, but in this context, it is a false positive.",
