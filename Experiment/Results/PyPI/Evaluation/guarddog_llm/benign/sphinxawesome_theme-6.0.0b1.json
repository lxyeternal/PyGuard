The flagged line (html_baseurl = \"https://sphinxawesome.xyz/\") simply sets the base URL for the generated documentation, which is standard practice for Sphinx sites, especially when generating sitemaps or canonical URLs. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code execution, or other malicious activity. All other URLs in the configuration point to legitimate documentation or project resources. The detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of a non-standard domain, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or behavior.",
