The commands are not constructed from untrusted user input, and there is no evidence of arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious intent. The use of subprocess here is for environment detection and configuration, not for executing arbitrary or attacker-controlled code. This is a common pattern in Python build scripts, especially those that need to support multiple platforms and dependency discovery.",
