      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines send data to a URL specified by the MONITORING_URL environment variable. The data being sent includes metadata about database operations (such as instance name, client ID, schema/table names, row/column counts, and local path), but does not include actual sensitive data like database contents, credentials, or user data. This pattern is typical for monitoring, auditing, or logging purposes in enterprise applications. The code does not attempt to exfiltrate confidential information to an external or hardcoded server, nor does it attempt to hide its network activity. The use of environment variables for the destination URL is a common practice for configurable monitoring endpoints. Therefore, the tool's detection is a false positive.",
