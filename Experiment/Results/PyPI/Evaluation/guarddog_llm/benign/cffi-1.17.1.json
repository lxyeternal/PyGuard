This is a common and legitimate pattern in build scripts, especially for Python packages with C extensions. The code does not execute arbitrary user input or download/execute remote code. All subprocess calls are for build-time configuration and do not pose a security risk in this context. The security tool likely flagged this due to the generic use of subprocess, but in this context, it is not malicious.",
