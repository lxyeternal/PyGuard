While using shell=True with subprocess calls can be risky if untrusted input is passed, in this context, the commands are constructed from known build tools and static file paths, not user input. This is a common pattern in build scripts to invoke external tools. There is no evidence of code execution for malicious purposes, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions. The detection is a false positive due to the generic risk of shell=True, but in this controlled build context, it is not malicious.",
