These commands create a .nojekyll file and copy built documentation files into a temporary git repository before pushing to the gh-pages branch. While the use of os.system can be risky if untrusted input is used, in this context the inputs are controlled and there is no evidence of code execution for malicious purposes. The code does not attempt to exfiltrate data, download remote payloads, or perform any harmful actions outside the expected documentation deployment workflow. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
