The arguments to this function are constructed from trusted sources within the script (e.g., f\"{kc} --libs gssapi\"), not from untrusted user input. This is a common and necessary pattern in build scripts to detect system library paths and flags. There is no evidence of code execution based on untrusted input, data exfiltration, or other malicious activity. The use of shell=True is justified in this context and does not, by itself, indicate malicious intent.",
