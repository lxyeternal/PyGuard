There is no evidence of arbitrary or remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious intent. The subprocess calls are deterministic, use fixed arguments, and do not process untrusted input. This is a common pattern in cross-version Python projects, and the code is consistent with open-source packaging best practices.",
