The arguments are hardcoded and not influenced by user input, and the context is a standard setup.py script for a legitimate open source project. There is no evidence of arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious intent. The use of subprocess here is a common and expected pattern in build scripts. The security tool likely flagged this as a generic code execution pattern, but in this context, it is not malicious.",
