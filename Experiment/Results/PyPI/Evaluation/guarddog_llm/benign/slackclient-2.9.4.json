All subprocess calls use explicit, hardcoded commands or arguments derived from the Python environment or user-supplied test targets, and do not execute arbitrary or user-supplied shell code. This is a common and accepted pattern in Python packaging scripts. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or other malicious intent. The detection is a false positive due to the generic use of subprocess for automation.",
