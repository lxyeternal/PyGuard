      "false_positive_reason": "The code in question is a standard build script for the PyICU Python package, which is a wrapper for the ICU C++ library. The flagged lines involve the use of subprocesses to invoke system utilities (such as 'icu-config' and 'pkg-config') to detect library versions and compiler/linker flags. This is a common and necessary practice in build scripts to ensure the correct configuration of C/C++ extensions. There is no evidence of arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious intent. The subprocess calls are limited to well-known system utilities and are not user-controlled beyond standard environment variables. The security tool likely flagged these lines due to the generic use of subprocesses, which can be risky in other contexts, but in this case, their use is justified and not malicious.",
