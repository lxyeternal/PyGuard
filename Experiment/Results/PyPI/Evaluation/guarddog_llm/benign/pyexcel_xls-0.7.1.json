The commands (GS_COMMAND and PUBLISH_COMMAND) are statically defined and do not take user input, so there is no risk of arbitrary code execution or command injection. This is a common pattern in Python packaging scripts to automate build and release processes. No evidence of malicious intent or behavior is present in the code.",
