This is standard practice for cloud SDKs to obtain credentials securely from the instance metadata service. The code does not exfiltrate data, send credentials to external servers, or perform any other malicious actions. The detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the use of a non-localhost IP and the presence of credential-related keywords in the URL.",
