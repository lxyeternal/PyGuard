This is a common practice in CLI tools to direct users to further resources. The code does not attempt to download, execute, or interact with this URL programmatically; it is only present in a help message. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code execution from remote sources, or obfuscation. The detection is a false positive due to the presence of a shortened URL in a help string.",
