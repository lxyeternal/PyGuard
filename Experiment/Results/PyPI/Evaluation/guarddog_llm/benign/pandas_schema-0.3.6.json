The commands are hardcoded, do not take untrusted input, and are only executed as part of custom build commands (not during normal package installation or import). There is no evidence of arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious intent. The security tool likely flagged these lines due to the generic use of subprocess, but in this context, the usage is benign and controlled.",
