This is a common and legitimate practice in Python build scripts (such as setup.py) for machine learning libraries that need to detect the system's GPU toolkit version to configure compilation. The commands are not constructed from untrusted input, and there is no evidence of arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious intent. The subprocess calls are strictly for environment detection and do not pose a security risk in this context.",
