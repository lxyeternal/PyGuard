This is a standard and expected operation in Python packages that use Cython for performance. The subprocess call is not executing arbitrary or user-supplied code, but rather a well-known build tool (cython) on source files included in the package. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or other malicious activity. The security tool likely flagged this due to the use of subprocess, which can be risky in other contexts, but in this case it is a false positive.",
