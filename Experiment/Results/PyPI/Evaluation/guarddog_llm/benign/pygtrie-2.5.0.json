This is a standard and expected use case in Python packaging workflows for generating Sphinx documentation. There is no evidence of arbitrary or user-controlled input being executed, nor any attempt to run unexpected or harmful commands. The subprocess call is tightly scoped and does not present a code execution risk in this context. The detection is a false positive due to the generic flagging of subprocess usage, which is not inherently malicious.",
