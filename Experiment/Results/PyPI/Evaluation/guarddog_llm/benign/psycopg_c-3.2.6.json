This is a standard and expected practice in Python build scripts that need to locate PostgreSQL headers and libraries for compiling C extensions. The argument passed to pg_config is controlled by the function parameter 'what', but its usage is limited to known, safe options within the build process context. There is no evidence of arbitrary or user-controlled code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activity. The subprocess call is not inherently dangerous in this context and is a common pattern in setup scripts for database adapters.",
