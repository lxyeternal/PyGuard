      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line (result = getattr(builtins, node.id)) is used in the context of an AST visitor to resolve variable names, including built-in names, during the recomputation of values from an abstract syntax tree. This is a common and legitimate pattern in code that interprets or analyzes Python code, as it allows the visitor to access built-in functions and constants (such as 'len', 'all', 'None', etc.) when they are referenced in the code being analyzed. There is no evidence of code injection, privilege escalation, or other malicious intent. The use of getattr on builtins is controlled and only used to resolve names that are not found in the local variable mapping. The rest of the code is consistent with a static analysis or contract-checking tool, and there are no suspicious behaviors such as network access, file system manipulation, or dynamic code execution outside of controlled AST compilation for analysis purposes.",
