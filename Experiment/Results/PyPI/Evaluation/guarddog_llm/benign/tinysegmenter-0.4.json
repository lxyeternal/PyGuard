These are standard operations in Python packaging and documentation workflows. The subprocess calls do not execute arbitrary or user-supplied code, nor do they interact with the network or perform any suspicious actions. The only other subprocess call is in the test command, which runs a local test script. All subprocess usage is controlled, expected, and not indicative of malicious behavior.",
