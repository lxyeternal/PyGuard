This is a common and legitimate pattern in build scripts to detect system capabilities. The command is constructed from fixed header and library names, not user input, and is not used to execute arbitrary or attacker-controlled code. The rest of the script is a standard setuptools-based build script for a Python C++ extension. There is no evidence of code execution for malicious purposes, data exfiltration, or other suspicious behavior.",
