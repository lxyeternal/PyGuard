This is a common and legitimate pattern in build scripts to query system configuration for compiling C extensions. The command and option are not derived from untrusted user input at runtime, but from environment variables or hardcoded values. There is no evidence of arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious intent. The subprocess call is used solely for build-time configuration, which is standard practice in Python packaging.",
