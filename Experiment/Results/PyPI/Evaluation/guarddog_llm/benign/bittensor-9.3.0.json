This is a common and legitimate technique in networking utilities and does not exfiltrate sensitive data, execute arbitrary code, or interact with suspicious endpoints. The code does not collect, transmit, or process any user data beyond the public IP, and all endpoints are well-known public IP-checking services. Therefore, the detection is a false positive.",
