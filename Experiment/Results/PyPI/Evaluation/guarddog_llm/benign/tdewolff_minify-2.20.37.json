This is a common and legitimate pattern for Python packages that wrap Go code. The command is not dynamically constructed from untrusted input, and the context is a build script (setup.py) for a package that is open source and well-known. There is no evidence of code execution for malicious purposes, data exfiltration, or other harmful behavior. The security tool likely flagged this due to the generic use of subprocess for code execution, but in this context, it is expected and not malicious.",
