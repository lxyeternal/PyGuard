      "false_positive_reason": "The code in question is a standard setup.py script for the dm_control package. The flagged lines are: (1) the use of subprocess.check_call(command) to invoke a code generation script (autowrap.py) as part of the build process, and (2) the use of the setup() function to define the package metadata and installation process. While subprocess.check_call can be used for arbitrary code execution, in this context it is only used to run a local script (autowrap.py) with arguments derived from the build environment and not from untrusted user input. This is a common and accepted pattern in Python packaging for generating bindings or other build artifacts. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or other malicious behavior. The tool likely flagged these lines due to the presence of subprocess usage and the setup() function, which are common in both benign and malicious code, but in this context they are not being misused.",
