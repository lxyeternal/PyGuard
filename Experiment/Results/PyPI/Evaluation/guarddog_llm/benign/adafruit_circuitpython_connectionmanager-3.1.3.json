The presence of 'discord.com' in a list of common hosts is not inherently malicious; it is simply included as a test endpoint. The code does not exfiltrate data, execute remote code, or perform any unauthorized actions. All network activity is limited to connection attempts for the purpose of connectivity and certificate validation testing. The security tool likely flagged the code due to the presence of 'discord.com', which is sometimes associated with data exfiltration in malicious scripts, but in this context, it is benign.",
