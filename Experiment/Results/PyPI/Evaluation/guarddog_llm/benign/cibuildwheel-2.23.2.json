This is a common and legitimate pattern in many Python utilities and build tools, especially those that need to fetch resources or dependencies from the internet. The function does not exfiltrate local sensitive data to a remote server; it only reads from a remote URL and writes to a local file. There is no evidence in the code of any attempt to send local data to an external server, nor any suspicious network activity. The security tool likely flagged this due to the presence of a network call, but in this context, it is benign and expected.",
