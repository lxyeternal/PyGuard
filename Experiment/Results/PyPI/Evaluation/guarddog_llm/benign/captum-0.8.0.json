The command being executed is a static shell script (./scripts/build_insights.sh) that is part of the project's source tree, and its execution is gated behind an environment variable (BUILD_INSIGHTS). There is no evidence of user-supplied or untrusted input being passed to subprocess, nor is there any attempt to download or execute arbitrary code. This is a common and expected pattern in Python build scripts to automate build steps. The security tool likely flagged this due to the generic risk of subprocess usage, but in this context, it is not malicious.",
