This is a common and expected pattern in Python packaging, especially for modules that require compilation and configuration steps. The command is not constructed from untrusted input, and there is no evidence of code injection or execution of arbitrary or attacker-controlled code. The use of os.system here is limited to running a known script in the project directory, not for executing user-supplied commands. Therefore, the security tool's detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the generic use of os.system, which is often flagged in static analysis tools regardless of context.",
