The request is made to an expected endpoint using authenticated headers, and the data being sent (project_id, name, x_token) is not sensitive user data but rather parameters required for token creation. There is no evidence of exfiltration of sensitive user data to an unauthorized third-party server. The code is consistent with standard CLI tooling for authenticated API access and configuration management. The security tool likely flagged this due to the presence of a POST request with a token, but in this context, it is expected and not malicious.",
