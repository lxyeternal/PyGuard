The use of subprocess.Popen in the git_version() function is only to retrieve the current git commit hash for versioning purposes, not for arbitrary code execution. The setup() function is a standard setuptools call for package configuration and installation. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or other malicious intent. The security tool likely flagged these due to generic patterns (subprocess usage and setup() calls), but in this context, they are benign and expected.",
