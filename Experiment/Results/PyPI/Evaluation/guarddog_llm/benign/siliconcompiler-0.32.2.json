The code does not exfiltrate local sensitive data to an external server; instead, it retrieves remote data and extracts it locally. There is no evidence of data being sent out from the local system, nor are there suspicious network operations or obfuscated code. The security tool likely flagged this due to the presence of a network request, but in this context, it is a standard and expected behavior.",
