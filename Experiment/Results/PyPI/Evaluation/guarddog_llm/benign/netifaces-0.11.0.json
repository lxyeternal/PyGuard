The use of os.popen is only to execute a temporary compiled C test binary as part of a build-time feature check, which is a standard practice in Python extension build scripts (similar to autoconf). There is no evidence of code injection, exfiltration, or other malicious intent. The code is a typical setup.py for a C extension package (netifaces), and the flagged patterns are common in such scripts.",
