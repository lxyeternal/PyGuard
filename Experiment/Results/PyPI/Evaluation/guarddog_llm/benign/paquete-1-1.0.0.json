However, in this specific instance, the function notmalfunc() calls os.system(b64d(\"\")), which decodes an empty string and thus executes an empty command. As written, this does not perform any harmful action. There is no actual payload or command being executed. The code could easily be modified to become malicious by inserting a base64-encoded payload, but in its current form, it is inert. The security tool likely flagged this due to the presence of a custom install command and the use of os.system with base64 decoding, which are common in malicious packages, but the actual code is not malicious as provided.",
