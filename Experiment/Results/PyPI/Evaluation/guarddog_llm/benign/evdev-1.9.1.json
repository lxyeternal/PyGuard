The commands are constructed with explicit arguments, do not take untrusted input, and are used to generate source files required for the package. This is a common and legitimate pattern in Python package setup scripts, especially those that need to generate code at build time. There is no evidence of arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activity. The security tool likely flagged these lines because subprocess.run can be used for code execution, but in this context, its use is standard and not dangerous.",
