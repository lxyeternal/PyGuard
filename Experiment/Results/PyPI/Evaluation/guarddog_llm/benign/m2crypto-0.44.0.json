These subprocess calls are standard practice in build scripts to adapt to different system environments and do not execute arbitrary or user-supplied code. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or other malicious intent. The security tool likely flagged these due to the generic risk of subprocess usage, but in this context, their use is legitimate and expected for a build script.",
