      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines (os.system and subprocess.call) are used to ensure that a required shell script (autogen.sh) is executed before proceeding with the setup process. This is a common pattern in build scripts to generate necessary files or metadata before installation. The code does not download or execute arbitrary code from the internet, nor does it attempt to exfiltrate data or perform any harmful actions. The use of os.system and subprocess.call is limited to running local scripts and re-invoking the setup process, which is expected behavior in this context. Therefore, the security tool's detection is a false positive due to the generic nature of code execution detection.",
