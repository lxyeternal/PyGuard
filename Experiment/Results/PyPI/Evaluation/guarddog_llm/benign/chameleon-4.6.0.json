This is a common pattern in code that manipulates or analyzes Python ASTs, such as template engines or code generators. The code as a whole is part of a template code generation and AST transformation utility, likely for the Chameleon templating engine. There is no evidence of code execution, data exfiltration, obfuscation for malicious intent, or other harmful behaviors. The use of getattr on builtins is not inherently dangerous in this context and is used for introspection, not for hiding or executing arbitrary code. The security tool likely flagged this due to a generic pattern match for obfuscation, but in this context, it is a false positive.",
