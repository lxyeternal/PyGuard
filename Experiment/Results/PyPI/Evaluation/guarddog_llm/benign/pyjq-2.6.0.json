The commands executed are standard build commands (./configure, make, make install, etc.) on extracted source code, and the inputs are controlled by the package itself (not user-supplied or downloaded from untrusted sources at runtime). There is no evidence of arbitrary or user-supplied code execution, nor any attempt to download or execute remote code. This is a common pattern in Python packages that need to build native extensions or dependencies. The security tool likely flagged this as a generic code execution pattern, but in this context, it is not malicious.",
