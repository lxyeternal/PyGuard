      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines use os.popen to execute the 'odbc_config' command-line tool in order to retrieve compiler and linker flags for building the pyodbc extension. This is a standard and common practice in Python build scripts (setup.py) to dynamically determine build settings based on the system's ODBC configuration. The commands are not user-controlled, do not execute arbitrary input, and are only used to read configuration output. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or other malicious intent. The security tool likely flagged these lines due to the use of os.popen, which can be risky in other contexts, but in this case, its use is benign and expected for this type of build script.",
