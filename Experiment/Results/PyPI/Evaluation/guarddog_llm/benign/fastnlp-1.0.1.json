These are standard operations in cloud and ML environments: the first is a common way to introspect the running container for logging or telemetry, and the second is a typical API call to fetch model information. There is no evidence in the code that any sensitive data is being exfiltrated to unauthorized endpoints, nor is there any code that collects, packages, or sends user data outside of expected, documented API interactions. The code is consistent with open-source ML library utilities and does not demonstrate malicious intent.",
