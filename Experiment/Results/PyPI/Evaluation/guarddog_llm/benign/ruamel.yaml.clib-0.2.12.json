These are common patterns in advanced setup.py scripts and are not used to execute arbitrary or attacker-controlled code. The commands are constructed from known, controlled values (e.g., 'pip install .', or a path derived from package names), and there is no evidence of code injection, exfiltration, or other malicious intent. The use of these functions is justified by the need to automate package installation steps, not to perform unauthorized actions.",
