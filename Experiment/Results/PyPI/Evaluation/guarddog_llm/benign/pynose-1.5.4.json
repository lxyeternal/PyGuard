All os.system calls are only executed if the script is run with the 'publish' argument and after explicit user confirmation. There is no evidence of code that exfiltrates data, downloads or executes arbitrary code from untrusted sources, or performs any harmful actions outside the standard package publishing workflow. The use of os.system for these tasks is common in Python packaging scripts, and the flagged behavior is expected and benign in this context.",
