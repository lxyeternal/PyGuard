It deletes the 'dist' directory, which is a common step to ensure old build artifacts are removed before creating new distribution files. This is not malicious in this context, as it does not delete arbitrary files or directories outside the project scope. The rest of the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, such as exfiltrating data, executing arbitrary code from untrusted sources, or modifying system files outside the expected package management operations.",
