This is a standard and expected operation in many Python projects that use protobufs. The subprocess call is not accepting arbitrary user input, and the command is constructed from known paths and environment variables, not from untrusted sources. There is no evidence of code execution for malicious purposes, data exfiltration, or other harmful behavior. The security tool likely flagged this due to the generic risk of subprocess execution, but in this context, it is a common and necessary build step.",
