The pre_install_script and post_install_script methods are empty and do not perform any actions. Overriding the install command itself is not inherently malicious; it only becomes a concern if these methods are used to execute harmful code, which is not the case here. The rest of the setup() call is standard package metadata. The security tool likely flagged this due to the custom install command, but in this instance, there is no evidence of malicious behavior.",
