      "false_positive_reason": "The code uses eval() to parse a version tuple from a line in the __init__.py file, which is a common but discouraged practice in Python packaging. While eval() can be dangerous if used on untrusted input, in this context it is only used to parse a version tuple (e.g., VERSION = (1, 2, 3)) from a file that is part of the same package and under the developer's control. There is no indication that this code is intended to execute arbitrary or malicious code. The use of eval() here is a minor security risk if the __init__.py file is ever modified by an attacker, but this is not inherently malicious in the context of this setup script. The security tool flagged this due to the presence of eval(), but in this specific use case, it is a false positive.",
