      "false_positive_reason": "The code implements a standard OAuth2 client for Discord, using official Discord API endpoints for authorization, token exchange, revocation, and user profile retrieval. These endpoints are public and expected for any legitimate Discord OAuth2 integration. No credential exfiltration, data theft, or unauthorized actions are present. The flagged URLs are not inherently malicious; they are required for OAuth2 flows. The detection is a false positive likely due to the presence of OAuth2 endpoints, which are sometimes abused in token-stealing malware, but in this context, their use is legitimate and follows best practices.",
