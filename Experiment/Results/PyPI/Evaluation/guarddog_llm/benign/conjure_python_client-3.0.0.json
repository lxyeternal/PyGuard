This is a common pattern in Python packaging to provide a 'format' command for developers. The commands do not execute arbitrary or user-supplied input, and only run a well-known formatting tool. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or other malicious activity. The security tool likely flagged this due to the use of os.system, which can be risky in other contexts, but in this case the usage is benign and controlled.",
