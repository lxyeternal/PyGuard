This is a known technique to enable f-string support in older Python versions via the 'future-fstrings' package. The injected code does not execute arbitrary or external code, nor does it exfiltrate data or perform privilege escalation. While .pth file injection can be abused for malicious purposes, in this context it is used for a legitimate compatibility enhancement. There is no evidence of malicious intent or behavior in this code.",
