The code only copies the contents of a file (selected by the user via command-line arguments) to the clipboard, and does not attempt to read arbitrary clipboard data or exfiltrate it. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, keylogging, or other malicious clipboard manipulation. This is a common and benign pattern in developer tools to facilitate code sharing or pasting. The rest of the code is consistent with a legitimate open-source project (xlwings) for Excel automation.",
