These are standard practices in some advanced setup.py scripts and are not used to execute arbitrary or attacker-controlled code. The commands are constructed from known, controlled values (e.g., 'pip install .', or installing a local package by path), and there is no evidence of code injection, exfiltration, or other malicious intent. The use of these functions is for package management, not for executing untrusted input.",
