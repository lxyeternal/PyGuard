This is a common and legitimate pattern in Python package setup scripts to ensure the correct include paths are used for pybind11. The subprocess call is not used to execute arbitrary or user-supplied code, nor does it interact with the network or sensitive system resources. The rest of the code is standard for a setup.py file. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
