      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line (member = getattr(builtins, segments[0], None)) is used in the context of a dynamic import utility function (_import_string), which is a common pattern in dependency injection frameworks and configuration-driven code. This line allows the code to resolve references to built-in Python objects by name, which is not inherently malicious. The rest of the code is focused on schema processing, provider instantiation, and dependency injection, with no evidence of code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. The use of getattr on builtins is not dangerous by itself unless untrusted input is passed, but in this context, it is part of a controlled schema processing mechanism. Therefore, the detection is a false positive.",
