      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged code is a standard use of setuptools.setup() with custom build commands (cmdclass) for a Python package. Overriding or extending setuptools commands is a common and legitimate practice in Python packaging, especially for projects that require custom build steps (e.g., ANTLR code generation, cleaning, or custom sdist/build logic). There is no evidence of code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious behavior in this setup script. The detection is likely a false positive due to the presence of custom cmdclass entries, which some static analysis tools may flag as potentially risky without context.",
