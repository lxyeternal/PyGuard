This is a common and legitimate pattern in Python projects that include Java components. The command is constructed from static paths and a version string, and does not use untrusted user input. There is no evidence of arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activity. The security tool likely flagged this due to the use of subprocess.call, which can be risky if misused, but in this context it is safe and expected.",
