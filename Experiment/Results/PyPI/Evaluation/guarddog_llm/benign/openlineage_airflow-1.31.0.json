This is a common and benign pattern in open source tools that need to display or link to repository files in a web browser. The code does not exfiltrate data, connect to shady domains, or perform any suspicious network activity. The rest of the code is standard utility logic for Airflow/OpenLineage integration. The detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the dynamic URL construction, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or behavior.",
