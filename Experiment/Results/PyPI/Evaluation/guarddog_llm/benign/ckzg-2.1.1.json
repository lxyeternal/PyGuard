This is a common and legitimate pattern for building native extensions that require compilation of C/C++ code or dependencies (in this case, the 'blst' library). There is no evidence of arbitrary or user-supplied code execution, network activity, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. The code is consistent with standard Python packaging practices for projects with native components.",
