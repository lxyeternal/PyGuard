The flagged line (server_list = [\"oast.pro\", ...]) simply lists the official interact.sh servers. The code does not exfiltrate data, execute arbitrary code, or perform any malicious actions by itself. It only interacts with interact.sh servers to facilitate OOB testing, as described in the documentation and comments. The detection is a false positive likely due to the presence of domains commonly used in security testing, not because of any actual malicious behavior.",
