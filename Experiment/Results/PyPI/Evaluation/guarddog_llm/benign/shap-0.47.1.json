This is a standard and expected operation in packages that provide CUDA-accelerated functionality. The code does not execute arbitrary user input or download/execute remote code; it only builds local source files. The subprocess call is not inherently malicious in this context, and the rest of the code is consistent with typical build scripts for Python packages with C/C++/CUDA extensions. The security tool likely flagged this due to the generic risk of subprocess execution, but in this case, it is a false positive.",
