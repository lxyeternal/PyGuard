      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines are standard for Python package build scripts, especially those involving native extensions. The use of subprocess.run and self.spawn to invoke compilers and make is typical for building C/C++ extensions (e.g., compiling code for different architectures, running make to build dependencies). The setup() function's cmdclass customization is also a common pattern to extend or override setuptools behavior for custom build steps. There is no evidence of arbitrary or user-supplied code execution, network activity, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. The code is consistent with legitimate build automation for a Python package with native components.",
