There is no evidence of arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious intent. The commands are static, not constructed from user input or external sources, and are typical in setup.py scripts for automating package release. The security tool likely flagged these lines due to the general risk of os.system, but in this context, their use is legitimate and expected.",
