The code only sends progress updates to a user-specified chat via a bot, as described in the documentation and usage examples. The security tool likely flagged the code due to the presence of the Telegram API endpoint, which is commonly used in both benign and malicious contexts, but in this case, the usage is appropriate and documented.",
