      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines involve the use of subprocess functions (check_call and check_output) to execute a local shell script (./scripts/preinstall.sh) and to invoke a local binary (curl-config) to retrieve linker flags. This is standard practice in Python packaging scripts, especially when building native extensions that depend on external libraries. The script does not download or execute remote code, nor does it perform any suspicious or harmful actions. The use of these subprocess calls is limited to the build process and is not inherently malicious. The security tool likely flagged these lines due to the generic risk of code execution, but in this context, the behavior is expected and not malicious.",
