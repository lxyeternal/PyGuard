The CustomInstall class's run() method only prints 'hello world' and does not execute any suspicious or harmful actions. Although there are commented-out lines that, if enabled, would exfiltrate system information (hostname, username, current working directory) to an external server via an HTTP GET request, these lines are not active code. Therefore, the script as provided does not perform any malicious behavior. The detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of the commented-out suspicious code and the use of a custom install command.",
