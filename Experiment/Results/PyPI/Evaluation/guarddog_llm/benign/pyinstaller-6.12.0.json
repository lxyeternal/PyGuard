The command is constructed with sys.executable and a local script ('./waf'), and the working directory is set to a known source directory. There is no evidence of arbitrary or user-supplied code execution, network activity, or attempts to evade detection. This is standard practice in build scripts that need to compile native components. The subprocess call is not inherently malicious in this context, and the rest of the code is consistent with legitimate package setup and build logic. The security tool likely flagged this due to the generic use of subprocess, but in this context, it is a false positive.",
