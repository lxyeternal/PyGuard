      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines are all related to standard build, installation, and packaging operations for a Python C++ extension module using setuptools and CMake. The use of self.spawn to execute commands like 'python -m pip -V', 'cat CMakeCache.txt', 'cp', 'rm', 'tar', and 'ls' are typical in complex build scripts that need to manage dependencies, move/copy build artifacts, and clean up directories. There is no evidence of code that exfiltrates data, downloads or executes arbitrary code outside the build context, or otherwise performs actions outside the expected scope of a build system. The code is open source, references a public repository, and the author is identified. The security tool likely flagged these due to the presence of subprocess execution, which is a common false positive in build scripts.",
