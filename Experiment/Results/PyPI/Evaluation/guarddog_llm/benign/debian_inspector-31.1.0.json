The code is part of a utility for interacting with the DejaCode service to fetch, update, and create package data, which is its intended and documented purpose. There is no evidence of exfiltration of sensitive or unrelated local data to unauthorized endpoints. All data sent appears to be related to package metadata, and the endpoints are configurable, intended for legitimate API usage. The code does not access or transmit arbitrary files, environment variables, or user data outside of its documented scope. The security tool likely flagged these lines due to the presence of network requests, but in this context, they are expected and not malicious.",
