The subprocess call does not execute arbitrary or user-supplied code, nor does it interact with the network, filesystem (beyond reading the SDK path), or sensitive data. This is a common pattern in cross-platform Python package setup scripts. The security tool likely flagged this due to the use of subprocess, but in this context, it is not malicious.",
