This is a common and legitimate pattern in build scripts to adapt compilation flags based on the detected compiler version. The command is not user-controlled and does not execute arbitrary code; it simply queries the compiler for its version. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or other malicious activity in the code. The detection is a false positive due to the presence of subprocess.run, which is often flagged by static analysis tools as a potential risk, but in this context, its use is benign and necessary for the build process.",
