The first command performs a DNS query to 'install.api.pygrata.com' using a public DNS resolver (1.1.1.1), which can be used for tracking installations or exfiltrating data. The second command attempts to install or update the 'pygrata-utils' package via pip, which could be used to introduce additional malicious code or dependencies without the user's consent. Executing arbitrary commands during package installation is a common technique used in malicious Python packages to persist or escalate attacks.",
