This is a common pattern in libraries that need to support both versions, not an obfuscation or malicious technique. The rest of the code consists of utility functions for PDF processing and does not exhibit any malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or unauthorized access. The security tool likely flagged these lines due to the dynamic attribute access, which can sometimes be used for obfuscation, but in this context it is benign and for compatibility.",
