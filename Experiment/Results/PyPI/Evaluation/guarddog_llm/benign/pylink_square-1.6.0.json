      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line (output = subprocess.check_output('make', shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)) is used within a custom setuptools command (BDDTestCommand) to automate building firmware as part of a test process. While the use of subprocess with shell=True can be risky if untrusted input is passed, in this context the command is hardcoded ('make') and the working directory is controlled by the test suite. There is no evidence of arbitrary or user-supplied input being executed, nor any attempt to exfiltrate data or perform harmful actions. This is a common pattern in build/test automation scripts. The security tool likely flagged this as a generic code execution pattern, but in this context it is not malicious.",
