      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged code is part of a legitimate function that submits test analytics data to the Buildkite Test Analytics API. The code uses an API token from an environment variable and sends JSON payloads to a known Buildkite endpoint. There is no evidence of exfiltration to an unauthorized or suspicious destination, nor is there any indication of attempts to steal sensitive data. The use of the 'post' function to a well-known API endpoint is expected in this context. The detection is likely a false positive due to the generic pattern of sending data over HTTP, which is common in many legitimate applications.",
