      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines involve the use of subprocess.call and subprocess.run to execute build-related commands (such as 'make', 'msbuild', and 'dsymutil') within the context of a Python setuptools/distutils build script. This is standard and expected behavior for a setup.py file that needs to compile C extensions or perform platform-specific build steps. The commands are not constructed from untrusted user input, and there is no evidence of arbitrary or remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activity. The security tool likely flagged these lines because executing system commands can be risky in general, but in this context, it is a normal part of the build process.",
