The flagged line is the call to setup(), which is expected in such files. While the script does import subprocess and defines a pip_install() function, this function is not called anywhere in the script, and there is no evidence of code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. The use of setup() to define package metadata and configuration is normal. The security tool likely flagged this due to the presence of setup() (which can, in rare cases, be abused), but in this context, it is benign and standard practice.",
