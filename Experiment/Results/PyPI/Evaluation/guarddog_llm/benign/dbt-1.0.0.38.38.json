      "false_positive_reason": "The code uses a custom setuptools install command (PostInstallCommand) to download a platform-specific binary from the official dbt-labs GitHub releases and extract it into the Python environment after installation. This pattern is common for Python packages that need to bundle or install native binaries not available on PyPI. The download URL is hardcoded to the official dbt-labs repository, and there is no evidence of code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. The flagged 'cmd-overwrite' is due to the use of the 'cmdclass' argument in setup(), which is a standard way to extend setuptools behavior. While this technique can be abused, in this context it is used transparently and for a legitimate purpose.",
