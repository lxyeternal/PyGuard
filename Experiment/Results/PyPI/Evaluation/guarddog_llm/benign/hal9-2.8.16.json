However, the code is structured as a deployment utility, likely for uploading project assets to a legitimate service (e.g., hal9.com, as referenced in the error message). The files being uploaded are from a user-specified directory, and the API key is required via an environment variable, which is a standard practice for authenticated API usage. There is no evidence of exfiltration to an attacker-controlled or suspicious domain, nor is there any attempt to stealthily collect or transmit sensitive data outside the expected workflow. The code's behavior is consistent with a deployment or asset upload tool, not malware.",
