The flagged lines (use of Popen and the setup() function) are common in build scripts: Popen is used to invoke build tools (cmake, make, compilers) as part of the build process, and setup() is the standard setuptools/distutils entry point for Python package installation. There is no evidence of arbitrary or user-supplied code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. All subprocess calls are to expected build tools with controlled arguments. The tool likely flagged these due to generic patterns (code execution, command overwrite) that are not malicious in this context.",
