While the use of eval() can be dangerous if the input is untrusted, in this context it is only evaluating a line from the package's own __init__.py file, which is under the developer's control. This is a common (though not ideal) pattern in Python packaging to avoid duplicating the version string. There is no evidence of code injection, exfiltration, or other malicious intent. The use of eval() here is a potential security risk if the source file is modified by an attacker, but in standard usage, it is not malicious.",
