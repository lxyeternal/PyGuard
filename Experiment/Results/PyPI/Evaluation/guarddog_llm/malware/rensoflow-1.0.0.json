The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making its behavior intentionally obfuscated and hidden from static analysis. This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it allows for arbitrary code execution. The package metadata is also nonsensical, which is typical of malicious or typosquatting packages.",
