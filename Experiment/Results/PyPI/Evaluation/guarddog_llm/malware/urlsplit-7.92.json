The PowerShell command is run with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag to avoid user detection and uses '-EncodedCommand' to obfuscate its intent. This is a common technique used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user knowledge. The use of obfuscated PowerShell, hidden execution, and conditional logic to avoid repeated execution are all strong indicators of malicious behavior.",
