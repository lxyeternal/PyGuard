It performs the following malicious actions: (1) Steals Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and sensitive files from the victim's system. (2) Decrypts and exfiltrates credentials and authentication tokens by uploading them to a hardcoded Discord webhook and to transfer.sh. (3) Searches for and zips files with sensitive keywords (e.g., passwords, wallet, crypto, bank) from common user directories and uploads them. (4) Kills browser and wallet processes to access locked files. (5) Installs dependencies at runtime to ensure it can run on the victim's machine. (6) Uses multiple shady and hardcoded URLs for exfiltration. (7) Attempts to evade detection by running in threads and using error suppression. (8) Gathers information about the victim's accounts, billing, and friends on Discord, Steam, and Roblox. (9) The code is clearly designed for data theft and unauthorized access, not for any legitimate purpose.",
