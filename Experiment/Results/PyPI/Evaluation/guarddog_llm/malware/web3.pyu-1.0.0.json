It defines a custom install command for the package setup process that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, and the decryption key is hardcoded. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide and execute malware, such as information stealers, backdoors, or downloaders, on the victim's machine. The obfuscated class name and suspicious metadata further support the assessment that this package is designed to evade detection and perform harmful actions.",
