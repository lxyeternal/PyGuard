Specifically, it XOR-decrypts a long, encoded string (wopvEaTEcopFEavc) using a numeric key (iOpvEoeaaeavocp), reconstructs a Python script, and then executes it using eval(compile(..., 'exec')). This is a classic technique for hiding and executing arbitrary or malicious code during package installation, which can be used to run backdoors, downloaders, or other harmful payloads on the victim's machine. The use of try/except to silently ignore errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and ensure execution. This behavior is highly suspicious and matches known patterns of malicious Python packages (e.g., supply chain attacks).",
