The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as WindowsCache.exe in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is classic dropper/backdoor behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and execute additional payloads. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and the check for a marker file ('tahg') are further indicators of malicious intent and an attempt to evade detection.",
