The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string and is decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide and execute malware, such as information stealers, backdoors, or downloaders, without the user's knowledge. The obfuscated metadata (random author, email, and description) further suggests an attempt to evade detection and attribution.",
