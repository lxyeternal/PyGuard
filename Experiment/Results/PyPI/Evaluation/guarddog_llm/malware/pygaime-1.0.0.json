The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, and the key is hardcoded. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation, making detection and analysis more difficult. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The package metadata (name, author, description) is also suspiciously random, which is common in malicious or typosquatting packages.",
