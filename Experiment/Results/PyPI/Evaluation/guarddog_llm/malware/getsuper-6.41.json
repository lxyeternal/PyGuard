The PowerShell command is encoded and obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand flags is typical of attempts to run malicious code without user visibility. This behavior is not consistent with normal package setup scripts and is indicative of a trojan or backdoor attempting to download or execute further payloads from a remote server.",
