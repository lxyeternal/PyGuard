The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This is a common technique used in supply chain attacks to deliver malware via Python packages. The package name 'tensogflow' is also a typosquat of 'tensorflow', which is a known tactic for tricking users into installing malicious packages.",
