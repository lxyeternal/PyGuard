The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of exec on decrypted data is a common technique for hiding and executing malicious code. This behavior is triggered automatically during package installation, which is a typical method for supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscated class names, suspicious author/email, and the presence of encrypted code strongly indicate malicious intent.",
