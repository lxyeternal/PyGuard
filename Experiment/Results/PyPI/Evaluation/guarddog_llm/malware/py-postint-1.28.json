The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a common technique to obfuscate malicious activity. The decoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to run it. This behavior is consistent with a downloader or dropper, which is a common form of malware.",
