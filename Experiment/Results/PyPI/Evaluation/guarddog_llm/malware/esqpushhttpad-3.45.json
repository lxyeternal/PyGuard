      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is only run if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), and its decoded content appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and then running it. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, often used to bypass detection and deliver a second-stage payload. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' further indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity from the user.",
