Specifically, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt and execute a payload (via exec) that is not visible in the source code. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or other attacks, during the installation of a seemingly benign Python package. The use of encrypted payloads and runtime decryption is a strong indicator of intent to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions.",
