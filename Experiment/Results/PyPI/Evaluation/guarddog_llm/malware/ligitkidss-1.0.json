It then attempts to execute this script using a renamed Python executable (pythonw.exe) in a new process. This is a classic pattern for remote code execution and is commonly used in malware to download and run arbitrary code from the internet without user consent. The use of obfuscation (aliasing imports, writing to a temp file, and launching with pythonw.exe to avoid a console window) further indicates malicious intent.",
