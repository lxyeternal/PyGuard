The payload is not visible in plaintext, making its intent and actions deliberately obfuscated. This is a common technique used by malware to hide malicious code from static analysis and evade detection. Executing arbitrary, hidden code during package installation is a clear indicator of malicious behavior, as it can perform any action on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent.",
