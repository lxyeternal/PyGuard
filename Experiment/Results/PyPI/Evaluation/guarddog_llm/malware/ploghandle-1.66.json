It then concatenates this data, encodes it in base64, and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to an external IP address (http://1.15.77.2/v/...). This is a clear example of data exfiltration. Additionally, the use of subprocess.Popen to execute a potentially arbitrary file (the 'version' file) with Python, without any validation or clear purpose, is suspicious and could be used for further code execution or persistence.",
