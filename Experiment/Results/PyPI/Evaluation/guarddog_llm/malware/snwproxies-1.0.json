      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a credential and information stealer, commonly referred to as a 'stealer' malware. It performs the following malicious actions: (1) Searches for and extracts Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and cryptocurrency wallet data from the victim's machine. (2) Decrypts and exfiltrates sensitive data such as passwords and cookies from Chromium-based browsers using the local master key. (3) Uploads stolen data to a Discord webhook (hardcoded in the variable 'hook') and to external file sharing services (e.g., transfer.sh). (4) Searches the user's Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders for files containing sensitive keywords (e.g., 'password', 'wallet', 'crypto', etc.) and uploads them. (5) Kills browser and wallet processes to access locked files. (6) Installs dependencies at runtime, which is a common evasion technique. (7) The code is heavily focused on data theft and exfiltration, with no legitimate user functionality. (8) The presence of Discord webhook URLs, exfiltration logic, and targeted search for sensitive data are all strong indicators of malware.",
