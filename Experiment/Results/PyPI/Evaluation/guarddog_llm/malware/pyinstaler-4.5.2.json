(2) It downloads an executable file (ini_file_pyp_41.exe) from another suspicious domain (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr) and executes it automatically using os.system('start '+filename) if the platform is Windows. (3) The malicious actions are triggered automatically after package installation by overwriting the setuptools install command via cmdclass={'install': PostInstallCommand}, ensuring the payload runs as soon as the package is installed. These behaviors are typical of Python-based malware distributed via PyPI or similar channels.",
