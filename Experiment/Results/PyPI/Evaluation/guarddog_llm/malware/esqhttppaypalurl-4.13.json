The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), and its decoded content appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious external URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and then running it. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, often used in malicious Python packages to infect systems upon installation or import.",
