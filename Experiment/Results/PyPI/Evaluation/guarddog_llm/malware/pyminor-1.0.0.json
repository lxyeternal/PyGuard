During installation, it decodes an obfuscated string using an XOR operation with a numeric key, then executes the resulting code using eval(compile(..., 'exec')). This is a classic technique for hiding and executing arbitrary or malicious code during package installation. The obfuscated payload could perform any action, including downloading and executing further malware, stealing data, or creating backdoors. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
