The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string and is only decrypted and executed at install time. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code, as the actual behavior is obfuscated and only revealed at runtime. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and is a common method for running arbitrary, potentially harmful code. The package metadata is also suspicious (randomized names, emails, and descriptions), which is typical of malware attempting to masquerade as a legitimate package.",
