The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making static analysis difficult and strongly indicating an attempt to hide malicious activity. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a common technique for running arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine during package installation. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malware or supply chain attacks.",
