The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string and is only decrypted and executed at install time. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code, such as backdoors, downloaders, or other forms of malware, during the package installation process. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution. The obfuscated class name and nonsensical metadata further indicate an attempt to evade detection.",
