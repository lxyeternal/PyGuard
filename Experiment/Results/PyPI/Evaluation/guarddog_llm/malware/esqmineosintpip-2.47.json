      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' command. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its activity and execute potentially harmful commands without user knowledge. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a typical evasion technique. The use of 'WindowStyle Hidden' further indicates an attempt to avoid detection by the user. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent (downloading and running remote code). The rest of the code is a decoy setup.py for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package.",
