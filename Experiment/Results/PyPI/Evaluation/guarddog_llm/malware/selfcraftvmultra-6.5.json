The PowerShell command is encoded and, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic example of a downloader/dropper, which is a common malware technique. The use of a hidden PowerShell window, encoded commands, and remote file execution are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
