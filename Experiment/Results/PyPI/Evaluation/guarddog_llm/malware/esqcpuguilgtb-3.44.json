The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, but decoding it reveals that it downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, often used to deliver malware. The rest of the code is a decoy (setup.py metadata).",
