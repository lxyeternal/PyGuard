The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common technique for evading detection and running potentially harmful commands without user visibility. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe', and then runs them. This behavior is consistent with malware that attempts to download and execute additional payloads on the victim's machine.",
