Decoding the payload reveals that it imports sensitive modules (os, subprocess), collects the current user's login name, and attempts to create directories and write files in the user's AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\System64 directory. It writes and executes multiple files with suspicious names (e.g., WIN32.vbs, WIN32.bat, runtime.zip, pythonw.exe, Windows Helper.exe, stub.pyw), downloads files from remote servers (e.g., https://api-hw.com/dl/runtime, https://api-hw.com/dl/w), and runs them with elevated privileges. The code also attempts to remove traces of its activity. This behavior is consistent with a dropper or loader for further malware, and is highly malicious.",
