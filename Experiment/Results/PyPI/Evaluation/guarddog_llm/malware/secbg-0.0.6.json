This is done outside of any normal package installation or setup process, and the imported module is not a standard library. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute Python code from a potentially untrusted package (secrevtwo) is a common technique used in malicious packages to execute arbitrary code on the user's system during installation. This behavior is highly suspicious and is often associated with supply chain attacks in Python packages.",
