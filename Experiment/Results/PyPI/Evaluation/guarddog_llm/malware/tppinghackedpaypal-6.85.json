      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded, but the use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand is a common technique to hide malicious activity and evade detection. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as WindowsCache.exe, then runs it. This is a classic dropper/downloader behavior, which is highly indicative of malware. The rest of the code is a decoy setup.py for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package.",
