(2) It downloads a Windows executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr) and saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', then executes it using os.system('start '+filename). This is a strong indicator of a second-stage payload delivery, which is a common technique in malware to download and execute further malicious code. (3) The malicious logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command (PostInstallCommand), ensuring that the payload is executed automatically upon package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector in Python packages.",
