The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, making its intent less obvious, but the use of 'Invoke-WebRequest' and the download URL (dl.dropbox.com) strongly suggests it is downloading and executing a remote file (Esquele.exe) to the victim's machine, then running it. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution. The rest of the code is a decoy (setup.py for a Python package).",
