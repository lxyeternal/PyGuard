(2) It downloads a Windows executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr) and saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe', then executes it using os.system('start '+filename). This is a classic technique for delivering and executing a second-stage payload, which could be malware. (3) The malicious logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command (PostInstallCommand), ensuring the code runs automatically when the package is installed, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks. All these behaviors are strong indicators of a malicious Python package.",
