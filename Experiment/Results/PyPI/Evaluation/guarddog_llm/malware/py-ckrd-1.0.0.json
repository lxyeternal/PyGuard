The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, and is executed via exec(). This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation, making it difficult to detect the actual behavior statically. The use of exec() on decrypted code, especially in a setup.py install hook, is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the target system during package installation.",
