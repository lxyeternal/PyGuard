The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making its behavior intentionally obfuscated and difficult to analyze statically. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent and evade detection. The use of exec() on decrypted code is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The package metadata (name, author, description) is also nonsensical, which is typical of malicious packages attempting to masquerade as legitimate ones (e.g., 'BeautifulSoupe' mimicking 'BeautifulSoup').",
