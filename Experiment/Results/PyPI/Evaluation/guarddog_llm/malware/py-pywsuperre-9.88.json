      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag, which hides the PowerShell window. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, often used to deliver malware. The check for the existence of the 'tahg' file is likely an anti-redundancy or anti-analysis measure. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) and hidden execution further indicate malicious intent.",
