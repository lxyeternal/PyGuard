      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and likely downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to run it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a common malware technique. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and EncodedCommand is intended to evade detection and hide execution from the user. The rest of the code is a decoy setup.py for a Python package, which is a common method for distributing malicious code via PyPI or similar repositories.",
