(2) It downloads a Windows executable (python-install.scr) from a suspicious domain (https://python-release.com), saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and then executes it using os.system('start '+filename). This is a classic pattern for delivering and executing a second-stage payload, which could be malware. (3) The malicious actions are triggered automatically upon package installation by overriding the setuptools install command (cmdclass={'install': PostInstallCommand}), ensuring the payload is executed without user consent. These behaviors are consistent with known Python package supply chain attacks.",
