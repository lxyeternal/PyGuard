      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' command. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its activity and execute potentially harmful commands or download and run additional payloads. The use of 'WindowStyle Hidden' ensures the PowerShell window is not visible to the user, further indicating an attempt to conceal its actions. The encoded command, when decoded, appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious external URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), save it as 'Esquele.exe', and then run it, which is a clear sign of malicious behavior (downloading and executing remote code).",
