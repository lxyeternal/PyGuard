The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making its behavior intentionally obfuscated and difficult to analyze statically. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent and bypass static analysis. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The package metadata (name, author, email, description) is also suspicious and appears randomly generated, which is typical of malicious or typosquatted packages.",
