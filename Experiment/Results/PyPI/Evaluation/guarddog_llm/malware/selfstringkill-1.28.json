The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic example of a downloader/dropper, which is a common malware technique. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and misleading package metadata) further indicates malicious intent.",
