The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making its intent and actions intentionally obfuscated. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its true behavior from static analysis and to evade detection. The use of exec() on decrypted code is highly suspicious and is a strong indicator of malicious activity, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. Additionally, the package name 'Matplottib' is a typosquat of the popular 'matplotlib', which is a common tactic used to trick users into installing malicious packages.",
