(2) It downloads a Windows executable (python-install.scr) from another remote server (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and then executes it using os.system('start '+filename). This is a classic pattern for delivering and executing a second-stage payload, which is highly suspicious and often used in malware. (3) The malicious logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command (PostInstallCommand), ensuring that the payload is executed automatically when the package is installed, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks in Python packages.",
