The _post_install function collects the installer's public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname, and the installation path, encodes this information in base64, and sends it to an external server (https://kotko.org) via an HTTP GET request. This exfiltrates potentially sensitive information about the user and their environment without their knowledge or consent, which is a clear indicator of malicious behavior (specifically, data exfiltration and potential tracking).",
