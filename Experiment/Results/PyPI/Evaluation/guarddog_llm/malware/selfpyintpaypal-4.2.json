The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/tpykidpdjz99202/esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as a temporary executable (~\\tmp-lvnsoass.exe), then runs it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, often used to infect systems with malware. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and EncodedCommand further indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity.",
