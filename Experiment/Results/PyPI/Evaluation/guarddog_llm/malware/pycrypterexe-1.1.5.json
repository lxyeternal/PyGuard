Specifically, it: (1) Steals WiFi passwords by running 'netsh wlan show profile' and extracting cleartext passwords; (2) Extracts and decrypts all saved Chrome passwords and cookies, including using Windows DPAPI and Chrome's local key; (3) Scrapes Discord tokens from multiple browsers and Discord installations; (4) Uploads all stolen data to a remote file hosting service (gofile.io) and sends links to a hardcoded Discord webhook, providing the attacker with access to the victim's credentials and tokens; (5) Optionally provides a reverse shell capability, allowing remote command execution on the victim's machine. The code is explicitly designed for malicious use, as indicated by its documentation and class names (e.g., 'EvilPIP Malware').",
