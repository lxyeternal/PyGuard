During the installation process (via a custom setuptools install command), it attempts to open the /etc/passwd file, parse it for users with UID 1000 (typically the first non-root user on a Linux system), and then writes an obfuscated payload (decoded from the variable 'l') into the file /home/<user>/.profile. This is a classic persistence technique used by malware to execute code when the user logs in. The obfuscation of file paths and the payload, as well as the silent exception handling, are clear indicators of malicious intent.",
