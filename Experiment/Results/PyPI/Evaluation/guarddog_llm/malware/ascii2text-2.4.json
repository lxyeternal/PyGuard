This is a classic technique for downloading and executing potentially malicious payloads. Additionally, it overwrites a Python package file ('ascii2text/__init__.py') with code fetched from another remote URL, which could be used for persistence or further malicious actions. The use of suspicious remote URLs, writing to system directories, and executing downloaded code are all strong indicators of malware.",
