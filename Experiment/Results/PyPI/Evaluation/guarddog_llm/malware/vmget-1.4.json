The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common technique for executing obfuscated or hidden commands, often used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user knowledge. The encoded command appears to invoke a web request to 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0' and saves the output as 'WindowsCache.exe', then executes it. This is a clear attempt to download and run an external executable, which is a hallmark of malware.",
