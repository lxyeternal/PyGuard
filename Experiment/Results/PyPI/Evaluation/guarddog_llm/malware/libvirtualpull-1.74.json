The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded, but the use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand is a common technique for hiding malicious activity. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a clear example of a downloader/dropper, which is a common malware behavior.",
