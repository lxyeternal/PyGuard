      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' command. This is a common technique used by malware to execute obfuscated or hidden commands on a victim's machine. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a typical evasion technique. The use of 'WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' further indicates an attempt to hide the execution from the user. The base64-encoded PowerShell command appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent (downloading and running remote executables). The rest of the code is a decoy (setup.py metadata).",
