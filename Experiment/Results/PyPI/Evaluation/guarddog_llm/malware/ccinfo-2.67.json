The encoded command (base64) is obfuscated and is executed in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden, CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download or execute additional payloads without user knowledge. The check for the existence of the 'tahg' file is likely used as a marker to avoid repeated execution. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and ensure execution. This is not normal behavior for a setup.py file, which should only contain package setup logic.",
