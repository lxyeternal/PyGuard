It defines a custom install command that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload via exec(). The decryption key and encrypted data are hardcoded, and the decrypted code is executed at install time, which is a common technique for hiding and running malicious code (such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or further malware downloads). The package name 'BeaitifulSoup' is a typosquat of the legitimate 'BeautifulSoup', further indicating intent to deceive users. The use of obfuscated class names and meaningless descriptions also points to an attempt to evade detection.",
