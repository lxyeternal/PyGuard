The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed at install time, making its behavior intentionally obfuscated and difficult to analyze statically. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its true functionality and evade detection. The use of exec() on decrypted code, especially in a package named similarly to a popular library ('BeautifuklSoup' vs 'BeautifulSoup'), strongly suggests an attempt to trick users into installing a malicious package (typosquatting). The presence of suspicious author information and the lack of legitimate package functionality further support this conclusion.",
