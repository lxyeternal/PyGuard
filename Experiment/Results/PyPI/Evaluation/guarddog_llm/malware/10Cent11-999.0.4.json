It does this by creating a socket connection to the remote host, redirecting the standard input, output, and error file descriptors to the socket, and then spawning a shell (/bin/sh) using the pty module. This allows the remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running the installation. This is a classic example of a backdoor or remote access trojan (RAT) embedded in a Python package setup script.",
