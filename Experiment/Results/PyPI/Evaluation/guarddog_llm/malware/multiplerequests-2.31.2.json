The downloaded payload is executed via exec after base64 decoding, which allows arbitrary code execution from a remote source. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, and is highly indicative of malicious behavior, as it allows the remote server to run any code on the victim's machine without their knowledge.",
