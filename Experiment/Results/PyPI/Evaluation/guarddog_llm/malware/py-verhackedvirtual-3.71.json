The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, but decoding it reveals that it downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is classic dropper/backdoor behavior, often used to infect systems with malware. The use of a hidden window and encoded command further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
