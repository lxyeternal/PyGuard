Specifically, it attempts to escalate privileges to administrator using ShellExecuteW with 'runas', then downloads a file named 'image.png' from a remote server (http://wpp-api-01hw.onrender.com) using a custom header, writes it to disk, and decodes its contents from base64. The downloaded file is not validated or checked, and its contents are printed (potentially as a way to execute or exfiltrate data). This behavior is highly suspicious and matches common patterns of malicious Python packages (e.g., privilege escalation, remote payload download, and execution during install). The use of misleading package metadata and a suspicious author email further supports the assessment.",
