This behavior is triggered automatically during both the 'develop' and 'install' phases of the package setup process, meaning that simply installing or developing this package will result in the download and execution of an untrusted binary. This is a classic example of a supply chain attack, where a Python package is used as a vector to deliver and run potentially malicious code on the victim's machine. The executable's purpose is unknown, but the method of delivery and execution is highly suspicious and dangerous.",
