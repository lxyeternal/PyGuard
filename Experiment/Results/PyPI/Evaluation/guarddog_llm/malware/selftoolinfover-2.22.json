This is a common technique used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user visibility. The encoded command, when decoded, appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe', and then attempts to execute them. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, specifically a downloader or dropper.",
