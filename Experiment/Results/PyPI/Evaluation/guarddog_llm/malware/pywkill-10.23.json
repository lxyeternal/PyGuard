The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a typical method to obfuscate malicious activity. Decoding the base64 string reveals that it downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a clear example of a downloader/dropper, which is a common malware behavior.",
