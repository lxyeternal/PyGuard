The PowerShell command is encoded and appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbuqmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a common malware technique. The use of a hidden PowerShell window and encoded commands is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
