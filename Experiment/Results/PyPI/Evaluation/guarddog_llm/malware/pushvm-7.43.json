The encoded command (base64) is obfuscated, but its presence is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as this technique is commonly used to download and execute additional payloads or perform other unauthorized actions without user consent. The command is only executed if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' further attempts to hide the execution from the user. This behavior is not typical for legitimate Python package setup scripts and is a hallmark of malware or trojanized packages.",
