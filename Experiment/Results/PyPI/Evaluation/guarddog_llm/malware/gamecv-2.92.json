The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common technique for executing obfuscated or hidden commands on Windows systems, often used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user knowledge. The encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes them. This is clear evidence of a downloader/dropper behavior, which is highly malicious.",
