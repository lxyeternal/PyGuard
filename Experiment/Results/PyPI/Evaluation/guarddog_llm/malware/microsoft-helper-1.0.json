It then attempts to execute this script using a likely-obfuscated Python executable (by replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe'). This is a classic pattern for remote code execution and is commonly used in malware to download and run arbitrary code from the internet. The use of obfuscation, temporary files, and remote code execution is highly suspicious and dangerous.",
