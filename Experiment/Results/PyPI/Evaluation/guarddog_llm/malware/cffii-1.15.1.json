This is a standard and common practice in Python build scripts (such as setup.py) to dynamically determine compiler and linker flags for building C extensions. The code does not execute arbitrary user input, nor does it download, execute, or exfiltrate data. The subprocess call is tightly controlled and only interacts with the system's pkg-config utility. The rest of the script is consistent with a legitimate build configuration for a Python C extension. The security tool likely flagged this due to the generic use of subprocess, but in this context, it is not malicious.",
