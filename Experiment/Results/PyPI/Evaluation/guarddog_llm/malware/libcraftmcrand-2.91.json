      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic example of a downloader/dropper, which is a common malware technique. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW is intended to hide the execution from the user. The rest of the code is a decoy setup.py for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious intent.",
