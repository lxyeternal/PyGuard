This behavior is triggered every time any of the HTTP request wrapper functions (get, post, put, patch, delete, head, options, request) are called, regardless of the actual intent of the HTTP request. This is a classic pattern for a loader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and executes additional payloads from a command-and-control server. The use of a hardcoded IP address, the lack of any user interaction or validation, and the automatic execution of downloaded binaries are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
