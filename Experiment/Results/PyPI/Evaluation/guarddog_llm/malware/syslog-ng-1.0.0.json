During installation, it collects sensitive information from the system, including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then exfiltrates this data by sending it via an HTTP GET request to an external domain (fo7288ar9hjgo6tp8p6c1efxpovgja7z.oastify.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band data collection and is not a legitimate service endpoint. This behavior is a clear indicator of malicious intent, as it attempts to stealthily collect and transmit potentially sensitive information from the user's environment without consent.",
