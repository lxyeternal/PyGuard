The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed during installation. This is a classic technique used by malware to hide its true behavior from static analysis and to execute arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine. The use of exec() on decrypted data, especially in a package installation context, is highly suspicious and is a common method for delivering and executing malicious payloads. The obfuscated class and variable names, as well as the nonsensical metadata, further indicate an attempt to evade detection and analysis.",
