The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe', then runs it. This is a classic technique for delivering and executing malware on a victim's machine. The check for the existence of the 'tahg' file is likely used as a simple persistence or anti-redundancy mechanism. The use of obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell and silent execution are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
