After the standard setuptools setup, it creates a temporary file containing Python code that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/39kv9/raw) using urllib and exec. It then attempts to launch a new Python process (using the Windows executable, with a suspicious replacement of '.exe' to 'w.exe', likely to evade detection or run with a different interpreter) to execute this temporary file. This is a classic pattern for remote code execution and is often used in supply chain attacks via malicious PyPI packages.",
