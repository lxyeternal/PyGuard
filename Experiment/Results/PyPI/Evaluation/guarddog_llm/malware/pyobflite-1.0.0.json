This is a classic pattern for remote code execution, which can be used to run arbitrary and potentially harmful code on the victim's machine. Additionally, the function send_discord_info is misleadingly named, as it does not send information to Discord but instead downloads and executes remote code. The mass installation of various Python packages, some of which are commonly used in information stealing (e.g., browser_cookie3, discord_webhook, pyautogui, winregistry), further increases the risk and suggests preparation for malicious activity such as credential theft, system manipulation, or exfiltration of sensitive data.",
