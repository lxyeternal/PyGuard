If so, it proceeds to: (1) create a directory in the user's TEMP folder, (2) write a Python file (main.cpython-39.pyw) and a VBScript file (main.scripts.cpython-39.vbs) to that directory, (3) the VBScript is base64-decoded and contains code to execute a Python script (main.cpython-39.pyw) using wscript, and (4) the VBScript is then executed via Popen with shell=True. This is a classic technique for achieving code execution on a victim's machine during package installation, often used in supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscated payloads (base64), writing to TEMP, and launching via VBScript are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
