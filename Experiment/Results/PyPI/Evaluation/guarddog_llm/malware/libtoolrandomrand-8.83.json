The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe', then runs it and attempts to execute another file 'WindowsCache.exe'. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, often used to deliver malware to a victim's machine. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and encoded commands further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
