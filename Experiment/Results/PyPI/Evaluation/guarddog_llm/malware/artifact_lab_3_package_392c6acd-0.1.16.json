It connects to a remote host (6.tcp.eu.ngrok.io) and port (19048) using a TCP socket, then redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to this socket. It then spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i), effectively giving the remote host control over the system's shell. This is a common technique used by attackers to gain unauthorized remote access to a compromised machine. The use of an external host and port, combined with shell execution and stream redirection, is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
