The payload is not visible in the source code, making its behavior intentionally obfuscated and hidden from static analysis. This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and deliver a second-stage payload at install time. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and almost always indicative of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation.",
