The command is only run if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150599404/Esquele.exe) and then runs it, likely as a form of malware delivery. This behavior is highly indicative of a trojan or dropper, as it attempts to fetch and execute a potentially malicious executable from the internet without user consent.",
