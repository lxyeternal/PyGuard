The command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is classic downloader/backdoor behavior, often used to infect systems with malware. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and EncodedCommand is a common technique to evade detection. The code is also obfuscated and attempts to run only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a simple persistence or anti-analysis check.",
