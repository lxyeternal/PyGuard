When the script is run with the argument 'install', it writes this payload to a randomly-named .exe file in the system temporary directory and then executes it using subprocess.Popen with shell=True and a specific creation flag (0x08000000, which is CREATE_NO_WINDOW on Windows). This is a classic dropper technique: the Python script acts as a loader for a hidden binary payload, which is then executed on the victim's machine. The rest of the code is a decoy setup script for a legitimate-looking Python package, likely to disguise the malicious intent. This is not a false positive; the code is designed to deliver and execute a hidden binary payload.",
