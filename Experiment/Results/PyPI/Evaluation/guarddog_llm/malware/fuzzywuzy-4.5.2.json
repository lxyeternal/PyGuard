(2) It downloads a Windows executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and executes it using os.system('start '+filename). This is a classic technique for delivering and running additional malware on the victim's machine. (3) The malicious actions are triggered automatically after package installation by hooking into the setuptools install command via the PostInstallCommand class and the cmdclass argument in setup(). This ensures the payload runs as soon as the package is installed, without user knowledge.",
