      "false_positive_reason": "The code is obfuscated using exec and chr/map to hide its real content, which is a common technique in malicious code, but not inherently malicious. Upon deobfuscation, the code is a typical Python package setup script (setup.py) for a package named 'ultraobfuscator'. It includes standard imports, pip install commands for dependencies, and a function to clone a GitHub repository if a local directory does not exist. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or other malicious payloads. The obfuscation is likely used to deter reverse engineering or casual inspection, not to hide malicious intent. The security tool flagged it due to the use of exec and obfuscation, which are suspicious patterns, but in this context, the code is not malicious.",
