It then launches this file using a modified Python executable name (replacing .exe with w.exe), which is a common evasion technique. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper, which can be used to execute arbitrary code from the internet without user consent. Such actions are highly indicative of malicious intent, as they allow remote code execution and can compromise the system.",
