The payload is not visible in the source code, making its behavior intentionally hidden and obfuscated. This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and analysis. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This behavior is not typical or necessary for legitimate Python packages and is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
