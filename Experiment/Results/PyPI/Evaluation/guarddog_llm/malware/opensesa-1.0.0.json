The encrypted payload is not visible in the source, making it impossible to determine its intent without decryption, but this is a common technique used to hide malicious actions such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or other unauthorized activities. The use of exec() on decrypted code, especially in a package installation context, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. Additionally, the obfuscated class name and nonsensical metadata further suggest an attempt to evade detection.",
