The PowerShell command is encoded and hidden from the user (using -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand), which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary or harmful commands on the system. This behavior is not typical or necessary for a legitimate Python package setup script and is a strong indicator of malicious intent, such as downloading and executing further payloads or establishing persistence.",
