The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), and the URL within the decoded payload (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) suggests it is attempting to download and execute a file from a remote server. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, especially as it tries to hide the PowerShell window and execute code without user knowledge.",
