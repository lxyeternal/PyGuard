Decoding this payload reveals that it attempts to: (1) check for the existence of specific Windows directories, (2) create directories and files in the user's AppData path, (3) write and execute VBScript and batch files, (4) download and run a file from a remote server (http://51.77.140.144:8086/dl/runtime), and (5) use subprocess to execute these scripts. This is classic malware dropper behavior, attempting to persist and execute remote code on the victim's machine. The obfuscation (base64 encoding and exec) is a strong indicator of intent to hide malicious actions.",
