      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a credential and information stealer, commonly referred to as a 'stealer' malware. It performs the following malicious actions: (1) Extracts Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data from the victim's machine by searching browser and application directories. (2) Decrypts stored credentials using Windows APIs and the browser's master key. (3) Collects additional files of interest (such as those containing keywords like 'password', 'wallet', 'crypto', etc.) from the user's Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders. (4) Zips and uploads stolen files to external file hosting services. (5) Exfiltrates all collected data, including credentials, cookies, tokens, and file links, to a hardcoded Discord webhook (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1133180253678862436/6AG7x4Z5uUZoCkaEqUfq03A087OCbcK1-vflpxnZCOmKs0jipMsjmYdUs2-4q6jtfHHb). (6) Attempts to kill processes of certain applications (e.g., browsers, Telegram, Steam) to access their files. (7) Gathers geolocation and IP information about the victim. The code is heavily focused on stealing as much sensitive information as possible and sending it to an attacker-controlled server.",
