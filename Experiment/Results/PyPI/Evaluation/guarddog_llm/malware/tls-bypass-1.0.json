It then attempts to execute this script using a modified Python executable name (replacing .exe with w.exe), which is a common evasion technique. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper, which can be used to execute arbitrary code from the internet on the victim's machine. This is a clear example of malicious behavior, as it allows remote code execution without user consent.",
