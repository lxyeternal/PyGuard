The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string and is executed via exec(). This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and execution during install strongly indicates malicious intent, such as installing a backdoor, stealing information, or downloading further malware.",
