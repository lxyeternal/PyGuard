The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest, saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and then running it. This is a classic technique for downloading and executing potentially malicious binaries on a victim's machine without their knowledge. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW further attempts to hide the execution from the user. The presence of a decoy setup() call and misleading package metadata is also a common tactic in malicious Python packages.",
