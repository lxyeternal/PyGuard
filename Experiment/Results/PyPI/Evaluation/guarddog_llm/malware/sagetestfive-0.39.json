      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It abuses the Python package installation process by defining a custom install command that executes arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Specifically, it: (1) creates directories in the Windows Startup folder, (2) clones two remote GitHub repositories into these folders, (3) moves a Python file into the Startup folder to ensure it runs on system startup (persistence), and (4) executes a downloaded executable (main.exe) from one of the cloned repositories. This behavior is typical of malware that seeks to establish persistence and execute potentially harmful payloads on the victim's machine. The use of misleading folder names (e.g., 'Powerpoint', 'boot') and the execution of remote code further confirm the malicious intent.",
