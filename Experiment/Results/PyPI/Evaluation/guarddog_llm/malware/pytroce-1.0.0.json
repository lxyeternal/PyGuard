The encrypted payload is not visible in the code, making its intent and actions opaque, but this pattern is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code (such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or other malware) during package installation. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution. The package metadata (name, author, description) is also nonsensical, which is a common trait of malicious or obfuscated packages.",
