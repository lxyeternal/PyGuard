This is a common technique used by malware to hide its activity and execute potentially harmful commands without user visibility. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it, all while hiding the window. This behavior is indicative of a downloader or dropper, which is a classic malware pattern.",
