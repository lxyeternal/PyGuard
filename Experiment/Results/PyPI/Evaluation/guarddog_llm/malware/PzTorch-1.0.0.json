The payload is not visible in plaintext, making its intent and actions deliberately hidden from inspection. This is a common technique used by malware to evade static analysis and deliver malicious code at install time. The use of exec() on decrypted data, especially in a package installation context, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.",
