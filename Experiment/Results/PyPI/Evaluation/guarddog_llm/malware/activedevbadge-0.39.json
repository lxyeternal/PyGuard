During the installation process (via a custom install command in setup.py), it creates directories in the Windows Startup folder, clones two remote GitHub repositories (one named 'test2lmaos' and another named 'defonotagrabber'), moves a Python file into the Startup directory, and executes a binary ('main.exe') from the cloned repository. This ensures that arbitrary code from the remote repositories is executed on the victim's machine and persists by running at startup. The repository name 'defonotagrabber' is also a strong indicator of credential or data theft intent. These actions are not typical or legitimate for a Python package installation and are designed to compromise the user's system.",
