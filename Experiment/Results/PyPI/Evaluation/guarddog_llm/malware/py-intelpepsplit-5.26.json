The encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from 'https://esquelesquad.000webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquad.exe' and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a common malware technique. The use of a hidden window, encoded command, and remote download strongly indicates malicious intent.",
