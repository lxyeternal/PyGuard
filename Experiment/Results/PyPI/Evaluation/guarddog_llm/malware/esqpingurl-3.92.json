This is a common technique used by malware to hide its activity and execute potentially harmful commands or download and run additional payloads from the internet. The encoded command, when decoded, appears to invoke a web request to 'http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0' and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then attempts to execute it. This behavior is consistent with a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that downloads and executes further malicious code.",
