The command downloads and executes a file from a remote URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as WindowsCache.exe, then invokes it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and execute additional malicious payloads. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand is a known technique to evade detection and hide execution from the user. The code is also obfuscated by checking for the existence of a file ('tahg') before executing, and is wrapped in a try/except to suppress errors.",
