      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), and it downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, often used to deliver malware. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' and 'subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW' further indicates an attempt to hide execution from the user.",
