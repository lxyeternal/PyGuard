The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. The command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior is consistent with a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and executes additional malicious payloads. The rest of the code is a decoy setup.py for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious intent.",
