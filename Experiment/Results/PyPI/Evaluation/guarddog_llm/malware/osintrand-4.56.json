      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. The URL 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0' is present in the decoded command, indicating that it downloads and likely executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from Dropbox. This behavior is consistent with a downloader or dropper, which is a typical first stage in malware infection chains. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' further indicates an attempt to hide the execution from the user.",
