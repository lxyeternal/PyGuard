The CustomInstallCommand class in the setup.py file overrides the install command to execute a large, obfuscated payload during package installation. Specifically, it contains a long, encoded string (wopvEaTEcopFEavc) and a key (iOpvEoeaaeavocp), which are used to XOR-decode a hidden Python script. The decoded script is then executed using eval(compile(...)), which allows arbitrary code execution on the system where the package is installed. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious payloads in Python packages, and it can be used to perform a wide range of attacks, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or further malware installation.",
