It uses base64 encoding to hide its true intent, then decodes and executes the payload at runtime using built-in functions (compile, exec). The decoded payload imports modules for file and system operations, downloads and executes code from a remote server (http://20.126.118.208/inject/89ruK8S9QUt74L69), and attempts to execute a downloaded file. This is a classic example of a remote code execution backdoor, which can be used to compromise the system, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.",
