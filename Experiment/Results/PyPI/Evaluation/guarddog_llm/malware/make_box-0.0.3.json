Specifically, it fetches the remote code, writes it to a file in a location that mimics a legitimate Python package directory, and then executes it using exec(). This behavior is a classic pattern for remote code execution (RCE) and is commonly used in malware to fetch and run arbitrary code controlled by an attacker. The use of threading to perform these actions in the background further obfuscates the intent and execution flow. The code does not validate or inspect the downloaded content, making it highly dangerous.",
