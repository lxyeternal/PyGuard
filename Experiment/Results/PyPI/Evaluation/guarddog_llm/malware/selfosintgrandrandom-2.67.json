The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded, but decoding it reveals that it downloads and executes a file from a remote URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is classic dropper/backdoor behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and execute additional payloads from the internet without user consent. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW is intended to hide the execution from the user.",
