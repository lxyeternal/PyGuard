      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. The URL 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0' is present in the decoded command, indicating that it downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from Dropbox, saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory and then executing it. This is classic dropper behavior, where a Python script is used to fetch and run a malicious executable. The use of a hidden PowerShell window and encoded command further confirms the intent to hide malicious activity from the user.",
