It then encodes this information as JSON, converts it to hex, splits it into chunks, and exfiltrates it via DNS queries to a domain controlled by the package author (for-research.ru). This exfiltration is triggered automatically during install, develop, and egg_info commands, meaning it will run on any system where the package is installed or built, without user consent. This is a classic data exfiltration technique often used in malicious Python packages to steal information from victim machines.",
