This is a common technique used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user visibility. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150594048/Esquele.exe) and runs it with hidden window and suppressed output. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, such as a trojan downloader or dropper.",
