The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed during installation. This is a classic technique used to hide malicious payloads from static analysis and to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows the attacker to run any code they choose on the target system.",
