The decoded payload downloads and executes code from a remote server (http://54.167.173.26/inject/i09xHUvmQ245P8bK) using Python's urllib.request.urlopen and exec. This is a classic pattern for remote code execution (RCE) and is a severe security risk. The use of temp files and attempts to hide execution further indicate malicious intent.",
