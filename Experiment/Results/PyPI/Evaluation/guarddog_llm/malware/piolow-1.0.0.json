The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This is a common technique used by malware to hide and execute harmful code, such as stealing data, installing backdoors, or downloading further payloads. The use of non-descriptive variable names and suspicious author information further supports the assessment that this package is malicious.",
