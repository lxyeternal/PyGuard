      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated, but it downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is classic downloader/backdoor behavior, often used to infect systems with additional malware. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flags is intended to hide the execution from the user, further indicating malicious intent.",
