The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This is a common technique used by malware to hide and execute harmful code, such as downloading additional payloads, stealing data, or compromising the system. The obfuscated class and variable names, as well as the suspicious author information, further support the assessment that this package is designed to perform malicious actions.",
