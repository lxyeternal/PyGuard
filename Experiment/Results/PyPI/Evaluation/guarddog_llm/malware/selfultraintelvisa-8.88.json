The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), and the URL within the decoded payload (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) suggests it is downloading and executing a file from a remote source. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, often used to download and run additional malicious payloads on the victim's machine. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates an attempt to hide the execution from the user.",
