The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), and it downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) using Invoke-WebRequest, saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then executing it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a common initial stage in malware infections. The use of hidden execution, obfuscation, and remote code retrieval are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
