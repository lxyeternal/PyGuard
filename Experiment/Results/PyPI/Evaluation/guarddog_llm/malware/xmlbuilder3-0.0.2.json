In its run() method, after performing the normal installation, it executes a subprocess that runs a module (poc_nvk.my_module) using the current Python interpreter. This is a classic technique used in dependency confusion and supply chain attacks, where arbitrary code can be executed on the system during package installation. The description and naming ('DEPEndency C0nfusion P0C') further suggest this is a proof-of-concept for such an attack. The code does not check or inform the user about this extra execution, making it potentially dangerous.",
