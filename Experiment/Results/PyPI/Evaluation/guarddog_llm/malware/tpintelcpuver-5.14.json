The command is run only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common anti-analysis or persistence technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, making its intent deliberately obfuscated. The URL 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0' is present in the decoded command, indicating that it downloads and likely executes a file from Dropbox, which is a common method for delivering malware. The use of '-WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' further indicates an attempt to hide execution from the user. The code is not related to the stated package functionality and is clearly a malicious dropper.",
