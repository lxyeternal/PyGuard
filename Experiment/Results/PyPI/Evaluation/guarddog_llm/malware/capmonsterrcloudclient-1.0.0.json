The decryption key and encrypted data are hardcoded. The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This is a common technique used by malware to hide and execute malicious code, such as downloading additional payloads, stealing data, or creating backdoors. The use of obfuscated metadata (random-looking author, description, etc.) further suggests an attempt to evade detection.",
