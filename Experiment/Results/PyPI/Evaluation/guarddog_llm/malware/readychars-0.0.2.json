It uses obfuscation by base64-encoding a large payload, which is then decoded and executed at runtime using Python's exec and compile functions. The decoded payload downloads and executes additional code from a remote server (http://193.42.33.24/inject/1zGPvS8IX5cz9sSH and http://193.42.33.24/clip), writes the downloaded content to temporary files, and attempts to execute them as processes. This is classic behavior for a dropper or loader malware, which can be used to deliver further malicious payloads to the victim's machine. The use of obfuscation, remote code download, and execution are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
