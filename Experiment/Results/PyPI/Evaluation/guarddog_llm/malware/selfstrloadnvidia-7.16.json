This is a common technique used by malware to hide its activity and execute potentially harmful commands or download and run additional payloads. The encoded command appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and save it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then execute it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, as it downloads and runs an executable from the internet without user consent, and attempts to hide its window.",
