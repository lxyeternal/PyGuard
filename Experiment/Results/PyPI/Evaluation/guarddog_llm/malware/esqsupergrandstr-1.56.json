The encoded command (Base64) decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/103168717423501312/1079749475150594048/Esquele.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and execute additional payloads from the internet. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and the check for a non-existent file ('tahg') are further indicators of an attempt to evade detection and persist on the system.",
