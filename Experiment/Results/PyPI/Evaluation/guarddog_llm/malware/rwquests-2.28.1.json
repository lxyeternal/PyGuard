This is classic dropper behavior, where arbitrary code is fetched and executed from an external, potentially malicious source. Furthermore, the code is designed to execute this behavior every time any of the HTTP request wrapper functions (get, post, put, patch, delete, head, options, request) are called, making it highly likely to be used for persistence or to evade detection. The use of a hardcoded IP address and the lack of any validation or user interaction further indicate malicious intent.",
