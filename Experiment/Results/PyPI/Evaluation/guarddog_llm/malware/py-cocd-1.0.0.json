During installation, if the OS is Windows, it imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet. The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of exec on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the target system during package installation. This is a common technique used in supply chain attacks to deliver malware.",
