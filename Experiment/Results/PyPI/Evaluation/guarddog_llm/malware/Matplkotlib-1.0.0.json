The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed during installation. This is a classic technique used by malware to hide its true behavior and evade static analysis. The use of exec() on decrypted code, especially in a package masquerading as a popular library ('Matplkotlib' is a typo of 'matplotlib'), is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code could perform any number of harmful actions, such as data exfiltration, backdoor installation, or system compromise, and the obfuscation is designed to hide this from casual inspection.",
