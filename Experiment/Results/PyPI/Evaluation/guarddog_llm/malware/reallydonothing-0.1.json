During the installation process (via a custom install command), it searches the /Library/Application Support directory for paths matching a specific pattern. For each matching path, it generates a hash and compares it to a hardcoded value. If a match is found, it downloads an encrypted binary from a remote server (with the URL obfuscated via XOR and a custom PRNG), decrypts it, writes it to the user's ~/.local/bin directory, sets it as executable, and then executes it in a subprocess. This is classic behavior for a second-stage malware dropper or loader. The use of obfuscated URLs, custom decryption, and execution of a downloaded binary during package installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
