The PowerShell command is run with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand', which are common techniques used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary or potentially harmful commands without user knowledge. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and runs additional malicious payloads.",
