The PowerShell command is encoded and appears to download and execute a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and then runs it as a process (WindowsCache.exe). This is a classic technique for downloading and executing remote malware, and the use of -WindowStyle Hidden and EncodedCommand are common evasion tactics. The code is clearly designed to run arbitrary code from the internet without user consent, which is highly malicious.",
