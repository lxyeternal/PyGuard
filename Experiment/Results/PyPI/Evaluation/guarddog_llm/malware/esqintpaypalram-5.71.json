      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command downloads and executes a file from a remote URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then invokes it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, often used to deliver malware. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand are common techniques to evade detection and hide execution from the user. The code only runs this payload if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a simple persistence or anti-redundancy check. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call for a fake Python package.",
