The PowerShell command is run with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which hides the window, and the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is commonly used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, often used in malware to fetch and run additional payloads. The use of obfuscation, remote code execution, and persistence checks (file existence) are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
