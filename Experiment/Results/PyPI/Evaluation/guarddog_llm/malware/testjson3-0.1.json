In the run() method of CustomCommand, it imports a function 'main' from a module 'testjsonn1' and calls it with a URL pointing to a remote Python script hosted on Discord's CDN and a filename 'testnp.py'. This pattern is highly suspicious: it downloads and likely executes code from an external, non-trusted source during installation, which is a common technique used in supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. This behavior can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine without their knowledge or consent.",
