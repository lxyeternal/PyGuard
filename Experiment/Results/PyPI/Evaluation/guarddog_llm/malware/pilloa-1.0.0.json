It defines a custom install command (GruppeInstall) that, when the package is installed on a Windows system, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload via exec(). The payload is not visible in plaintext, which is a common technique to hide malicious actions such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or other harmful operations. The use of exec() on decrypted data during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge.",
