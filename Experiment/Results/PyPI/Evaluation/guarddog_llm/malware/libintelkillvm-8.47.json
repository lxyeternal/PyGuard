The payload decodes to a command that downloads and executes a file from a remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe', then runs it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, often used to deliver malware. The check for the existence of the 'tahg' file is likely an anti-redundancy or anti-analysis measure. The rest of the code is a decoy setup.py for a Python package, which is a common technique for hiding malicious code in seemingly legitimate packages.",
