This function collects sensitive system information, including system uptime, OS details, platform, and the host's IP address. It then establishes a socket connection to the external IP address 134.209.85.64 on port 80 and exfiltrates the collected data. This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration and is commonly associated with malicious software, as it sends potentially sensitive information to an external server without user consent.",
