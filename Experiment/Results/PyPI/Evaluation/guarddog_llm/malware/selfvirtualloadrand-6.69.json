The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, often used to deliver malware. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates an attempt to hide execution from the user.",
