The command is run with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which hides the PowerShell window from the user. The encoded command (Base64) decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a classic example of a downloader/dropper, which is a common malware technique. The code is obfuscated and attempts to evade detection by hiding the window and encoding the payload.",
