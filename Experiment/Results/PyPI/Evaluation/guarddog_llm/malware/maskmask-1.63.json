The PowerShell command is run with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which hides the window, and the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is commonly used to obfuscate the actual command being run. This is a classic technique used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user knowledge. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and conditional logic to avoid repeated execution are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
