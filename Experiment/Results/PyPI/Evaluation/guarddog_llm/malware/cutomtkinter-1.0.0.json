The payload is not visible in plaintext, making its intent and actions deliberately obfuscated. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its true behavior and evade static analysis. Executing arbitrary, hidden code during package installation is a hallmark of malicious Python packages, especially those masquerading as legitimate libraries (note the typo in 'cutomtkinter'). The use of exec on decrypted data is highly suspicious and dangerous.",
