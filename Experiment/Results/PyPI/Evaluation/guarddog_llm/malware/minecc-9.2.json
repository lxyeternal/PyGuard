The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common technique for executing obfuscated or hidden commands, often used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user knowledge. The encoded command appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbuqmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then attempts to execute it. This behavior is consistent with a downloader or dropper, which is a typical first stage in malware infection chains.",
