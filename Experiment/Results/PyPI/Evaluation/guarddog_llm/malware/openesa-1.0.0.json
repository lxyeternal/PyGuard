The encrypted payload is not visible in the source, making it impossible to determine its intent without decryption, but this is a common technique used to hide malicious code (such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or remote code execution) from static analysis and security tools. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The obfuscated class name and nonsensical metadata further suggest an attempt to evade detection.",
