      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs several actions that are characteristic of malware: (1) It checks if the current user is not 'Tahg', likely to avoid infecting the developer's own machine. (2) It constructs a path in the user's TEMP directory for a file named 'temp-PipInstall.exe'. (3) It adds a registry entry under 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce' to ensure that the downloaded executable will run on the next user login, achieving persistence. (4) It downloads an executable ('esqueleDrp.exe') from a remote Dropbox URL using curl and saves it to the constructed path. (5) It executes the downloaded file. These behaviors—downloading and executing a remote binary, establishing persistence, and evading the developer's own environment—are all strong indicators of malicious intent, specifically for delivering and running a Windows-based stealer or similar malware.",
