It performs the following malicious actions: (1) It exfiltrates the current user's login name to a remote server using an HTTP GET request. (2) It establishes a reverse shell by connecting to a hardcoded IP address (194.233.164.169) and port (1337), then redirects the standard input/output/error to this socket, and spawns a shell using pty.spawn('sh'). This gives the remote attacker full shell access to the victim's machine as the user who installed the package. These are classic indicators of a malicious Python package designed to compromise systems via supply chain attacks.",
