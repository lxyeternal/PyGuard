The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making its intent and actions hidden from static analysis. This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it allows for arbitrary code execution. The package metadata is also obfuscated and nonsensical, further indicating malicious intent.",
