The use of threading to execute this in the background, the use of a pastebin-like service to dynamically control the payload, and the execution of a downloaded binary are all strong indicators of a dropper or loader commonly used in malware. The code does not perform any validation or user notification, and the remote content can be changed at any time to deliver arbitrary payloads.",
