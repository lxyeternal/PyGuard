This is a standard and common practice in Python build scripts (such as setup.py) to dynamically determine build options based on the system's configuration. The subprocess call does not execute arbitrary user input or download/execute remote code, and its arguments are hardcoded or controlled by environment variables typically set by the build environment. There is no evidence of code execution vulnerabilities, data exfiltration, or other malicious intent. The security tool likely flagged this due to the generic use of subprocess, but in this context, it is benign and expected.",
