The encoded command (base64) is obfuscated and is executed in a hidden window (using -WindowStyle Hidden and subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download or execute additional payloads without user knowledge. The check for the existence of a file named 'tahg' is likely used as a persistence or execution guard. The rest of the code is a decoy (setup.py for a Python package). The presence of a suspicious comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of a ProtonMail address further suggest malicious intent.",
