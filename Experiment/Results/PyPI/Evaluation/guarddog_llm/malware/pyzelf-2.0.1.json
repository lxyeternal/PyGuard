Decoding the payload reveals that it attempts to: (1) check for the existence of a specific path in the user's AppData directory, (2) create directories and write files in that location, (3) download and execute a remote binary (build_1.exe) from a Discord CDN link, and (4) run additional commands using subprocess. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, as it attempts to download and execute external code on the victim's machine without their consent, and uses obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide its true intent.",
