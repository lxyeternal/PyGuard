The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a common form of malware. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and EncodedCommand is a known technique to evade detection and hide execution from the user.",
