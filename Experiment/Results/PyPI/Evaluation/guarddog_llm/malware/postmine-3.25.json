The PowerShell command is encoded and, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic technique for delivering and executing malware on a victim's machine. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and EncodedCommand are common evasion tactics to avoid detection.",
