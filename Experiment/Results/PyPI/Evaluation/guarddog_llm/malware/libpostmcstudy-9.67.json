      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded as: 'SQBuAHYAbwBrAGUALQBXAGUAYgBSAGUAcQB1AGUAcwB0ACAALQBVAHIAaQAgACIAaAB0AHQAcABzADoALwAv...'. Decoding this reveals that it downloads and executes a file from a remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe', then runs it. This is a classic dropper/downloader behavior, often used to infect systems with malware. The use of '-WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' further indicates an attempt to hide the execution from the user.",
