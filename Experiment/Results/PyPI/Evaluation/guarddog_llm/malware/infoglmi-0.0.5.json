It also writes a suspicious configuration file to /tmp/config.json, which appears to configure a cryptocurrency miner (notably, it references 'nicehash' and a mining pool address). The code then changes the permissions of the downloaded binary to make it executable and executes it. This behavior is typical of cryptomining malware, which covertly installs and runs mining software on a victim's machine. The use of system calls to execute an untrusted binary from the internet is highly dangerous and malicious.",
