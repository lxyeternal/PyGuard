It performs the following malicious actions: (1) Extracts saved passwords and cookies from Google Chrome by accessing and decrypting the browser's local storage; (2) Searches for Discord authentication tokens in various installed applications and verifies them by making requests to Discord's API; (3) Takes a screenshot of the victim's desktop; (4) Collects the victim's public IP address and geolocation data via ipinfo.io; (5) Packages all stolen data into a zip file; (6) Exfiltrates the stolen data and screenshot to a hardcoded Discord webhook controlled by the attacker; (7) Attempts to kill Discord processes and injects malicious code into Discord's local files to maintain persistence or further compromise. All of these behaviors are characteristic of information-stealing malware.",
