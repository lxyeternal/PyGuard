During installation (install, develop, or egg_info commands), it collects sensitive information from the victim's machine, including the hostname, current username, and current working directory. It then encodes this data as hex, splits it into chunks, and sends it out as part of DNS queries to a domain controlled by the attacker (uchpuchmak.lol). This allows the attacker to receive information about every machine where the package is installed, without the user's knowledge or consent. This is a classic example of a dependency confusion attack, where a malicious package is uploaded to a public repository with the intent to be installed in place of a private/internal package.",
