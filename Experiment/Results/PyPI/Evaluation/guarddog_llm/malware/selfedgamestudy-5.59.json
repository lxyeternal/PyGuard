      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, making it difficult to immediately see its intent, but this is a typical method used by malware to download or execute further payloads from the internet. The use of '-WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' ensures the command runs without alerting the user. The URL in the encoded command (esquelesquad.000webhostapp.com/xEsqueleSquad.exe) suggests it is downloading and executing a potentially malicious executable. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, specifically a downloader or dropper.",
