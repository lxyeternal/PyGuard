The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common technique for executing obfuscated or hidden commands, often used in malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user knowledge. The encoded command appears to download and execute a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent (downloading and running executables from the internet). This behavior is not consistent with legitimate package setup scripts and is a clear sign of malware.",
