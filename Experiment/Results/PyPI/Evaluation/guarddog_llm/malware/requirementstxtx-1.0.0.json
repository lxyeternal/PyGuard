The payload is not visible in plaintext, making its intent and actions deliberately obfuscated. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its true behavior and evade detection. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This is a clear indicator of malicious behavior, as it can be used to download and execute further malware, steal information, or compromise the system.",
