The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote URL (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and executes additional malicious payloads from the internet. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
