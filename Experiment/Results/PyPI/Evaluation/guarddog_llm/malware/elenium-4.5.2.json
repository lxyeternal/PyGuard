(2) On Windows systems, it downloads an executable file (python-install.scr) from an external site (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and then executes it using os.system('start '+filename). This is a classic method for delivering and executing a second-stage payload, which could be malware. (3) The malicious logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command (PostInstallCommand), ensuring the payload is executed automatically when the package is installed (e.g., via pip). This is a common technique for supply chain attacks in Python packages.",
