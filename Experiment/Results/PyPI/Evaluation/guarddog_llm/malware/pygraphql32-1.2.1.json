The setup() function uses this class in the cmdclass argument, but there is no evidence of code execution, file modification, network activity, or other malicious actions. The dependencies listed (requests, pyautogui, pycryptodome, pywin32-ctypes, psutil) are legitimate Python packages, though some (like pyautogui and pycryptodome) could be used in malicious packages, their presence alone is not sufficient to label this code as malicious. The detection tool likely flagged this due to the use of a custom install command, which is a common technique in malicious packages, but in this case, the custom command does nothing extra.",
