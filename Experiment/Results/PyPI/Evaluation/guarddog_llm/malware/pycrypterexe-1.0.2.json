It defines a custom installation command (InstallCommand) that, when the package is installed (e.g., via pip), downloads a remote Python script (WindowsUpdate.py) from a GitHub repository and executes it using subprocess with shell=True. This allows arbitrary code execution from an external, potentially untrusted source, which is a classic technique for delivering malware or backdoors. The script is then deleted to cover its tracks. The package is also named and described as a 'Python File Crypter FUD', which is a term commonly associated with malware designed to evade detection.",
