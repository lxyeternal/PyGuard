The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated, but the use of -EncodedCommand and -WindowStyle Hidden is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and run commands without user visibility. The URL 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0' is present in the decoded payload, indicating that the script is attempting to download and execute a remote executable file, which is a clear sign of malicious intent. The rest of the code is a decoy setup.py for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious behavior.",
