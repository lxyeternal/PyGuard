This behavior is triggered every time any of the HTTP request wrapper functions (get, post, put, patch, delete, head, options, request) are called. This is a classic pattern for a dropper or loader, which is a type of malware that fetches and runs additional malicious payloads from a remote server. The use of a hardcoded IP address, the lack of any validation or user interaction, and the automatic execution of downloaded binaries are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
