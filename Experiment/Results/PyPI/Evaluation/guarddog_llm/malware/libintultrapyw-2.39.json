The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150599404/Esquele.exe) and then runs it, hiding the window. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, often used to infect the system with additional malicious payloads. The use of a try/except block to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and ensure execution.",
