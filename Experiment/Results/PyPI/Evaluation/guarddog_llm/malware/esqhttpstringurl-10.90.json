The encoded command, when decoded from Base64, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote URL (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150594048/Esquele.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This is a classic technique used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' further indicates an attempt to hide the execution from the user. The check for the existence of the 'tahg' file is likely used as a simple persistence or anti-redundancy mechanism.",
