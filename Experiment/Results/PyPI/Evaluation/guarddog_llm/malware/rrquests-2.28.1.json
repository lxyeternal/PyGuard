It then sets execute permissions (on Linux/macOS) and runs the executables in the background, or starts them on Windows. This is classic dropper/backdoor behavior, as it allows the remote server to deliver and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. Furthermore, the code is disguised as a wrapper around the requests library, so any use of the HTTP methods (get, post, etc.) will trigger the malicious payload, making it stealthy and dangerous.",
