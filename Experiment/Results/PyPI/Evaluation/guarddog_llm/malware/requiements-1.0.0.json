The code imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' (from the cryptography package), then decrypts and executes a block of encrypted Python code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is not visible in plaintext, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true behavior from static analysis. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The package name 'requiements' is also a common typo-squatting technique to trick users into installing it instead of 'requirements'.",
