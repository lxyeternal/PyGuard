The command is run only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common technique to avoid repeated execution. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a typical obfuscation method used by malware to evade detection. The decoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to run it. This is clear evidence of a downloader/dropper behavior, which is a hallmark of malware.",
