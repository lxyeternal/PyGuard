The encrypted payload is not visible in the source, making it impossible to determine its intent without decryption, but this is a common technique used to hide malicious actions such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or other unauthorized activities. The use of exec() on decrypted code, especially in a package installation context, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. Additionally, the package metadata (name, author, description) appears randomly generated, which is another red flag for malware or supply chain attacks.",
