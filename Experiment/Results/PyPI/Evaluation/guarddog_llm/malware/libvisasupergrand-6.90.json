The command is only run if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe', then runs it and deletes the executable. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, often used to deliver malware. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates an attempt to hide execution from the user.",
