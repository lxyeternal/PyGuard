Specifically, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload via exec(). The payload is not visible in plaintext, but this pattern is a classic method for hiding and executing malicious code (such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or other attacks) during package installation. The use of an obfuscated class name, suspicious metadata, and the requirement for 'fernet' and 'requests' (which are not needed for normal setup.py operations) further indicate malicious intent.",
