The payload is stored as a long, XOR-encoded string (wopvEaTEcopFEavc) and a key (iOpvEoeaaeavocp). The code decodes the payload and then executes it using eval(compile(..., 'exec')), which allows arbitrary code execution on the system where the package is installed. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code in Python packages, and is highly suspicious and dangerous. The use of try/except to silently ignore errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
