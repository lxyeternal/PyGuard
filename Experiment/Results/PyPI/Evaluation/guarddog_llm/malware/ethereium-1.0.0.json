During installation (specifically on Windows systems), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload via exec(). This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code at install time, making detection and analysis more difficult. The use of obfuscated class names, suspicious metadata, and the execution of decrypted code are all strong indicators of malware, such as information stealers, backdoors, or other forms of remote access tools.",
