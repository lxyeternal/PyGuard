The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded, but decoding it reveals that it downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic example of a downloader/dropper, which is a common malware technique. The use of hidden execution, encoded commands, and remote payload delivery are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
