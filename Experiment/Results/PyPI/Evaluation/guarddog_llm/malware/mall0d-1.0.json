      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a highly sophisticated information stealer (infostealer) targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and cryptocurrency wallet data. It performs the following malicious actions: (1) Searches for and exfiltrates Discord tokens, browser passwords, and cookies from various browsers and Discord installations. (2) Decrypts and collects sensitive data using Windows cryptographic APIs. (3) Uploads stolen data to a Discord webhook (hardcoded in the script) and to transfer.sh, a public file sharing service. (4) Kills browser and wallet processes to access locked files. (5) Searches user directories for files containing sensitive keywords (e.g., 'password', 'wallet', 'crypto') and uploads them. (6) Installs dependencies at runtime, increasing its portability and stealth. (7) Uses threading to speed up data theft and exfiltration. (8) Attempts to evade detection by checking for Google cookies. The presence of hardcoded webhooks, targeted data theft, and exfiltration to remote servers are clear indicators of malicious intent.",
