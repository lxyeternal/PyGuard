      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command (AfterInstall) that, when the package is installed (e.g., via pip), executes the function notmalfunc(). This function decodes a base64-encoded string (currently 'CODE_REPLACE') and executes it using os.system(). This is a classic technique used in malicious Python packages to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine during installation. The placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE' would typically be replaced with a base64-encoded payload, such as a reverse shell, data exfiltration, or other harmful commands. The use of os.system() with decoded, potentially attacker-controlled input is a clear indicator of malicious intent.",
