This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malware, as it allows arbitrary code execution from an untrusted remote source without user consent. The use of the term 'ratfinal.py' (RAT commonly stands for Remote Access Trojan) further suggests malicious intent. This code can compromise the system of anyone who installs the package.",
