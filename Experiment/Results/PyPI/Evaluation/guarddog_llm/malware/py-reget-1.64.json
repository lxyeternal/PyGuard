The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), and it downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is classic dropper/backdoor behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and run additional payloads. The use of obfuscation, remote code download, and execution, as well as the attempt to hide the process window, are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
