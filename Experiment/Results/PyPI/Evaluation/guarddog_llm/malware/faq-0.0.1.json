      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains two lines (lines 14 and 15) that use base64-encoded payloads, which are decoded and executed at runtime using built-in Python functions (exec, compile, __import__). The decoded payloads download and execute code from a remote server (http://137.117.157.128/inject/...), writing the downloaded content to a temporary file and then attempting to execute it as a process. This is a classic pattern of a remote code execution backdoor, which can be used to compromise the system, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious actions. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding and dynamic execution) is a strong indicator of intent to evade detection.",
