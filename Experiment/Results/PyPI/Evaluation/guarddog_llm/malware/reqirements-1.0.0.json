The payload is not visible in the source code, making its behavior intentionally obfuscated and likely malicious. The use of exec on decrypted data is a common technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation. This behavior is highly suspicious and matches known patterns of supply chain attacks via Python packages.",
