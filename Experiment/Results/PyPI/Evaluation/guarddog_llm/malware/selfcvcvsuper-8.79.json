The encoded command (Base64) decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475145094048/Esquele.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and execute additional payloads. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and the check for a marker file ('tahg') are further indicators of malicious intent and attempts to evade detection.",
