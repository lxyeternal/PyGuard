      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, often used to deliver malware. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand are common techniques to evade detection and hide execution from the user. The check for the existence of a file named 'tahg' is likely an anti-redundancy or anti-analysis measure. The rest of the code is a decoy (setup.py for a fake package).",
