(2) On Windows systems, it downloads an executable file (python-install.scr) from an external site (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe', and then executes it using os.system('start '+filename). This is a classic technique for delivering and executing a second-stage payload, which could be malware. (3) The malicious logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command (PostInstallCommand), ensuring that the payload is executed automatically when the package is installed, which is a common technique in supply chain attacks. All these behaviors are highly indicative of a malicious Python package.",
