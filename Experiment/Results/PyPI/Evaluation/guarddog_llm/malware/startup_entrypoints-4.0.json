This function collects the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the machine, base64-encodes it, and sends it as a query parameter to a remote server (https://static-server-0300a62eb3f9.herokuapp.com/image.png). It then downloads the response and saves it as 'image.png' in the package directory. This behavior is suspicious for several reasons: (1) it exfiltrates host-identifying information to an external server without user consent, (2) it downloads and writes a file from an untrusted remote source during installation, which could be used to deliver further malicious payloads, and (3) it hides this behavior in the installation process, which is a common tactic in malicious Python packages.",
