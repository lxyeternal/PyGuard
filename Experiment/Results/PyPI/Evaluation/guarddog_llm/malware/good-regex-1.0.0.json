During installation (i.e., when pip install is run), it collects sensitive information from the user's environment, including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external domain (fo7288ar9hjgo6tp8p6c1efxpovgja7z.oastify.com), which is a known interaction/collaboration domain often used for exfiltration and testing in security research. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration and is a clear indicator of malicious intent, as it leaks potentially sensitive information without user consent.",
