It then immediately executes this file using os.system('start ' + filename). This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malware delivery, as it fetches and runs an untrusted binary from the internet without user consent or verification. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine, potentially compromising system security.",
