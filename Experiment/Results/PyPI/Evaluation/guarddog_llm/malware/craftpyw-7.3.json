The PowerShell command is encoded and is run with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which is a common technique to hide malicious activity from the user. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and runs additional malicious payloads.",
