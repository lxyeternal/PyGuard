The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded, but decoding it reveals that it downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a common form of malware. The rest of the code is a decoy (setup.py for a Python package), likely to disguise the malicious payload.",
