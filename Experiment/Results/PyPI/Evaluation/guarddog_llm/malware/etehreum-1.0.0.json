The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making its intent and actions intentionally obfuscated. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its true behavior from static analysis and evade detection. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The package name 'etehreum' is also a typosquat of 'ethereum', suggesting an attempt to trick users into installing it.",
