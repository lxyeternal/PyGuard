The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This is a common technique used by malware to hide and execute malicious code, such as stealing information, installing backdoors, or downloading further payloads. The suspicious package metadata (randomized names, emails, and descriptions) further supports the assessment that this is a malicious package.",
