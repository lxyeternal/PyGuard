      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is run only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to run it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, often used to infect systems with malware. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and EncodedCommand further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
