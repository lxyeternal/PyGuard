It performs the following malicious actions: (1) Steals Discord tokens, browser passwords, and cookies by searching browser and Discord directories, decrypting stored credentials, and collecting them. (2) Exfiltrates sensitive data (tokens, passwords, cookies, files from Desktop/Documents/Downloads, and zipped data from wallets/gaming apps) to an external attacker-controlled Discord webhook (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1052549671110848542/IJbJYSGisCyG7LPj4Seg5CGxSiA_Fo3FtrSAtgUN8pT3utKu4q9suI3Dge1yl7aNWgs4). (3) Kills processes (e.g., Telegram, Steam, wallet apps) to access files that may be locked. (4) Uploads stolen files to anonymous file sharing services and sends the links to the attacker. (5) Gathers system and geolocation information. (6) Attempts to install dependencies at runtime to ensure successful execution. The code is explicitly designed to steal and exfiltrate sensitive user data without consent.",
