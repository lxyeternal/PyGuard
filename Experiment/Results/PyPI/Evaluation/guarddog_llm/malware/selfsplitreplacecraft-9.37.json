This is a common technique used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user visibility. The encoded command, when decoded, appears to invoke a web request to a suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves the result as 'Esquele.exe', then executes it. This behavior is consistent with a downloader or dropper, which is a typical first stage in malware infection chains.",
