      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is run only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common technique to avoid repeated execution. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), and the URL 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0' is present in the decoded payload, indicating that it downloads and executes a file from Dropbox. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' further attempts to hide the execution from the user. The rest of the code is a decoy setup.py for a Python package, likely to trick users into running the file.",
