The encoded command (Base64) decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475145059404/Esquele.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and execute additional payloads from the internet. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and the check for a file named 'tahg' are further indicators of an attempt to evade detection and persist on the system.",
