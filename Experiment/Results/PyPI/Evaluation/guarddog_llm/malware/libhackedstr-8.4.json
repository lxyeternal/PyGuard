The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated and downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbuqmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then running it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a common initial stage in malware infections. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand further indicates an attempt to evade detection and hide execution from the user. The code is not related to the stated package functionality and is clearly malicious.",
