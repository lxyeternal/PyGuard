The payload is base64-encoded and, when decoded, writes a Python script to a temporary file that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://z3us.online/grab/miYOxGLuqZNlRESL). It then attempts to execute the downloaded code as a process, using either the name '.exe' or 'w.exe', depending on the environment. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a common type of malware. The use of obfuscation, remote code fetching, and execution are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
