The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its true behavior and evade static analysis. The suspiciously random class and variable names, as well as the lack of legitimate package functionality, further support the conclusion that this code is designed to perform harmful actions on the target system.",
