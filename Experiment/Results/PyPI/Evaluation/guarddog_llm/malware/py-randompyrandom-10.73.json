The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is classic dropper/backdoor behavior, often used to infect systems with malware. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and EncodedCommand further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
