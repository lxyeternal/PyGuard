The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making its behavior intentionally obfuscated and difficult to analyze statically. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its true functionality and evade detection. The use of exec() on decrypted code is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the target system during package installation. The package name 'selennuim' is also a typosquat of the popular 'selenium' package, which is a known tactic for distributing malicious packages.",
