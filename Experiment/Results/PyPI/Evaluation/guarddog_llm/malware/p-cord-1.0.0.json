The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, and is executed via exec(). This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation, making it difficult to detect the actual behavior without decrypting the payload. The use of exec() on decrypted data, especially in a setup.py install hook, is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the target system during package installation.",
