The PowerShell command is encoded and appears to download and execute additional code from a remote URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and interacts with files such as WindowsCache.exe. This is a classic technique used by malware to evade detection and download further payloads. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand are strong indicators of malicious intent, as they are commonly used to hide execution and obfuscate the payload.",
