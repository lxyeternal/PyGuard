The encoded command (base64) is obfuscated, but it downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as ~/WindowsCache.exe, then runs it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a common malware technique. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates an attempt to hide the execution from the user. The code is triggered only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common persistence or anti-analysis trick.",
