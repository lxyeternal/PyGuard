During the installation process (via a custom setuptools install command), it collects sensitive information from the host system, including the hostname, current working directory, username, IP addresses, and a list of files from root directories (such as C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then exfiltrates this data to a remote server (https://425a2.rt11.ml) via an HTTP POST request. Additionally, it attempts to resolve a DNS name constructed from encoded system information, which could be used for further exfiltration or tracking. This behavior is typical of information-stealing malware embedded in Python packages.",
