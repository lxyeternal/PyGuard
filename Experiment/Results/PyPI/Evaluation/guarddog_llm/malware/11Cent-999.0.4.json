Specifically, it gathers directory listings from '/', '/root/', '/home/', and '/root/.ssh/' (which may contain private SSH keys and other sensitive files). It then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to an external server ('https://j0j0.xyz/lists/'). This is a clear case of data exfiltration, which is a common malicious behavior. The code is triggered automatically during the package installation process, making it stealthy and dangerous.",
