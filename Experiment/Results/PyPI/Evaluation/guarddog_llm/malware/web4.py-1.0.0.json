The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its true behavior and evade static analysis. The use of obfuscated class names and suspicious metadata further supports the assessment that this code is designed to perform harmful actions on the target system.",
