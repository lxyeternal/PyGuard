It then immediately executes this file using os.system('start ' + filename). This is a classic pattern for a downloader/dropper, which is a common type of malware. The executable being downloaded and run is not verified or checked in any way, and the code is triggered automatically upon import or execution of the Python file. This behavior is highly suspicious and is often used to deliver and execute malicious payloads on the victim's machine.",
