The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed during installation. This is a classic technique for hiding malicious code from static analysis and is commonly used in supply chain attacks. The use of a misleading package name ('Matpliotlib', similar to the legitimate 'matplotlib'), random-looking author information, and the obfuscated class name further indicate an attempt to evade detection and trick users into installing a malicious package. The decrypted payload could perform any action, including data exfiltration, backdoor installation, or other harmful activities.",
