The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded, but the pattern of using 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a common technique for evading detection and running potentially harmful scripts without user visibility. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is classic downloader/dropper malware behavior.",
