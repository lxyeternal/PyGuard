The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The payload is hidden and only revealed at install time, which is a common technique for evading static analysis and delivering malware. The suspiciously random class and variable names, as well as the use of encrypted code, further support the conclusion that this package is designed to perform malicious actions upon installation.",
