      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), and it downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, as it attempts to download and run a potentially malicious executable without user consent, while hiding the PowerShell window. The use of try/except to suppress errors and the presence of a suspicious author and email further support the malicious intent.",
