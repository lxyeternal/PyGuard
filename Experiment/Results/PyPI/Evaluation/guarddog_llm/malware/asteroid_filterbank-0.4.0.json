This function collects the public IP address of the machine (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname, and the installation path, encodes this information in base64, and sends it to a remote server (https://kotko.org) via an HTTP GET request. This exfiltration of environment information without user consent is a clear indicator of malicious behavior, commonly associated with spyware or telemetry without disclosure.",
