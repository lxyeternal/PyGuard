Upon deobfuscation, it is clear that the code downloads a file from a remote URL (https://pastebin.pl/view/raw/e0db51a5), writes its contents to a file named WindowsDefender.py in the user's home directory, executes the downloaded code, and then deletes the file. This is a classic pattern of a downloader/dropper, which is a common technique used by malware to fetch and execute additional payloads from the internet. The use of obfuscation and remote code execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
