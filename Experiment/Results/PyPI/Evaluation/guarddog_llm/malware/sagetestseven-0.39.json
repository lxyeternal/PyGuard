The CustomInstallCommand in the setup.py script performs the following actions during package installation: (1) Creates directories in the Windows Startup folder, (2) Clones two remote GitHub repositories (one named 'test2lmaos', another 'defonotagrabber') into these directories, (3) Moves a Python file (test.py) into the Startup folder, and (4) Executes a binary (main.exe) from the cloned repository. These actions are designed to achieve persistence by ensuring code is executed on system startup, and the use of a repository named 'defonotagrabber' strongly suggests credential or data theft. The code abuses the package installation process to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine, which is a common malware technique.",
