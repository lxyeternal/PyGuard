It then sends this data to an external API endpoint (https://rk8xxqzdug.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Test/response) without user consent. The /etc/passwd file can contain sensitive information about system users, and exfiltrating it is a common step in reconnaissance for attacks. The code is embedded in what appears to be a setup script for a Python package, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware.",
