It then sends this information to a remote server via a webhook URL that is obfuscated using base64 encoding. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware (infostealer), as it exfiltrates private user and system data without consent. The use of a base64-encoded webhook URL is a common tactic to evade simple static detection.",
