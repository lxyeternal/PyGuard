The encoded command (base64) is obfuscated and is executed only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. This is a common technique used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user consent. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' further indicates an attempt to hide the execution from the user. The rest of the code is a standard setup.py script, likely used as a decoy.",
