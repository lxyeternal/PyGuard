The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common technique for obfuscating and executing potentially malicious payloads on Windows systems. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, which is a strong indicator of malware (downloader/trojan behavior). This activity is unrelated to the stated purpose of the package and is hidden within a try/except block to avoid detection and errors.",
