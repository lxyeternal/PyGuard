This is a common technique used by malware to hide its activity and execute potentially harmful commands or download and run additional payloads from the internet. The encoded command appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This behavior is highly indicative of a trojan downloader or dropper, which is a serious security risk.",
