The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. The URL 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0' is present in the decoded command, indicating that it attempts to download and execute a file from Dropbox, which is a known method for delivering malware. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' further indicates an attempt to hide execution from the user. The rest of the code is a standard setup.py script, likely used as a decoy.",
