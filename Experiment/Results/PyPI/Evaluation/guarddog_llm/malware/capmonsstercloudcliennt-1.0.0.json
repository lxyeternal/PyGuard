      "malicious_behavior": "This code overrides the setuptools install command with a custom class (GruppeInstall) that, on Windows systems, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes code that is decrypted at runtime using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed during installation. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious payloads, such as backdoors, downloaders, or other forms of malware, while evading static analysis. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and almost always indicates malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation.",
