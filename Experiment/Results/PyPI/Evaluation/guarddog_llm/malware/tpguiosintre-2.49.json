This is a common technique used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user visibility. The encoded command, when decoded, appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious external URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it, then invoking it again. The use of a hidden window and encoded command, combined with the suspicious download and execution behavior, is a strong indicator of malware.",
