      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and dynamic code execution. Specifically, it uses eval and compile to execute code that is base64-decoded at runtime. The variables 'magic', 'love', 'god', and 'destiny' contain large encoded strings, and the code on line 7 constructs a string by decoding and concatenating these variables using codecs.decode and eval. The final eval(compile(...)) statement executes the decoded payload. This is a classic pattern for Python malware, where the actual malicious logic is hidden in encoded strings and only revealed at runtime. The use of eval, compile, and base64.b64decode in this manner is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is designed to evade static analysis and detection. The code also appears to fetch remote content and may attempt to exfiltrate data or perform other harmful actions.",
