During installation, it collects sensitive information from the system, including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external domain (jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com), which is commonly used for exfiltration and testing by security researchers. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration and is a clear indicator of malicious intent, as it leaks potentially sensitive system information to an external, attacker-controlled server without user consent.",
