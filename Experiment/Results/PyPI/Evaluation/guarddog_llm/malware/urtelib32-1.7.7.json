The CustomInstall class, which is executed during package installation, performs the following suspicious and dangerous actions: (1) It checks for administrator privileges and attempts to elevate if not present, which is a common tactic for malware to gain higher system access. (2) It downloads a file named 'image.png' from a remote server (http://wpp-api-01hw.onrender.com) using a custom authentication header. (3) It reads the downloaded file, decodes it from base64, and executes the resulting code using exec(). This means arbitrary code from the remote server will be executed on the victim's machine during installation, which is a classic remote code execution (RCE) backdoor. These behaviors are highly indicative of a trojan or backdoor, and there is no legitimate reason for a package installer to execute remote code in this manner.",
