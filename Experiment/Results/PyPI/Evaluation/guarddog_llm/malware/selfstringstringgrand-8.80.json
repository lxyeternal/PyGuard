This is a common technique used by malware to hide its activity and execute potentially harmful commands without user knowledge. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a typical evasion or persistence technique. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to run it. This behavior is consistent with a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and executes additional malicious payloads.",
