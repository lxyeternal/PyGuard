The CustomInstall class in the setup script overrides the installation process to perform several suspicious and dangerous actions: (1) It attempts to escalate privileges by relaunching itself as an administrator using Windows APIs. (2) It downloads a file named 'image.png' from a remote server (http://wpp-api-01hw.onrender.com) using a custom authentication header. (3) It reads the downloaded file, decodes it from base64, and executes the resulting code using exec(). This allows arbitrary code execution from a remote source, which is a classic technique for delivering and running malware. (4) The code is obfuscated by using base64 encoding and by hiding the payload on a remote server, making detection and analysis harder. (5) The use of a setup.py script to trigger this behavior during package installation is a common supply chain attack vector.",
