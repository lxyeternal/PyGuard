      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden block at the end that only executes on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). This block downloads files from a suspicious remote server (http://52.14.229.35:1122/connect-CANDC.txt and http://52.14.229.35:1122/shoomsha.jpg), saves them as .txt files, renames them to .bat files, and then executes them using the Windows command shell. This is a classic pattern for downloading and executing potentially malicious code (such as a backdoor, RAT, or other malware) from a command-and-control (C2) server. The code also attempts to escalate privileges by checking for administrative access and tries to hide its tracks by deleting the .bat files after execution. These behaviors are highly indicative of malware, especially as they are hidden in what appears to be a setup.py file for a Python package, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks.",
