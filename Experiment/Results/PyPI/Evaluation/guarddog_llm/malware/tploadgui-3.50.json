The command is run only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, making it difficult to immediately see its intent, but this is a well-known method for delivering and executing malware or downloading further payloads from the internet. The URL in the encoded command (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) suggests it is downloading and executing a file named 'Esquele.exe' from Dropbox, which is a classic malware delivery technique. The use of '-WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' further indicates an attempt to hide the execution from the user.",
