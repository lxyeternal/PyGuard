      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It is a classic example of an information stealer (infostealer) targeting Windows systems. The code performs the following malicious actions: (1) It searches for and extracts sensitive data such as Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords, and cryptocurrency wallet data from various browsers and applications. (2) It decrypts stored credentials using Windows APIs and the browser's master key. (3) It uploads stolen files and data to remote servers (e.g., via gofile.io) and sends detailed reports, including tokens and credentials, to a hardcoded Discord webhook. (4) It attempts to persist itself by copying to the Windows startup folder. (5) It injects malicious JavaScript into Discord installations to steal future credentials. (6) It includes anti-debugging and anti-VM checks to evade analysis. (7) It collects files from user folders (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) based on keywords related to sensitive information. (8) It disables SSL verification to avoid detection. All these behaviors are typical of credential stealers and remote access trojans.",
