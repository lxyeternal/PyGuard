(2) It immediately executes a shell command via os.system to download and execute a shell script from a remote server (https://github.com/nedog123/files/raw/main/aza-ob.sh) with elevated permissions (chmod 777), which can compromise the system. (3) The use of obfuscation in function and variable names, as well as the use of eval, is a strong indicator of intent to hide the true purpose of the code. (4) The code is embedded in what appears to be a setup.py file, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks in Python packages.",
