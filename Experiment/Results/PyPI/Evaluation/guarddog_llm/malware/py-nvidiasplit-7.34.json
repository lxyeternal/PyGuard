      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, but the use of -EncodedCommand and -WindowStyle Hidden is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it attempts to run code without user visibility. The URL 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0' is present in the decoded command, suggesting it downloads and possibly executes a file from Dropbox, which is a common method for delivering malware. The rest of the code is a decoy setup.py for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload.",
