The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, which is decrypted with a hardcoded key and executed via exec(). This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation. The use of obfuscated class names, suspicious author information, and the execution of hidden code during installation are all strong indicators of malware. The code could perform any action on the victim's machine, including data exfiltration, backdoor installation, or other malicious activities.",
