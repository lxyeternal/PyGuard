The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, but upon decoding, it downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (esquelesquad.000webhostapp.com/xEsqueleSquad.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, often used to deliver malware. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates an attempt to hide execution from the user.",
