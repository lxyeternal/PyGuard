The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated, but the use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand is a common technique for hiding malicious activity and evading detection. The URL in the decoded command (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) suggests it is downloading or interacting with a remote resource, which is a typical behavior of malware (downloader or dropper). The code is placed in a setup.py file, which is often used to distribute Python packages, indicating an attempt to infect users who install the package.",
