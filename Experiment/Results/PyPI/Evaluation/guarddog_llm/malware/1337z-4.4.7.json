(2) It downloads a Windows executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe', and executes it using os.system('start '+filename). This is a classic pattern for delivering and running a second-stage payload, which could be malware. (3) The malicious actions are triggered automatically after package installation by overriding the setuptools install command (cmdclass={'install': PostInstallCommand}), ensuring the payload is executed without user consent. These behaviors are typical of supply chain attacks using Python packages.",
