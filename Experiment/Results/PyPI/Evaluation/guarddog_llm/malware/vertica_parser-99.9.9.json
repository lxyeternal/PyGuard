It then encodes this data and exfiltrates it via DNS requests to a domain (uchpuchmak.lol) controlled by the package author. The exfiltration is triggered automatically during install, develop, and egg_info commands by overriding setuptools command classes. This behavior is stealthy and does not inform the user, making it a clear example of malicious data exfiltration (commonly seen in supply chain attacks). The code is intentionally designed to run on package installation, which is a common vector for malicious Python packages.",
