The filename 'rat.py' is a common indicator of a Remote Access Trojan (RAT). The code then ensures the installation of dependencies (requests, pycryptodome) but does not execute the downloaded file directly in this snippet. However, the act of downloading and writing a potentially malicious script from an external source during installation is a clear indicator of malicious behavior, as it can be used to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This is a common technique used in supply chain attacks.",
