This is a common technique used by malware to hide its activity and execute potentially harmful or unauthorized commands on the system. The use of 'WindowStyle Hidden' ensures the PowerShell window is not visible to the user, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior is consistent with a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and executes additional malicious payloads.",
