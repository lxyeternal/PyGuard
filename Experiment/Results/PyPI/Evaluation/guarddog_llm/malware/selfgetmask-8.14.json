The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common anti-analysis or persistence technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, making it difficult to immediately see its intent, but this obfuscation is a hallmark of malware. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a well-known method for executing malicious payloads on Windows systems without user visibility. The rest of the code is a decoy (a standard setup.py script), which is a common tactic to disguise malicious activity in Python packages.",
