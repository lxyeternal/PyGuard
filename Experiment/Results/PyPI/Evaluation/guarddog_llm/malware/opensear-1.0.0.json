The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, which is decrypted with a hardcoded key and executed via exec(). This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation, making it highly likely to be a supply chain attack or malware dropper. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and execution during install are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
