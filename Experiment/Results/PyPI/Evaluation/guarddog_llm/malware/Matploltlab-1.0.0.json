The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string and is decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide and execute malware, such as backdoors, information stealers, or downloaders, without the user's knowledge. The obfuscated class and variable names, as well as the suspicious package metadata, further support the assessment that this is a malicious package.",
