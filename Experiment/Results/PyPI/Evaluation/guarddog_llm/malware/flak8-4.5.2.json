(2) It downloads a Windows executable (python-install.scr) from a suspicious domain (https://python-release.com) and saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe'. (3) It then executes this downloaded file using os.system('start '+filename), which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. (4) The malicious logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command (PostInstallCommand), ensuring it runs automatically when the package is installed, which is a common technique in supply chain attacks. All these behaviors are strong indicators of a malicious Python package.",
