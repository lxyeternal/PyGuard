It also writes a suspicious configuration file to /tmp/config.json, which contains mining pool information and the 'nicehash' mode, commonly associated with cryptocurrency mining. The code then changes the permissions of the downloaded binary to make it executable and executes it with the '--nicehash' argument. This behavior is typical of cryptomining malware, which hijacks system resources to mine cryptocurrency without user consent. The use of /tmp, downloading and executing external binaries, and the mining configuration are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
