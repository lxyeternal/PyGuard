The PowerShell command is encoded and executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which is a common technique used by malware to evade user detection. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a classic dropper/downloader behavior, which is highly indicative of malware.",
