The PowerShell command is encoded and, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic technique used by malware to download and execute additional payloads on the victim's machine without their knowledge. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW further attempts to hide the execution from the user.",
