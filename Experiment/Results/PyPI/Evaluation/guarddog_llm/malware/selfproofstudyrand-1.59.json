The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This is classic dropper/backdoor behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and execute additional malicious payloads. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand are typical evasion techniques to avoid user detection.",
