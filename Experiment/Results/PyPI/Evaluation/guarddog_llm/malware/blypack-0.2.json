This command causes the system to make an outbound HTTP request to a suspicious, non-standard domain (oastify.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band (OOB) data exfiltration and security testing. This behavior is often used by attackers to verify code execution on a victim's machine or to exfiltrate data. The use of os.system to run arbitrary shell commands, especially to external servers, is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
