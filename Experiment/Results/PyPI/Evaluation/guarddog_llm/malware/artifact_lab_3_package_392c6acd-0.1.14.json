      "malicious_behavior": "This code implements a classic reverse shell. It connects to a remote host (6.tcp.eu.ngrok.io) and port (19048) using a TCP socket. Once connected, it redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to the socket, and then spawns an interactive bash shell. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised machine, effectively granting them full remote control. The use of an external host and the redirection of shell I/O are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
