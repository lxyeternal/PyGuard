The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, and the decryption key is hardcoded. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and is a common method for running arbitrary code, which could be used to download further malware, steal data, or perform other malicious actions. The package name 'Matplotblib' is also a typosquat of the popular 'matplotlib', indicating an attempt to trick users into installing it.",
