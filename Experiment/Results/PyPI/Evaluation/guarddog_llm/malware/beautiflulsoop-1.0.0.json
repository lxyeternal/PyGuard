(2) It imports 'requests' and 'fernet' (the latter is a cryptography library). (3) It uses Fernet to decrypt an encrypted payload and then executes the decrypted code with exec(). The decrypted payload is not visible in the source, making it impossible to know exactly what it does without further analysis, but this is a common technique for hiding and executing malicious code (such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or other attacks) during package installation. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and execution during install are all strong indicators of malware.",
