The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command (after decoding) downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe', then runs it and deletes it. This is classic dropper/backdoor behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and execute additional payloads from the internet without user consent. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW is intended to hide the execution from the user.",
