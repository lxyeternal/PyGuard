The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making its behavior intentionally obfuscated and difficult to analyze statically. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent and evade detection. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. Additionally, the package metadata (name, author, description) appears randomly generated, which is another red flag for malicious or suspicious packages.",
