It searches for Discord and browser tokens on the victim's machine by scanning various LevelDB storage locations, extracts potential tokens using regex, and then validates them by making requests to the Discord API. For each valid token, it collects sensitive user information such as email, phone number, and whether the account has payment methods attached. All this data is then exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled Discord webhook (the webhook URL is base64-encoded in the code). The code is designed to run automatically and silently, with error handling to avoid crashing. This is clear credential theft and exfiltration malware.",
