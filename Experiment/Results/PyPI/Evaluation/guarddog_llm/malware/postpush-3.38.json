The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common technique for executing obfuscated or hidden commands, often used in malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user knowledge. The encoded command appears to download and execute a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent (downloading and running remote executables). This behavior is not typical or necessary for legitimate Python package setup scripts.",
