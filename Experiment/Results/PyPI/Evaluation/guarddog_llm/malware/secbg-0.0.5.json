This is done outside of the normal package installation process and is hidden within a try/except block to suppress errors. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute Python code in this way is a common technique used by malicious packages to execute code at install time, potentially allowing for code execution on the user's machine without their knowledge. The modules 'secrevtwo' and 'dist_util' are not standard Python modules, and their purpose is unclear, which increases the risk. This behavior is not typical or necessary for a legitimate setup.py file.",
