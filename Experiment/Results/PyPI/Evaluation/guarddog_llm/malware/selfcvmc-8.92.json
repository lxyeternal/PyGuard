The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and execute additional payloads from the internet without user consent. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and conditional execution) further indicates malicious intent.",
