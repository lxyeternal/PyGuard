Specifically, on Windows systems, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt and execute (via exec) an encrypted payload. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation, making it difficult to detect the actual payload statically. The use of exec on decrypted data is highly suspicious and is a common method for running arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine. The package metadata is also obfuscated and nonsensical, which is another red flag.",
