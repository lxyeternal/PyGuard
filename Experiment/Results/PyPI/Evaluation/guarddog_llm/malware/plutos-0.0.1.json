This behavior is characteristic of malware droppers or loaders, which are used to fetch and run potentially malicious payloads on a victim's machine.

After execution, it attempts to remove the evidence by deleting the temporary directory. This behavior is characteristic of malware: downloading and executing untrusted binaries, using system-like directory names to evade detection, and cleaning up traces. The use of Discord CDN as a payload host is a common tactic in malware distribution.",
