This is a common technique used by malware to hide its activity and execute potentially harmful commands or download and run additional payloads. The encoded command appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and save it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then execute it. This behavior is highly indicative of a trojan dropper or downloader, which is a serious security risk.",
