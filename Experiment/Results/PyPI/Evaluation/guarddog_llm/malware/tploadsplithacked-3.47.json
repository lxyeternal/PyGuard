      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is run with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW', ensuring it is invisible to the user. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, often used to infect the system with additional malicious payloads. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) and stealth (hidden window, no user interaction) further confirms the malicious intent.",
