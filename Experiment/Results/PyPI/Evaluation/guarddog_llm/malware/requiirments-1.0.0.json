The payload is not visible in the source code, making its behavior intentionally hidden and obfuscated. This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and analysis. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The package name 'requiirments' is also a common typo-squatting technique to trick users into installing the malicious package instead of the legitimate 'requirements' or 'requirements.txt'.",
