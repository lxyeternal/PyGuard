The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed during installation. This is a classic technique for hiding malicious code from static analysis and is commonly used in malware to download or execute additional payloads, steal information, or perform other harmful actions. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution. The obfuscated class and variable names further indicate an attempt to evade detection.",
