(2) On Windows systems, it downloads an executable file (python-install.scr) from an external site (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as ini_file_pyp_41.exe, and executes it using os.system('start '+filename). This is a classic technique for delivering and executing a second-stage payload, which could be any form of malware. (3) The use of a setup.py script to trigger these actions during package installation is a common method for supply chain attacks in Python packages. All of these behaviors are highly indicative of a malicious package designed to compromise the system of anyone who installs it.",
