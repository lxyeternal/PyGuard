The PowerShell command is run with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which is commonly used to conceal malicious activity from the user. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes them. This is a classic pattern for a dropper or loader malware, which downloads and runs additional malicious payloads.",
