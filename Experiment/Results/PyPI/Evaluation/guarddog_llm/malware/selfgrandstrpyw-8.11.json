This is a common technique used by malware to hide its execution and run obfuscated or remote code. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This behavior is indicative of a downloader or dropper, which is a classic malware pattern. The use of a hidden window and encoded command further suggests an attempt to evade detection.",
