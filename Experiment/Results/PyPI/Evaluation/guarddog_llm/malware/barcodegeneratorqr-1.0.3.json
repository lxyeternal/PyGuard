This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malicious packages, as it allows arbitrary code execution from an external, potentially untrusted source without user consent. This can be used to deliver and execute malware on the victim's machine. The obfuscation of the URL using string concatenation further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
