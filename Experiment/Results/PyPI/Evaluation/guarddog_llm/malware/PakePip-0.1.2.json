It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when the package is installed (e.g., via pip), executes a reverse shell payload. The payload connects back to a remote host (LHOST) and port (LPORT) controlled by the attacker, giving them remote shell access to the victim's machine. The reverse shell command is base64-encoded and then executed via os.system using bash, which is a common technique to evade simple string-based detection. The package is also named and described in a way that suggests it is intended to exploit users with sudo privileges who install Python packages. This is a classic example of a supply chain attack via a malicious Python package.",
