The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its true behavior and evade static analysis. The suspiciously obfuscated class name, author, and description further support the conclusion that this package is designed to perform malicious actions upon installation.",
