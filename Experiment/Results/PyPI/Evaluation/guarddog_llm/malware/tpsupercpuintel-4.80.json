This is a common technique used by malware to hide its activity and execute potentially harmful commands without user knowledge. The payload downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it, all while hiding the window. The check for the existence of the 'tahg' file is likely used as a simple persistence or anti-redundancy mechanism. The rest of the code is a decoy setup script to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
