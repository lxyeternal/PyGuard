It defines a custom setuptools install command (PostInstallCommand) that, upon package installation, collects sensitive system information including OS details, uptime, and the host's IP address. It then establishes a TCP connection to a remote server at 134.209.85.64:9090 and exfiltrates this information. This behavior is hidden in the installation process and is not disclosed to the user, which is a common technique used in malicious Python packages to steal information from unsuspecting users.",
