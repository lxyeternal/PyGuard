Specifically, it collects the hostname and local IP address of the machine where the package is being installed and sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This exfiltration of system information to an external server without user consent is a clear indicator of malicious behavior, commonly associated with information-stealing malware. The use of a Discord webhook for data exfiltration is a known tactic in malicious Python packages.",
