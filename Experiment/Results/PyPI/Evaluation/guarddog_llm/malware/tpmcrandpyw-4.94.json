The command is only executed if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, but decoding it reveals that it downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic example of a downloader/dropper, which is a well-known malware behavior. The rest of the code is a decoy setup.py for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious intent.",
