The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common technique for obfuscating and executing potentially harmful commands without user visibility. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, which is a classic indicator of malware attempting to download and run additional payloads. This behavior is not consistent with legitimate package setup scripts and is highly suspicious.",
