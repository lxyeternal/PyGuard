The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden, CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and run additional payloads from the internet without user consent. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden execution) further indicates malicious intent.",
