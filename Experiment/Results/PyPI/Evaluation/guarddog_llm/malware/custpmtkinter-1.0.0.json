It defines a custom install command (hVxLTBMyxhioAyrPXOeAhseZWwJJNnXkBIEoGzQnMuqYpNHDppengdisRhdvBbPdcxOCozwTPABbe) that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload via exec(). The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its true behavior and evade static analysis. The use of a custom install command in setup.py to trigger this behavior is also a known attack vector in supply chain attacks.",
