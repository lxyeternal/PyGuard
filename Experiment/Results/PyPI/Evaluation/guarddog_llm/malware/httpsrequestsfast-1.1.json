It searches for Discord and browser LevelDB files on the victim's machine, extracts potential Discord authentication tokens using regex, checks which tokens are valid by making authenticated requests to the Discord API, and then collects sensitive user information such as email, phone number, and payment method status. It then exfiltrates this data to a remote Discord webhook (the webhook URL is base64-encoded in the code). This is a clear case of credential theft and unauthorized data exfiltration.",
