The encrypted payload is not visible in the source, making it impossible to determine its intent without decryption, but this is a common technique used to hide malicious actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoor installation. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The obfuscated class and variable names further suggest an attempt to evade detection.",
