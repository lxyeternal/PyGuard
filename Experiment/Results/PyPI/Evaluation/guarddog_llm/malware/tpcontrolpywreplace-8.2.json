      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is run with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW', ensuring it is invisible to the user. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a classic pattern for a trojan dropper or loader, commonly used in malware to fetch and execute additional malicious payloads. The check for the existence of the 'tahg' file is likely an anti-redundancy or anti-analysis measure. The rest of the code is a decoy (setup.py metadata).",
