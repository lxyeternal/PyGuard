The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, but decoding it reveals that it downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150594004/Esquele.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, often used to infect the host with additional malicious payloads. The use of hidden execution and encoded commands further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
