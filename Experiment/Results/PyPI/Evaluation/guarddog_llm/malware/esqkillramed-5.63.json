The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, which is highly indicative of malware.",
