After execution, it attempts to remove traces by deleting the temporary directory. This is a classic pattern for malware dropper/loader behavior: fetching and running potentially malicious binaries from the internet without user consent. The use of misleading directory names and cleanup attempts further indicate intent to evade detection.",
