The PowerShell command is encoded and appears to download and execute a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and then runs it as a hidden process. This is a classic technique used by malware to download and execute additional payloads from the internet without user consent. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and EncodedCommand are both indicators of malicious intent, as they are commonly used to evade detection.",
