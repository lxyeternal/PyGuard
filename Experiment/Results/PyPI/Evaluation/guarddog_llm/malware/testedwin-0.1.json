      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a classic example of a Python backdoor. Upon installation (via the custom PostInstallCommand), it launches the 'mal' function, which connects to a remote host (http://46.101.114.247:80) and enters a command-and-control loop. It receives commands from the remote server, executes arbitrary shell commands, and exfiltrates the output (stdout and stderr) back to the attacker. It also supports file exfiltration via the 'grab' command, allowing the attacker to steal arbitrary files from the victim's machine. The use of requests to communicate with a hardcoded IP, the execution of arbitrary shell commands, and the exfiltration of data are all clear indicators of malicious intent.",
