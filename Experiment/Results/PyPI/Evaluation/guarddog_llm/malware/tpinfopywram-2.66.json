The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. Decoding the payload reveals that it downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, which is highly indicative of malware.",
