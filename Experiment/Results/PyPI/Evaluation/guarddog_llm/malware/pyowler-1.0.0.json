It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, during installation, performs the following actions: (1) It contains a large, obfuscated string (wopvEaTEcopFEavc) and a numeric string (iOpvEoeaaeavocp). (2) It uses these two strings to perform an XOR operation, reconstructing a hidden Python script (oIoeaTEAcvpae). (3) It then executes the reconstructed code using eval(compile(..., 'exec')), which is a classic technique for hiding and executing arbitrary or malicious code during package installation. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is commonly used to deliver malware or backdoors via Python packages.",
