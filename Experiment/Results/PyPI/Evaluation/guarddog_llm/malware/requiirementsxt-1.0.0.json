The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed during installation. This is a classic technique used to hide malicious payloads from static analysis and to evade detection. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and is a common indicator of malware, as it allows arbitrary code execution. The package name 'requiirementsxt' is also a typosquat of 'requirements.txt', which is a common trick used to trick users into installing malicious packages. The obfuscated class and variable names further indicate an attempt to hide the true purpose of the code.",
