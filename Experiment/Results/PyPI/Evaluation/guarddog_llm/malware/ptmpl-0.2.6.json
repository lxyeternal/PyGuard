This leaks the installer's public IP address and possibly other metadata to an external server without user consent. This is a classic example of a privacy-violating behavior often seen in malicious or telemetry-collecting packages. The code also contains commented-out lines that reference cryptographic operations and remote code execution (via Fernet and exec), which, if enabled, could be used for more severe malicious actions. The use of a custom install command to perform network operations during installation is highly suspicious and not standard practice for legitimate packages.",
