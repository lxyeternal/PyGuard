It then copies this batch file into the Windows Startup folder, ensuring it will execute on every system boot (persistence mechanism). Finally, it forcibly restarts the computer using os.system('shutdown /r /f'). The downloaded batch file's contents are not shown, but downloading and persisting remote code is a common malware technique. The use of the Startup folder for persistence and forced reboot are both strong indicators of malicious intent.",
