      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the standard setuptools 'install' and 'develop' commands to make HTTP GET requests to an external domain (http://poiqwe.info) during both installation and development setup. This behavior is highly suspicious and commonly associated with malicious activity, such as exfiltrating information about the environment or acting as a beacon to notify an attacker of a new installation. There is no legitimate reason for a package's setup script to contact an external server during installation, especially a non-standard domain. This could be used for tracking, data exfiltration, or as a precursor to further malicious actions.",
