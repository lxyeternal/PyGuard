The encrypted payload is not visible in the source, making it impossible to determine its intent without decryption, but this is a common technique used to hide malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or other unauthorized actions. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation.",
