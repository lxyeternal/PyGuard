The decoded payload imports modules for creating temporary files, executing system commands, and downloading and executing code from a remote URL (http://wasp.plague.fun/inject/5OMHH3DGlNjKXj4n). This is a classic pattern for a remote code execution backdoor or dropper. The code attempts to download and execute a payload from the internet, which is a clear sign of malicious behavior.",
