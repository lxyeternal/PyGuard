The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. The URL 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0' is present in the decoded command, indicating that it attempts to download and execute a file named 'Esquele.exe' from Dropbox, saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory and then executing it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, which is highly indicative of malware.",
