The payload is not visible in the source code, making its behavior intentionally hidden and obfuscated. This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and deliver malicious code at install time. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the target system. The package metadata is also nonsensical, which is another red flag.",
