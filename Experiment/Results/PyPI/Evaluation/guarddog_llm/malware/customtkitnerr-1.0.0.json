Specifically, it imports the Fernet cryptography library and uses a hardcoded key to decrypt and execute a payload (via exec) that is stored as an encrypted string. The payload is only executed on Windows systems. The use of exec on decrypted data, especially in a package installation context, is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the target machine. The use of random-looking names, fake metadata, and the inclusion of 'requests' (often used for C2 or exfiltration) further supports this assessment.",
