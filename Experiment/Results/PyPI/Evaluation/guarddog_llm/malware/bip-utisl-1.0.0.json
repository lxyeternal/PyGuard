The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string and is only decrypted and executed at install time. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code, as the actual behavior is obfuscated and only revealed at runtime. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and is a common method for running arbitrary or malicious code. The package metadata (name, author, etc.) is also nonsensical, which is typical of malware or supply chain attacks.",
