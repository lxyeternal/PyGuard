      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a credential stealer (commonly called a 'cookie grabber') targeting Roblox users. It attempts to extract the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie from multiple browsers using the browser_cookie3 library. This cookie is a sensitive authentication token that allows full access to the victim's Roblox account. The code then validates the cookie, collects additional information about the Roblox account (such as username, Robux balance, account age, etc.), and the victim's public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org/). All of this information, including the stolen cookie, is then sent to a Discord webhook controlled by the attacker. This is a clear example of malicious behavior, specifically credential theft and exfiltration of sensitive user data.",
