It locates and decrypts stored credentials from various browsers (Chrome, Brave, Edge, Opera, etc.) and Discord installations, writes them to files, and then exfiltrates these files to an external attacker-controlled endpoint via Discord webhooks and potentially Telegram's bot API. The code uses Windows cryptography APIs to decrypt browser-stored secrets, and the exfiltration logic is clearly present in the post_to() function, which uploads the stolen data. This is classic information-stealer malware behavior.",
