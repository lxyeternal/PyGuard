      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is run with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which hides the window, and the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is commonly used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes them. This is a classic pattern for a dropper or downloader malware, which is used to infect the system with additional malicious payloads. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote code download and execution are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
