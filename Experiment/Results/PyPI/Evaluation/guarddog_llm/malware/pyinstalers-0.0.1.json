It decodes and executes a payload that downloads additional code from a remote server (http://20.226.18.203/grab/ry2K1CIVRSFa59vT and http://20.226.18.203/clip), writes it to a temporary file, and attempts to execute it as a process. This is classic downloader/backdoor behavior, which can be used to deliver further malware or allow remote control of the infected system. The use of exec, compile, and base64 decoding is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
