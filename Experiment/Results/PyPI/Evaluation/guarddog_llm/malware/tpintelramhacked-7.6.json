      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The encoded PowerShell command (when decoded) downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe', then runs it and deletes the file. This is a classic pattern for a dropper or loader, which is a type of malware that downloads and executes additional malicious payloads. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates an attempt to hide execution from the user. The rest of the code is a decoy setup.py for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious intent.",
