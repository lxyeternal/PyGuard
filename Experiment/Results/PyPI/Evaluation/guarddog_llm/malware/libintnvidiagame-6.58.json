The command is run only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, but the use of -EncodedCommand and -WindowStyle Hidden is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it attempts to hide its execution from the user. The URL 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0' is present in the decoded command, suggesting it downloads and possibly executes a file from Dropbox, which is a common method for delivering malware. The rest of the file is a decoy setup.py for a fake Python package, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks.",
