The payload uses hexadecimal and base64 encoding to hide its true intent. When the HTTPError class is loaded, the code executes a chain of imports and decodes a base64-encoded Python script. This script downloads and executes a remote payload from 'https://zerotwo-best-waifu.online/778112985743251/wap/shalegay/injector0x9748', writes it to a temporary file, and attempts to execute it as a process. This is a classic remote code execution backdoor, and the obfuscation is designed to evade detection. This is a clear and severe security risk.",
