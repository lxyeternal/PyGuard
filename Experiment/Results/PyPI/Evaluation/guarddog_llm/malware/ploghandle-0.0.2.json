It then concatenates this data, encodes it in base64, and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://1.15.77.2/v/...). This is a clear case of data exfiltration. Additionally, the use of subprocess.Popen to execute an arbitrary file (whose path is constructed from the package's __init__.py path) is suspicious and could be used for further code execution or persistence. These behaviors are typical of malicious code designed to steal information and potentially execute further payloads.",
