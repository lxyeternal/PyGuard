The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), and its decoded content attempts to download and execute a file from a suspicious external URL (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150599404/Esquele.exe) and then run it, saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe'. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' further indicates an attempt to hide the execution from the user.",
