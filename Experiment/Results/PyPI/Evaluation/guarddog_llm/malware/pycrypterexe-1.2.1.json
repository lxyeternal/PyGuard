(2) It scrapes Discord tokens from various browsers and Discord installations. (3) It uploads all stolen data to a remote server via a Discord webhook. (4) It implements a reverse shell (RAT) that connects to a remote server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. (5) It attempts to establish persistence and can be used to exfiltrate further data or control the system. The code is clearly designed for unauthorized data theft and remote control.",
