The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common technique for executing obfuscated or hidden commands on Windows systems, often used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user knowledge. The encoded command appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe) and then runs it, which is a clear indicator of malicious intent (downloading and executing remote code). This behavior is not consistent with legitimate package setup scripts and is a strong indicator of malware.",
