The encoded command (Base64) decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475145059404/Esquele.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This is a classic technique for delivering and executing malware on a victim's machine. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and the check for a non-existent file ('tahg') are further indicators of an attempt to evade detection and ensure the payload is only executed once.",
