It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://pt.traktrain.com/RCE_PYTHON). This is a classic example of information exfiltration, which is a common malicious behavior. The use of os.popen to execute shell commands and urllib to transmit the results to a remote server is highly suspicious and not typical for legitimate package setup scripts.",
