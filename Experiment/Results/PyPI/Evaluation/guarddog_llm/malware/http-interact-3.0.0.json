It downloads files from a suspicious remote server (http://52.14.229.35:1122/connect-CANDC.txt and http://52.14.229.35:1122/shoomsha.jpg), saves them locally, renames them to .bat files, and executes them using the Windows command shell. This is a classic pattern for downloading and executing remote code, which could be used for remote access, command and control (C2), or further malware installation. The code also attempts to escalate privileges by checking for administrative access and prompts the user to reinstall with administrative permissions if not present. These behaviors are not consistent with legitimate package setup scripts and are highly indicative of a trojan or backdoor.",
