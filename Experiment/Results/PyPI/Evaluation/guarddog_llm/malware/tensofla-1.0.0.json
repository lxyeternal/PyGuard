      "malicious_behavior": "This setup.py script defines a custom install command that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes code that is decrypted at runtime using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed during installation. This is a classic technique used to hide malicious payloads from static analysis and to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows the attacker to run any code they choose on the target system. The obfuscated class name and author information further suggest an attempt to evade detection.",
