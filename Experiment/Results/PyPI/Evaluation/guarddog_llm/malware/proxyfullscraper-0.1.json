Specifically, it recursively scans directories for files with .py, .php, and .zip extensions, as well as all images in the DCIM folder (commonly used for photos on mobile devices), and sends them to a Telegram bot via the Telegram API. The hardcoded bot token and chat ID indicate that the attacker will receive these files. This is a classic example of data theft/exfiltration malware.",
