This function decodes a base64 string and passes the result to os.system(), which executes arbitrary shell commands. The decoded string is 'echo hola que tal > true.xml', which writes a message to a file named true.xml. While this specific payload is not directly harmful, the mechanism allows arbitrary code execution during package installation, which is a common technique in malicious Python packages (supply chain attacks). The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the command further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
