The base64 payload decodes to a large, obfuscated Python script that appears to perform file system enumeration, data exfiltration, and possibly communication with a remote server (as indicated by the presence of URLs and network-related code in the decoded payload). This behavior is highly indicative of a trojan or backdoor being dropped and executed during package installation, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks in Python packages. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and triggering on install commands are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
