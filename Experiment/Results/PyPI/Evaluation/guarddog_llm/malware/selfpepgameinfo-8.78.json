      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. The URL 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0' is present in the decoded command, indicating that it attempts to download and execute a file from Dropbox, which is a known method for delivering malicious payloads. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' further indicates an attempt to hide execution from the user. The rest of the code is a decoy setup.py for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious intent.",
