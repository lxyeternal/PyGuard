      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly obfuscated and uses multiple layers of dynamic code execution. It constructs a string (trust) by decoding and concatenating several variables (magic, love, god, destiny) using codecs.decode and eval. Then, it decodes a base64-encoded payload and executes it using eval(compile(..., 'exec')). The use of eval, compile, and base64 decoding is a common technique in malware to hide the true intent of the code and evade detection. The decoded payload (from the 'magic', 'love', 'god', 'destiny' variables) is likely to be a second-stage malicious script. Additionally, the code makes network requests, collects system information, and may download and execute further payloads. All these are strong indicators of malicious behavior.",
