The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making static analysis difficult and strongly indicating an attempt to hide malicious code. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a common technique for executing arbitrary or harmful code during package installation. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malware, such as information stealers, backdoors, or other forms of compromise.",
