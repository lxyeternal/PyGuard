The PowerShell command is encoded and is likely designed to download and execute a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and save it as 'Esquele.exe', then run it. This is a classic technique used by malware to download and execute additional payloads on the victim's machine without their knowledge. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates an attempt to evade user detection.",
