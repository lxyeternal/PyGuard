It then exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to an external domain (jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band data collection and is not a legitimate service endpoint. This behavior is a clear indicator of malicious intent, as it covertly sends potentially sensitive user information to an attacker-controlled server during package installation.",
