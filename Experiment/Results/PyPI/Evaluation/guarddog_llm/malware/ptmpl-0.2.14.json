This leaks the installer's public IP address and possibly other metadata to an external server without user consent. This is a classic example of a privacy-violating phone-home behavior, which is considered malicious in most software supply chain contexts. Additionally, there is commented-out code that would have executed an encrypted payload, which is a strong indicator of intent to hide further malicious actions, though it is not active in this version.",
