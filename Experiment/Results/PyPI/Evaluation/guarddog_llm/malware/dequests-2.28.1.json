      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a list of executables from a remote server (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt), then downloads and saves each executable matching the current operating system. It sets executable permissions (on Linux/macOS) and executes the downloaded files in the background. This is classic dropper/downloader behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and run additional payloads. Furthermore, the code is designed to masquerade as a replacement for the requests library, so any code importing this file and using its HTTP functions will trigger the malicious payload, making it stealthy and dangerous.",
