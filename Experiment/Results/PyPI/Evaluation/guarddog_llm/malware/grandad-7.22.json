The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden, CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This behavior is highly suspicious and is a common technique used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user knowledge. The check for the existence of a file named 'tahg' is likely used as a persistence or execution guard. The use of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell in a Python package setup script is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it attempts to hide its true purpose and evade detection.",
