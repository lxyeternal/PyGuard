The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), and the URL 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0' is present in the decoded command, indicating it tries to download and execute a file from Dropbox. This is a classic indicator of a downloader or dropper, which is a common malware technique. The use of '-WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' further attempts to hide the execution from the user. The code is clearly designed to covertly download and run an external executable, which is highly malicious behavior.",
