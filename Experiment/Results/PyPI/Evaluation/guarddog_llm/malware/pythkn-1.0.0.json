The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, and the decryption key is hardcoded. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide and execute malware, such as backdoors, downloaders, or credential stealers, without the user's knowledge. The obfuscated class and variable names, as well as the suspicious author information, further support the assessment that this code is malicious.",
