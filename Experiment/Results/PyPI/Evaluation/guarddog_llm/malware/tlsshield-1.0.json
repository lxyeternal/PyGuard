It then launches a new process using a modified Python executable name (replacing .exe with w.exe) to execute this temporary file. This is a classic pattern for remote code execution and is highly indicative of malicious behavior, as it allows arbitrary code from the internet to be executed on the victim's machine without their knowledge.",
