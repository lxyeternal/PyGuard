The PowerShell command is run with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which hides the window from the user, and the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is commonly used to obfuscate the actual command being run. The decoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and runs additional malicious payloads.",
