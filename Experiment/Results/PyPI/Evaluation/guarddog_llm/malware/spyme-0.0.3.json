It then executes one of these executables (Alistener.exe) in the background. The naming and behavior (downloading and executing binaries, one of which is named as a keylogger) are consistent with common malware tactics, such as installing a keylogger, a reverse shell, and a listener for remote access. The code is triggered during the installation process (pip install), which is a known technique for supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute arbitrary binaries in this manner.",
