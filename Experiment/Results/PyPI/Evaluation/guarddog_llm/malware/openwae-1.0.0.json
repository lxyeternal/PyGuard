The code uses Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt and execute a payload at install time. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code, such as backdoors, downloaders, or other forms of malware, while evading static analysis. The use of exec() on decrypted data, the obfuscated class name, and the requirement for 'requests' and 'fernet' (which are not needed for normal package installation) are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
