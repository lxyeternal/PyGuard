The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string and is only decrypted and executed at install time. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation, making detection and analysis more difficult. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and is a common indicator of malware, as it allows arbitrary code execution. The package metadata (name, author, description) is also obfuscated, which is another red flag.",
