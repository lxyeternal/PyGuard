The decrypted payload is not visible in the source, making it impossible to determine its intent without decryption, but this pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior (e.g., downloading and executing further malware, establishing persistence, stealing data, etc.). The use of encrypted, runtime-decrypted, and executed code is a strong sign of an attempt to evade detection and hide malicious actions. This behavior is triggered automatically during package installation, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks.",
