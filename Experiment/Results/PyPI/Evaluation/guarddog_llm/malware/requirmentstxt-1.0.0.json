The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide and execute malware, such as backdoors, credential stealers, or downloaders, without the user's knowledge. The package name ('requirmentstxt') is also suspiciously similar to 'requirements.txt', likely to trick users into installing it by mistake.",
