It locates and decrypts stored credentials from various browsers (Chrome, Brave, Edge, Opera, etc.) and Discord installations, writes them to local files, and then exfiltrates these files to an external attacker-controlled endpoint via a Discord webhook and/or Telegram bot API. The code also attempts to clean up evidence by deleting the files after exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded webhook and Telegram API endpoints, combined with the automated collection and exfiltration of credentials, is a clear indicator of credential-stealing malware.",
