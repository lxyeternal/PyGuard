The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed during installation. This is a classic technique used to hide malicious payloads from static analysis and to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscated class names, suspicious author information, and the lack of any legitimate package functionality further indicate malicious intent. The decrypted payload could perform any action, such as data exfiltration, backdoor installation, or other harmful activities.",
