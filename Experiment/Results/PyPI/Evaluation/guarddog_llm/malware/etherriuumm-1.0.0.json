The payload is not visible in the source code, making its behavior intentionally hidden and obfuscated. This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it allows for remote code execution. The package metadata (name, author, description) is also nonsensical, which is typical of malicious packages attempting to masquerade as legitimate ones.",
