During the installation process (via the custom PostInstallCommand), it collects the COMPUTERNAME environment variable and sends it to a remote server (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation new c kw ...), which is a form of data exfiltration. Additionally, if the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable file (python-install.scr) from another remote server (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and then executes it using os.system('start '+filename). This is a classic pattern for delivering and executing a second-stage payload, which is highly indicative of malware. The use of a setup.py script to trigger this behavior during package installation is a common technique for supply chain attacks in Python packages.",
