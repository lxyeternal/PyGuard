This is a common technique used by malware to hide its activity and execute potentially harmful commands or download and run additional payloads from the internet. The encoded command, when decoded, appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe', then runs it. This behavior is highly indicative of a trojan or dropper, as it downloads and executes an external binary without user consent.",
