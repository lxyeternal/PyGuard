It defines a custom install command (GruppeInstall) that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload via exec(). The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making static analysis difficult and hiding its true intent. This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious behavior.",
