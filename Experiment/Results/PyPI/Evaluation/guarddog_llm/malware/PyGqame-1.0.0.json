The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, and is executed via exec(). This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and execution during install strongly indicates malicious intent, such as installing malware, backdoors, or stealing information.",
