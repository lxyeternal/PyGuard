      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which hides the PowerShell window from the user. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote URL (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, often used to deliver malware. The code also tries to evade detection by only running if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, and it suppresses errors with a broad try/except. The use of a hidden PowerShell window, encoded commands, and remote file execution are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
