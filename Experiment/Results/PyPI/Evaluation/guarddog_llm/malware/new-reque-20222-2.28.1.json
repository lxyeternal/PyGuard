      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden block at the end that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), downloads files from a suspicious remote server (http://52.14.229.35:1122/connect-CANDC.txt and http://52.14.229.35:1122/shoomsha.jpg), saves them as .txt files, renames them to .bat files, and executes them using cmd. This is a classic pattern for downloading and executing remote code, which can be used to deliver malware or establish a remote control channel (C2/C&C). The code also attempts to escalate privileges by checking for administrative access (using 'net session'), and if not present, prompts the user to reinstall with admin rights. All of this is hidden after a large block of whitespace, making it less likely to be noticed. This behavior is highly indicative of a trojan or backdoor.",
