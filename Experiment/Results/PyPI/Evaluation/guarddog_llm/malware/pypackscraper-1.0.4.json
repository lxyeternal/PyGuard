It sets built-in attributes to override or manipulate Python's built-in functions (e.g., __builtins__.__print__, __builtins__.__exec__, __builtins__.__eval__), which is a common technique in malware to hijack or hide malicious activity. The code also decompresses and decodes a base64-encoded, zlib-compressed payload, then executes it dynamically. The use of randomization in the lambda function and the presence of a large, obfuscated data blob suggest attempts to evade static analysis and signature-based detection. These are all strong indicators of malicious intent, such as downloading and executing further payloads, data exfiltration, or establishing persistence.",
