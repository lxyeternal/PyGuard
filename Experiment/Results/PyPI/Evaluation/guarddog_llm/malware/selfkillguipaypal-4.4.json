The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. The URL 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0' is present in the decoded command, indicating that the script is likely downloading and executing a remote executable file. This behavior is consistent with a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and runs additional malicious payloads from the internet. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' further indicates an attempt to hide the execution from the user.",
