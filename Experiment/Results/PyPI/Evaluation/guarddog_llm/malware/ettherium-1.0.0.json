The payload is not visible in plaintext, making its intent deliberately obfuscated. Executing arbitrary, encrypted code during package installation is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and deliver malicious payloads. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malicious Python packages (often seen in supply chain attacks).",
