It is a fully functional Discord RAT (Remote Access Trojan) with the following capabilities: 1) Steals Chrome cookies and browser history and exfiltrates them via Discord. 2) Takes screenshots and webcam pictures and sends them to the attacker's Discord server. 3) Executes arbitrary shell commands on the victim's machine. 4) Can trigger a system shutdown or blue screen (crash) on the victim's computer. 5) Can change the victim's wallpaper and display fake error messages. 6) Steals Discord and browser tokens, allowing account hijacking. 7) Uses hardcoded Discord bot tokens to connect to an attacker's server. 8) Attempts to evade detection by minimizing its window and suppressing Discord library logs. 9) The flagged line (requests.get to https://discord.com/api/v9/users/@me) is used to validate and enumerate stolen Discord tokens. This is a classic indicator of token theft malware. The code is not a false positive; it is intentionally designed for unauthorized access, data theft, and remote control of the victim's system.",
