This function collects the public IP address of the machine (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname, and the local path of the installation. It then encodes this information and sends it to a remote server (https://kotko.org) via an HTTP GET request. This exfiltration of environment information without user consent is a clear privacy violation and is a common indicator of malicious or unwanted behavior in Python packages.",
