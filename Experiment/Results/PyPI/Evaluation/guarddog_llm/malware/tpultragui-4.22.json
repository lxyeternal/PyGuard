      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a common initial stage in malware infections. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW is intended to hide the execution from the user. The code is obfuscated and attempts to evade detection, which are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
