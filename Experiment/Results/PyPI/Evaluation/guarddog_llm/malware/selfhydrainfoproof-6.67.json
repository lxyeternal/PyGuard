      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious remote host (esquelesquad.000webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquad.exe) and then runs it, likely as a form of malware delivery or remote access tool. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand are common techniques to evade detection and hide execution. The code is obfuscated and attempts to blend in as a setup script for a Python package, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks.",
