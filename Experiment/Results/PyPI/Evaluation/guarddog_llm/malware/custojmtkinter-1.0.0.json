The decryption key and encrypted data are hardcoded. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation, making detection and analysis more difficult. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and is a common method for running arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine. The package metadata is also obfuscated and nonsensical, which is another red flag.",
