      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a ZIP file from an external source (https://transfer.sh/ODT39X/Updater.zip) using PowerShell, extracts it to C:/ProgramData, installs a large number of Python packages (including some commonly used in malware such as pycryptodome, pywin32, flask_cloudflared, pynput, etc.), and then executes a VBS script (launch.vbs) and a Python script (update.py) from the downloaded archive. This behavior is highly suspicious and consistent with malware: it downloads and executes code from the internet, attempts to hide its execution (using hidden windows), and installs potentially dangerous dependencies. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=True and the execution of arbitrary PowerShell commands further increases the risk. There is no legitimate reason for a Python package setup script to perform these actions.",
