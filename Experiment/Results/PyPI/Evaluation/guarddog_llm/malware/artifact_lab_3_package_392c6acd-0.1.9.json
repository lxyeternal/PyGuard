It connects to a remote host (4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io) on port 10308 and redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to the socket. It then spawns a bash shell whose input and output are sent over the network connection. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised machine, effectively granting them full control. The use of ngrok.io as a host and the explicit use of /dev/tcp in the bash command are strong indicators of malicious intent, as these are common techniques used to bypass firewalls and establish unauthorized remote access.",
