This is a common technique used by malware to hide its execution and run obfuscated or remote code. The command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. The check for the existence of the 'tahg' file is likely used as a simple persistence or anti-redundancy mechanism. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection or analysis. This behavior is highly indicative of a trojan or dropper.",
