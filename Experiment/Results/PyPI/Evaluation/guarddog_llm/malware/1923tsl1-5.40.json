(2) It constructs a path in the user's TEMP directory for a file named 'temp-PipInstall.exe'. (3) It uses the Windows registry to add a RunOnce key, ensuring that the downloaded executable will run on the next login. (4) It downloads an executable ('esqueleDrp.exe') from a remote Dropbox URL using curl and saves it to the constructed path. (5) It immediately executes the downloaded file. These behaviors—downloading and executing a remote binary, persisting via the registry, and user targeting—are all hallmarks of malware.",
