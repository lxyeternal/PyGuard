The encoded command (Base64) decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, attempting to evade detection by hiding the PowerShell window and using encoded commands. The check for the existence of the 'tahg' file is likely used as a marker to avoid repeated execution. The rest of the code is a decoy setup.py for a fake Python package.",
