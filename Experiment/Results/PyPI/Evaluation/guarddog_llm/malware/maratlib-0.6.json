First, it uses eval() on the result of a custom string deobfuscation function (l111_cringe_), which is a common obfuscation technique to hide the real payload. Second, and most critically, it executes a shell command via subprocess to download and execute a remote shell script (aza.sh) from an external server (github.com/nedog123/files/raw/main/aza.sh), saving it as gay.sh, making it executable, and running it. This is a textbook example of a remote code execution and potential backdoor installation. The use of obfuscation and the execution of remote code are both strong indicators of malicious intent.",
