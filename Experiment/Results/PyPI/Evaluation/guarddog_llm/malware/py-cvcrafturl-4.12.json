This is a common technique used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user visibility. The encoded command, when decoded, attempts to download and execute a file from a suspicious remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe', then runs it and deletes the file. This behavior is highly indicative of a trojan dropper or loader.",
