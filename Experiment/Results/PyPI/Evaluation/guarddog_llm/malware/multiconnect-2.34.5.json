This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malware delivery and execution. The code does not inform the user or require consent, and the remote content is not verified or checked for safety. The commented-out section further shows intent to persist malicious code by writing a loader to the Windows Startup folder and repeatedly executing it. These are clear indicators of malicious behavior.",
