The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe', then runs it and deletes the file. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and execute additional payloads from the internet without user consent. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) and hidden execution further indicate malicious intent.",
