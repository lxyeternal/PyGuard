The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This is a common technique used in supply chain attacks to deliver malware. The suspicious author and package metadata, as well as the obfuscated long description, further support the assessment that this package is designed to perform malicious actions.",
