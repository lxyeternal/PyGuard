The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This is a common technique used in supply chain attacks to deliver malware. The obfuscated class name and meaningless metadata further suggest an attempt to evade detection.",
