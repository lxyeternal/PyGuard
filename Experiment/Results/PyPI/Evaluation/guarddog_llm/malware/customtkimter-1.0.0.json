The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed during installation. This is a classic technique used to hide malicious payloads from static analysis and to evade detection. The use of exec() on decrypted code, especially in a package installation context, is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the target system. The obfuscated class name and nonsensical metadata further suggest an attempt to disguise the package's true purpose.",
