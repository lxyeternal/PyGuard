The payload is not visible in the source code, making its behavior intentionally hidden and obfuscated. This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and deliver malicious code at install time. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution. The package metadata (name, author, description) is also nonsensical, which is typical of malicious or typosquatting packages.",
