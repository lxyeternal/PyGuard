The command is only run if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command (when decoded) downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe', then runs it and deletes the file. This is a classic pattern for a trojan dropper or loader, which is highly malicious. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and misleading package metadata) further indicates intent to evade detection.",
