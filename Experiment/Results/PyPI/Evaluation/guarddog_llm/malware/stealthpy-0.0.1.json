After execution, it attempts to remove the evidence by deleting the temporary directory. This behavior is characteristic of a dropper or loader, which is a common malware technique for delivering and executing additional malicious payloads on a victim's machine. The use of Discord CDN for payload hosting, the creation of a suspiciously named directory, and the silent execution and cleanup all strongly indicate malicious intent.",
