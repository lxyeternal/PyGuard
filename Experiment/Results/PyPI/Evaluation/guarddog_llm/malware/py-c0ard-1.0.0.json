It defines a custom install command (GruppeInstall) that, when the package is installed on a Windows system, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload via exec(). The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of exec() on decrypted data is a common technique for hiding and executing malicious code (such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or remote access trojans). This behavior is triggered automatically during installation, making it especially dangerous and characteristic of supply chain attacks.",
