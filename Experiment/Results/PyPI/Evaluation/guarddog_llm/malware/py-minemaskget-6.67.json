The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated, but it downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe', then runs it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and executes additional malicious payloads. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates an attempt to hide execution from the user.",
