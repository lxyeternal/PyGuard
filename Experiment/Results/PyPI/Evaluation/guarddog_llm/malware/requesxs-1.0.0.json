It defines a custom install command (GruppeInstall) that, when the package is installed on a Windows system, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload via exec(). The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of encrypted, dynamically executed code during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common technique to hide and execute malware. The code is designed to run only on Windows, further suggesting targeted malicious behavior.",
