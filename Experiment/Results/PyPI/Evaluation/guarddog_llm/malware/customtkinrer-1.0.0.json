This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation. The use of encrypted payloads, obfuscated class names, and execution of arbitrary code during install are all strong indicators of malware, such as info-stealers, backdoors, or other forms of compromise. The package metadata is also suspiciously random, which is common in malicious packages.",
