The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic dropper/downloader behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and execute additional malicious payloads. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and EncodedCommand is a known technique to evade detection.",
