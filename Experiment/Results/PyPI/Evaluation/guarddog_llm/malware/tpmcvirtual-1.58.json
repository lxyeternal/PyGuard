      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' command. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its activity and execute potentially harmful commands without user knowledge. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a typical persistence or anti-analysis check. The use of 'WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' further indicates an attempt to avoid detection by the user. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0'), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then running it. This behavior is consistent with a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and executes additional malicious payloads.",
