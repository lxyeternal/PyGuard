It collects sensitive system information including the OS version, current working directory, network configuration, public IP address, username, and hostname. It then exfiltrates this data by sending it to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL using a curl command. The use of a custom install command in setup.py ensures this code is executed automatically when the package is installed, making it stealthy and effective for data exfiltration. This behavior is typical of information-stealing malware.",
