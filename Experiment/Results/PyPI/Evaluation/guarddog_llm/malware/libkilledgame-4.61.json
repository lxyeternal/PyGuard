      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is classic dropper/backdoor behavior, and the use of hidden execution and obfuscation further confirms malicious intent.",
