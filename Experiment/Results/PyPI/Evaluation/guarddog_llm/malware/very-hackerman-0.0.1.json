On line 5, it sends a POST request to a Discord webhook with a hardcoded message, which is a common exfiltration technique. More critically, it executes a large, obfuscated, base64-encoded payload via exec(). This payload, when decoded, contains further code execution and likely additional data exfiltration or backdoor logic. The use of double exec and base64 obfuscation is a hallmark of attempts to hide malicious intent. The package metadata (name, author, description) is also suspicious and likely intended to deceive users. This code is highly likely to be a credential stealer, backdoor, or similar malware.",
