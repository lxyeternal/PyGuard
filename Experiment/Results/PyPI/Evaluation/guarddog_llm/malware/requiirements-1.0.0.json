The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its true behavior and evade static analysis. The package name 'requiirements' is also suspiciously similar to 'requirements', which is a common typo-squatting technique to trick users into installing malicious packages.",
