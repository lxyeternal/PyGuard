The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation, making it difficult for static analysis tools to detect the true behavior. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and is a common method for running arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine. The package metadata is also obfuscated, and the code only triggers on Windows, further indicating targeted malicious intent.",
