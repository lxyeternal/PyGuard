The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), and the URL 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0' is present in the decoded command, indicating it downloads and executes a file from Dropbox. This is a classic indicator of a downloader or dropper, which is a common malware technique. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a well-known method to evade detection and run malicious payloads without user visibility. The rest of the code is a decoy (setup.py for a Python package), which is a common tactic to disguise malicious intent.",
