      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' command. This is a common technique used by malware to execute obfuscated or hidden commands on a victim's machine. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a typical anti-analysis or persistence check. The use of 'WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' further indicates an attempt to hide the execution from the user. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0'), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then running it, which is a clear sign of malicious behavior (downloading and executing remote code).",
