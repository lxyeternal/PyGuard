      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which hides the PowerShell window. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe', then runs it. This is a classic technique for delivering and executing malware on a victim's machine. The check for the existence of the 'tahg' file is likely used as a simple persistence or anti-redundancy mechanism. The use of distutils.setup is a decoy to make the file appear as a legitimate Python package setup script.",
