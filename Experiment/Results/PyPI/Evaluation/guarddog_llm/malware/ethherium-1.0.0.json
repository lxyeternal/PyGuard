The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, and the key is hardcoded. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation, making detection and analysis more difficult. The use of exec() on decrypted code is highly suspicious and is a common method for running arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine. The package metadata (name, author, etc.) is also suspicious and likely intended to mimic legitimate packages or evade detection.",
