The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making its intent and actions hidden from static analysis. This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation. The use of a misleading package name ('requeits', similar to 'requests'), random author information, and a suspicious long description further indicate an attempt to disguise the package as legitimate. This behavior is highly indicative of a malicious package designed to compromise systems during installation.",
