The code attempts to elevate privileges to administrator using Windows APIs. If not already running as admin, it relaunches itself with elevated privileges. Once running as admin, it downloads a file named 'image.png' from a remote server (http://wpp-api-01hw.onrender.com/api/images/1140884481671188581/image.png) using a custom header, writes it to disk, then reads and base64-decodes its contents and executes it as Python code using exec(). This is a classic pattern for a trojan dropper or loader, as it allows arbitrary code execution from a remote source during package installation, bypassing normal user scrutiny. The use of obfuscation (base64, remote code) and privilege escalation further confirms malicious intent.",
