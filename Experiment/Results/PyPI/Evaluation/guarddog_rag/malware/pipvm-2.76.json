      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in setup.py). Specifically, it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden and executed at install time, without user consent or notification. The use of subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded PowerShell command, especially with -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand, is a strong indicator of malware. This technique is used to evade detection, deliver and execute arbitrary code, and potentially establish persistence or exfiltrate data. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated payload delivery, hidden process execution, and execution of arbitrary code during package installation. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a benign Python package.",
