      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits several hallmarks of malicious behavior, particularly those associated with supply chain attacks. Specifically: (1) It overrides the setuptools install and develop commands to execute arbitrary code during package installation, a technique used exclusively in malware for supply chain compromise. (2) The execute() function downloads a remote batch file (install.bat) from a hardcoded, suspicious Discord CDN URL and immediately executes it using os.system, without any user interaction, validation, or notification. (3) There is no integrity or authenticity check on the downloaded file, allowing an attacker to deliver and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. (4) The use of 'set __COMPACT_LAYER=RunAsInvoker | start install.bat' may be an attempt to bypass UAC or escalate privileges on Windows systems. (5) The code is hidden in the installation process, meaning it will run automatically when the package is installed, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. (6) The package metadata and structure are generic and provide no legitimate reason for this behavior. All these factors, especially the combination of remote payload download and execution during install, are strong, exclusive indicators of malware.",
