      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the setup process of a Python package. Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and/or executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is highly indicative of a supply chain attack, as it leverages the package installation process to deliver and execute a remote payload without user consent. The use of obfuscation, lack of user notification, and execution of remote code are all strong indicators of malware. The code is also wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and evade detection.",
