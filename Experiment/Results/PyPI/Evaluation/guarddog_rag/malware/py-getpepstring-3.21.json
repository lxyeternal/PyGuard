      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory ('tahg'), and if not present, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command. The encoded command (base64) is passed to PowerShell with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a classic malware technique for stealthy execution. The decoded command downloads and/or executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then executes it. This is a textbook supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is executed during package installation (setup.py), without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python packages and supply chain attacks.",
