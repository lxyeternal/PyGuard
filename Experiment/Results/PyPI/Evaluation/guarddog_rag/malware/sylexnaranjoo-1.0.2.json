      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a fully functional Remote Access Trojan (RAT) targeting Windows systems, controlled via Discord. It exhibits multiple critical malicious behaviors: (1) It collects and exfiltrates sensitive data such as Chrome cookies, browser history, Discord tokens, and screenshots, sending them to an attacker-controlled Discord server. (2) It allows remote shell command execution with shell=True, enabling arbitrary code execution and system compromise. (3) It can trigger destructive actions such as forced shutdowns and blue screens (system crash) via remote commands. (4) It can manipulate the victim's system (e.g., change wallpaper, display fake error messages, control the webcam, take screenshots) without user consent. (5) It uses DPAPI decryption to steal Chrome credentials, a technique exclusive to malware. (6) It exfiltrates the victim's username, IP address, and system information to the attacker's Discord server. (7) It contains hardcoded Discord bot tokens, indicating the attacker's infrastructure. (8) It uses Discord as a C2 (command and control) channel, a common malware tactic to evade detection. (9) The code includes no legitimate user-facing features, documentation, or consent mechanisms. (10) The flagged line (requests.get to https://discord.com/api/v9/users/@me) is used to validate and enumerate stolen Discord tokens, a classic credential theft technique. All these behaviors are strong, exclusive indicators of malware, with no benign use case.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install hook (PostInstallCommand) that executes subprocess.run([\"python\", \"-m\", \"syntax\"]) during package installation. This means that, upon installation of the package (e.g., via pip), arbitrary code in the 'syntax' module will be executed automatically on the user's system, without their knowledge or consent. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution at install time. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute an unrelated Python module during installation, especially without user interaction or notification. The use of this pattern is observed exclusively in malicious samples and is never seen in benign software. The package metadata (name, author, description) also appears suspicious and does not indicate a legitimate, well-known project.",
