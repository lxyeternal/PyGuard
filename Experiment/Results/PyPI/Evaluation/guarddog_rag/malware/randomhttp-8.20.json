      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The command is base64-encoded and is run with -WindowStyle Hidden, which is a classic technique for stealthy execution of malicious payloads on Windows systems. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (the URL is obfuscated in the base64 string), likely without user consent or notification. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed during package installation or setup. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The code does not perform any legitimate setup logic before this execution, and the presence of this pattern is strongly associated with malware, as it enables remote code execution and potential system compromise.",
