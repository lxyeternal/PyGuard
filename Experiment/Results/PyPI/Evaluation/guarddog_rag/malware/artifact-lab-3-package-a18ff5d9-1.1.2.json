The exfiltration function notmalfunc is automatically executed during both the 'install' and 'develop' phases of the package installation process by overriding setuptools' install and develop commands. This means the data exfiltration occurs automatically and without user consent whenever the package is installed or developed, which is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The use of a suspicious, non-transparent external endpoint, the collection of sensitive environment data, and the automatic execution during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a package to exfiltrate environment variables in this manner, and this pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples.",
