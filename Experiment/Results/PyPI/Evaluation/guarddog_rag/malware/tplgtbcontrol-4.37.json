The encoded command is passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of arbitrary or attacker-controlled payloads. The command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs them. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of a try/except block to suppress errors further increases the stealthiness of the attack. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute remote binaries without user consent, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
