It collects sensitive system information (package name, hostname, current username, and current working directory) and exfiltrates it to an external, hardcoded domain (for-research.ru) via DNS requests. The exfiltration is triggered automatically during package installation, development, or egg_info commands by overriding setuptools command hooks. The use of DNS for covert data exfiltration, the lack of user notification or consent, and the embedding of this logic in installation hooks are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of malicious PyPI packages designed for host fingerprinting and tracking.",
