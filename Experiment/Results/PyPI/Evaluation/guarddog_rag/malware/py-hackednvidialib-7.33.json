      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is executed during the installation process (in the setup.py context), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the check for a suspiciously named directory ('tahg'), and the lack of any user-facing functionality or legitimate business logic further indicate malicious intent. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely downloads and/or executes additional payloads from a suspicious external domain (as hinted by the comment and the encoded string). This pattern is strongly associated with malware and is not found in benign software.",
