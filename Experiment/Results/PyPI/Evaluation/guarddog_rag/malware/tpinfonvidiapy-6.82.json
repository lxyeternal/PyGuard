      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command during the package setup phase. Specifically, if the 'tahg' directory does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution and payload delivery. The base64 payload decodes to a command that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a classic supply chain attack vector, as the code is triggered automatically during installation (via setup.py), without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign Python packages.",
