      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated, base64-encoded command. The command is passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for executing obfuscated or hidden payloads on Windows systems. The decoded command downloads and executes a remote file (likely a malicious executable) from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, as it runs automatically during package installation (setup.py), without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these characteristics match critical risk indicators for malware: remote code download and execution, obfuscation, lack of user interaction, and execution during install.",
