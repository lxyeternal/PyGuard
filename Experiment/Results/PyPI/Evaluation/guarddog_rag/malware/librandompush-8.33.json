      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the package installation process (in the setup.py script). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command is likely used to download and/or execute further code from a remote server (the encoded string contains a URL: 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0'), and saves or runs a file named 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence malware indicators: execution of obfuscated commands, use of external (non-corporate) infrastructure, execution during installation (supply chain attack vector), and lack of user notification or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases suspicion. This pattern is not found in benign software and is a hallmark of Python supply chain attacks.",
