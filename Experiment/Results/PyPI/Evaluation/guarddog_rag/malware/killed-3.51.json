Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is triggered during package installation, without user consent or notification, and is designed to download and execute arbitrary code from the internet. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All of these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
