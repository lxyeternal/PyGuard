      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains a custom setuptools install hook (new_install) that registers a _post_install function to be executed automatically after installation. The _post_install function collects sensitive system information: the external IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the local hostname (os.uname()[1]), and the current script path. It then encodes this information using base64 and sends it to an external, non-corporate domain (https://kotko.org) via an HTTP GET request. This exfiltration of host-specific data to a hardcoded, suspicious domain without user consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign software. The use of base64 encoding, lack of user notification, and execution during package installation further elevate the risk. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
