      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (i.e., in the setup.py script). Specifically, it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag. The base64-encoded command is obfuscated and likely downloads and/or executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0). This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the user's system during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated, encoded commands, hidden process windows, and suspicious external URLs is strongly associated with malware. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its behavior. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute such commands, making this a clear case of malicious behavior.",
