      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and executed with PowerShell's -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), specifically a file named 'Esquele.exe', and saves it to the user's home directory under 'WindowsCache.exe'. It then attempts to execute this file. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner, especially without user consent or notification.",
