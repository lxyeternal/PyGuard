      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. First, it uses base64 decoding followed by exec to dynamically execute obfuscated Python code at runtime, a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. Second, it checks for the existence of a suspicious directory (C:/ProgramData/Updater) and, if not present, downloads a ZIP file from an external, non-standard URL (https://transfer.sh/QuUD3Q/Updater.zip) using PowerShell, extracts it to a system directory, deletes the ZIP, and then executes further commands to install a wide range of Python packages and run additional scripts (including a .vbs launcher and a hidden Python server). These actions are performed without user consent or notification, target sensitive system locations, and use shell=True, increasing the risk of arbitrary code execution. The combination of obfuscation, remote payload retrieval, persistence mechanisms, and hidden execution is a classic pattern for malware, especially in the context of a Python package setup script (supply chain attack vector). There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a benign package setup script.",
