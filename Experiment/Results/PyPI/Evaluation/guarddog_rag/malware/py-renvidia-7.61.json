This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell commands to be executed without user knowledge. The command is triggered during the setup process (i.e., when the package is installed), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) in the encoded command suggests that it downloads and possibly executes additional payloads from an external source. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. All these behaviors—obfuscated command execution, external payload download, hidden execution, and error suppression—are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign Python packages.",
