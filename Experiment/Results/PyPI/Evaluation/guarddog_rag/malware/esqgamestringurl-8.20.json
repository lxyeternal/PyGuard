The PowerShell command is obfuscated and downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) without user consent or notification. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign software. The use of an encoded PowerShell command, hidden window execution, and remote payload retrieval and execution are all strong indicators of malware. The code is designed to run automatically upon installation, which is a common technique for malicious PyPI packages.",
