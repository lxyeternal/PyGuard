      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It overrides the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary, obfuscated, and encrypted code during package installation, specifically on Windows systems. The custom install class imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' (from the cryptography package), then uses Fernet to decrypt an encrypted payload and immediately executes the result with exec(). The payload is statically embedded and encrypted, making static analysis difficult and strongly indicating an attempt to hide its true behavior. This pattern—executing hidden, decrypted code at install time, especially in a package with a typosquatted name ('Matplrtib', similar to 'matplotlib') and no legitimate installation logic—is a textbook example of a supply chain attack. The use of obfuscated class names, suspicious author information, and the absence of any legitimate package functionality further reinforce the malicious nature. This behavior is never observed in benign packages and is a critical risk for remote code execution and system compromise.",
