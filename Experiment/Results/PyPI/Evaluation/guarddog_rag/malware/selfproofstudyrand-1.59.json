      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded payload. The encoded PowerShell command (EncodedCommand) is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the payload from static analysis and security tools. The command downloads and executes a file from an external, non-standard, and suspicious domain (github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then invokes it. This behavior is triggered during package installation (setup.py), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW ensures the process is invisible to the user, further indicating malicious intent. There is no user notification, consent, or validation of the downloaded file. All these characteristics match high-confidence indicators of malware, including remote code download and execution, obfuscation, and execution during installation.",
