      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed without user consent or visibility. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides its behavior. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and runs it, establishing a potential backdoor or delivering further malware. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and malicious PyPI packages, as it executes during installation (setup.py context) and is never seen in benign software.",
