It silently searches for the 'tdata' directory of the Telegram Desktop application in the user's APPDATA folder, collects all files and subdirectories matching specific patterns (which are known to contain Telegram session and authentication data), compresses them into a zip archive in memory, and then exfiltrates this archive via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Telegram bot API endpoint controlled by the attacker. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate reason for this behavior. The code is hidden in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of a hardcoded bot token and chat ID, the targeting of sensitive application data, and the immediate exfiltration to an external server are all textbook indicators of credential-stealing malware.",
