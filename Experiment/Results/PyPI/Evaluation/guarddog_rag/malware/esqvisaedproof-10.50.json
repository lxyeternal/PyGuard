      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (i.e., in the setup.py context). The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding and is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag to avoid user detection. The decoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where arbitrary code is executed on the victim's machine during package installation, enabling remote code execution, persistence, and potential data exfiltration. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign Python packages.",
