This is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and is likely used to download and execute a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), as indicated by the decoded base64 string. The use of subprocess.Popen with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution without user consent or notification. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and evade detection. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages.",
