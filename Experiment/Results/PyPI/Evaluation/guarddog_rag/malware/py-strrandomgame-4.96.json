      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command during the package setup process. Specifically, if the 'tahg' directory does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution and payload delivery. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is executed during package installation, potentially compromising the system without user consent or awareness. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute external binaries in this manner.",
