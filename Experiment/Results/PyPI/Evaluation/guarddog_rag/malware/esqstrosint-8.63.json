      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory ('tahg') and, if not present, spawns a hidden PowerShell process using an encoded command. The encoded command is base64-encoded and is executed with '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a well-known malware technique for stealthy execution. The decoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where arbitrary code is executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution, persistence, and potential data exfiltration. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware.",
