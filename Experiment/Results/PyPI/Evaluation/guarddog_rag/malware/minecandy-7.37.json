The encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from an external, non-transparent URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnytzbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: it abuses the Python package installation process to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote payload delivery are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is observed exclusively in malware.",
