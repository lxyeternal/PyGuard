      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and exhibits multiple critical risk indicators associated with supply chain attacks and remote code execution. Specifically: (1) The setup.py script overrides the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary code during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain malware. (2) The overridden install command imports 'requests' and 'fernet' dynamically and then uses Fernet to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). (3) The encrypted payload is hardcoded and obfuscated, making its intent hidden from static analysis and reviewers. (4) The code only runs on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), indicating targeted behavior. (5) There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate installation logic; the install hook is abused solely for payload execution. (6) The package name 'PyGaime' is a typosquat of 'pygame', a common malware distribution tactic. (7) The use of encrypted payloads, dynamic imports, and exec() is exclusively observed in malware samples and never in benign software. (8) The code is designed to evade detection and analysis, and could easily be used to download, execute, or install further malicious components, steal data, or establish persistence. All of these behaviors are textbook examples of Python supply chain malware.",
