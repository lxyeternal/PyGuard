It subclasses setuptools' install command to execute arbitrary code during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is immediately executed via exec(). The decrypted payload is not visible in the source, making it impossible to verify its intent, but this pattern is exclusively observed in malware. The use of obfuscated class names, lack of legitimate functionality, and execution of hidden code during install are all strong indicators of malicious behavior. This technique is commonly used to deliver secondary payloads, steal data, or establish persistence on victim systems, especially in malicious PyPI packages.",
