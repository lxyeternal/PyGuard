      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple, critical indicators of malicious behavior. First, it uses obfuscated variable names and a function (l111_cringe_) that decodes and dynamically executes code via eval, a classic obfuscation and code injection technique. Second, it executes shell commands using subprocess.getoutput to download and execute a remote shell script (aza.sh) from a suspicious, non-corporate GitHub URL, saving it as 'gay.sh', making it executable, and running it. This is done both before and after the setup() call, ensuring execution during package installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks). The use of __import__('subprocess') and obfuscated strings further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying these actions. The combination of dynamic code execution, remote payload download and execution, and obfuscation is exclusively observed in malware and is never present in benign software.",
