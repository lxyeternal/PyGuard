The encoded command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs them. This behavior is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of PowerShell in hidden mode, encoded commands, silent error suppression, and remote payload execution are all strong indicators of malware. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions.",
