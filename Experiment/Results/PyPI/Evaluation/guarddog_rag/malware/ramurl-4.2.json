      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command with a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py script). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery: it enables arbitrary code execution, remote payload download, and persistence, all without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware in the Python ecosystem.",
