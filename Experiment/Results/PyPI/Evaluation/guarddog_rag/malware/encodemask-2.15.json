      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the package installation process (in the setup.py script). Specifically, it checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then invokes it. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence indicators of malware: (1) execution of obfuscated commands, (2) downloading and running remote executables, (3) hiding execution from the user, (4) embedding this logic in a setup script to trigger on install (supply chain attack vector), and (5) lack of user notification or consent. These patterns are never observed in benign software and are strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
