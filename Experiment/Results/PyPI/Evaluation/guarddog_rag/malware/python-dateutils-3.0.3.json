      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation: several large base64-encoded strings, and the use of eval and compile to dynamically decode and execute code at runtime. The variable 'trust' is constructed by evaluating obfuscated strings, and then the code executes a base64-decoded payload using eval(compile(..., 'exec')). This pattern is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in supply chain attacks, as it allows arbitrary code execution during installation or import, bypassing static analysis. The code also imports modules commonly used for system interaction, network communication, and process control (e.g., os, requests, subprocess, sys, platform), and contains references to external URLs and webhooks, which are typical for data exfiltration or remote command and control. There is no legitimate reason for such obfuscation and dynamic code execution in benign software, especially in the context of package installation or import. The combination of these factors, all of which are exclusively observed in malware samples and never in benign code, makes this a clear case of malicious code.",
