It defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that, during package installation, checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet', and immediately executes code that is decrypted at runtime using Fernet. The encrypted payload is hardcoded and decrypted with a hardcoded Fernet key, then executed via exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious payload is hidden (encrypted) in the setup script and only executed during installation, allowing arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of dynamic imports, encrypted payloads, and execution during install time are all strong indicators of malware, especially as there is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality. This matches multiple critical risk indicators, including: execution of decrypted code at install time, use of hardcoded cryptographic keys and encrypted payloads, obfuscation of intent, and supply chain attack vector.",
