      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and executed with PowerShell's -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing potentially malicious payloads on Windows systems. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), specifically a file named 'Esquele.exe', and saves it to the user's home directory. It then attempts to execute this file. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code download and execution, use of obfuscated PowerShell commands, lack of user interaction or consent, and execution during package setup (supply chain attack vector). The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python-based malware, especially in supply chain attacks.",
