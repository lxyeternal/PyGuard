Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious code is triggered during package installation, is obfuscated via base64 encoding, downloads and executes a remote payload, and attempts to evade detection by hiding the PowerShell window. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
