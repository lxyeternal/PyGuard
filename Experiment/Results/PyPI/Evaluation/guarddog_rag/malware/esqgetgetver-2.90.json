This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell commands to be executed without user knowledge. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64-encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs them. This behavior is strongly associated with malware, especially supply chain attacks via Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, and the execution of code during installation (via setup.py) further confirm the malicious intent.",
