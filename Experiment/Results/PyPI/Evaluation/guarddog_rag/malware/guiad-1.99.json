      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated, base64-encoded command. The command is passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for executing obfuscated or hidden payloads on Windows systems. The decoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnytzbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks via Python package installation scripts. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner, and this behavior is never observed in benign software.",
