      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and executed with PowerShell's -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing potentially harmful payloads on Windows systems. The encoded command appears to download and/or execute a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a setup script, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
