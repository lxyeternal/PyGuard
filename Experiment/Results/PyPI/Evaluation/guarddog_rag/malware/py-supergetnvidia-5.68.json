The command is run only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding and is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag to avoid user detection. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: arbitrary code execution during package installation, obfuscated payload delivery, and remote code execution. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides malicious activity. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
