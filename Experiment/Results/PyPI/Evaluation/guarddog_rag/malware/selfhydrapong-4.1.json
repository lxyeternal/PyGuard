Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and/or executes content from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and writes or runs files in the user's environment, all without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the obfuscated payload, and the execution during package installation are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware targeting the software supply chain.",
