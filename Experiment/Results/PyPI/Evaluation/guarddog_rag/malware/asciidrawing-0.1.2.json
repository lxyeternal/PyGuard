In the _post_install_action method, it collects the user's home directory path (os.path.expanduser(\"~\")) and the current timestamp, then sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1286626910658494548/qIZzdJXpnm-6d4-DqFuDUGdTijE7AL46qqxK4R9vMxU_vYE2Wsm4ks4cgfGk0-Gz7eSF). This exfiltration of potentially sensitive user information to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint without user consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. The behavior is not justified by the package's stated functionality and is executed automatically during installation, making it highly malicious.",
