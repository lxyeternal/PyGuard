      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern embedded in what appears to be a setup.py file for a Python package. After a large block of whitespace (likely to evade casual inspection), the code checks if the OS is Windows, then proceeds to: (1) dynamically install the 'requests' library if missing, (2) download files from hardcoded, suspicious IP addresses (http://52.14.229.35:1122/connect-CANDC.txt and http://52.14.229.35:1122/shoomsha.jpg), (3) save these files locally, (4) rename them to .bat files, and (5) execute them using subprocess.Popen with shell=True. This sequence enables remote code execution, as the downloaded files could contain arbitrary commands or payloads. The code also attempts to clean up after itself by deleting the .bat files, and suppresses all exceptions to avoid detection. The use of hardcoded IPs, lack of user interaction or notification, execution of remote code during installation, and obfuscation via whitespace and exception suppression are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of malware, especially in supply chain attacks targeting Python package repositories.",
