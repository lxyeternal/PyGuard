The command is base64-encoded, which is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the payload. Decoding the base64 reveals that the PowerShell command downloads an executable ('Esquele.exe') from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a textbook supply chain attack: the code is triggered during package installation, downloads and executes a remote payload, and uses obfuscation and exception suppression to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples.",
