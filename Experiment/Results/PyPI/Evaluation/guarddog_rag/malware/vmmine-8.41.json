The encoded PowerShell command is not transparently visible in the code, which is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. The use of subprocess.Popen to launch PowerShell in hidden mode with an encoded command is a well-known method for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. This behavior is highly indicative of malicious activity, especially in the context of a Python package setup script, as it enables remote code execution on the victim's system without user consent or awareness. The try/except block further suppresses errors, which is another common tactic in malware to avoid detection and ensure execution. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign software.",
