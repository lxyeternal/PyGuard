Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and/or executes content from a suspicious external URL (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then attempts to execute it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is triggered during package installation, is obfuscated, contacts an external server, downloads and executes a potentially malicious binary, and suppresses all exceptions to evade detection. These behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
