The encoded command (Base64) is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the payload from static analysis and security tools. The decoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external domain (esquelesquad.000webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquadesquadax.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe', and then invokes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation (setup.py), enabling remote code execution, system compromise, and further malware deployment. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never present in benign software.",
