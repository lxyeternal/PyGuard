      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command during the package setup phase. Specifically, if the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from an external, non-transparent URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnytzbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is highly characteristic of supply chain attacks and malware delivery, as it enables remote code execution on the victim's system without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute an external binary in this manner.",
