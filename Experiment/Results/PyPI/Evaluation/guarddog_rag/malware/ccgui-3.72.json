The PowerShell command is provided as a long, base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing arbitrary commands or downloading/executing further payloads. This behavior is executed during the package installation process (in setup.py), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of a hidden window, obfuscated command, and silent error suppression (broad try/except) further indicate malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware, especially in Python package supply chain attacks.",
