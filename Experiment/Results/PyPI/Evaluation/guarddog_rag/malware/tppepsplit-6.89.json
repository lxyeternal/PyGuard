      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell commands to be executed without user knowledge. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64-encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs them. This behavior is strongly associated with malware, particularly supply chain attacks via malicious PyPI packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, and the execution of code during package installation further confirm the malicious intent.",
