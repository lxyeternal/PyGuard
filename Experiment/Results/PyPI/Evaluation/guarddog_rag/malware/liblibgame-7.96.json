      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command during the package setup process, specifically if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and executed with '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded shell commands; (2) downloading and executing code from an external source without user consent; (3) running during package installation (supply chain attack vector); (4) use of try/except to suppress errors and avoid detection; (5) lack of any legitimate business logic for such actions in a setup script. These patterns are exclusively observed in malware and are never present in benign software.",
