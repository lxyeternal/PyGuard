      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in setup.py). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden and executed at install time, without user consent or notification. The use of subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded PowerShell command, especially with the -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand flags, is a strong indicator of malware. The encoded command appears to download and execute a file from an external, non-standard domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a common technique for remote payload delivery. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages.",
