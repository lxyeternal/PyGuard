The payload is passed to PowerShell via the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious commands on Windows systems. The use of subprocess.Popen with PowerShell in hidden mode, combined with a base64-encoded command, is a hallmark of malware, especially in supply chain attacks via Python package installation scripts. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script. The rest of the file is a standard setup() call, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell execution is a critical indicator of malicious intent.",
