Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code, downloads and runs potentially malicious executables, and does so without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and external payload delivery are all strong indicators of malware. The try/except block suppresses errors, further hiding its activity. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware and supply chain attacks.",
