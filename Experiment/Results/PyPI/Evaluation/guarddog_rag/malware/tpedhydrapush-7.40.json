This is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution, often used to download and execute further payloads, establish persistence, or exfiltrate data. The use of subprocess.Popen with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a textbook indicator of malware, especially as it is triggered during package installation (setup.py context) and is obfuscated to evade detection. The code is wrapped in a broad try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection, another hallmark of malicious code. The encoded PowerShell command appears to contact an external domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), likely to download and execute additional malicious content. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or trojanized package.",
