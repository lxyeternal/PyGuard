      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem. Specifically: (1) It collects the victim's COMPUTERNAME environment variable and exfiltrates it to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is a classic system fingerprinting and data exfiltration technique. (2) It downloads a Windows executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and immediately executes it via os.system('start '+filename), enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. (3) All of this is triggered automatically during package installation by hooking into setuptools' install command (cmdclass={'install': PostInstallCommand}), a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (4) The code suppresses all exceptions, hiding errors and making detection harder. (5) There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation justifying these actions. These behaviors are never observed in benign software and are strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
