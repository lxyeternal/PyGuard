The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and encoded, which is a hallmark of malware delivery and execution. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the user's system during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious behavior. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a classic technique for delivering secondary malware or establishing persistence. All these behaviors are critical risk indicators and are never observed in benign software.",
