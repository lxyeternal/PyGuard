      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with the -EncodedCommand argument. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com), specifically a file named 'Esquele.exe', and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in the setup script, so it will run automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. All of these behaviors—obfuscated payload delivery, remote code execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during install—are strongly associated with malware and are never found in benign software.",
