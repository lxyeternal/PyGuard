      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern: during installation (in the setup.py script), it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg'. If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a well-known technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: execution of obfuscated code during installation, use of hidden PowerShell windows, downloading and executing remote payloads, and lack of user notification or consent. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python package supply chain malware.",
