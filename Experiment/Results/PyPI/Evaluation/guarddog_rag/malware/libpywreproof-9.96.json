      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation/setup phase of a Python package. Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a classic technique for delivering and executing obfuscated malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, enabling remote code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these characteristics are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
