      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: during installation (in the setup.py context), it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg'. If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command. The command is obfuscated and uses '-EncodedCommand', a well-known technique for hiding the true intent of the payload. The decoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise without user consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware distributed via PyPI or similar channels.",
