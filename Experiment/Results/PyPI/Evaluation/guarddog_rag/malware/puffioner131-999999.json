      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It abuses the Python package installation process by defining custom install and develop commands (PostInstallCommand and PostDevelopCommand) that automatically execute during package installation or development setup. In both cases, the code collects all environment variables from the victim's system (which may include sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, tokens, and other secrets) and exfiltrates them via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (http://eewtrzyimp165no1u4kqfhv0nrtih95y.oastify.com). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, commonly seen in malicious PyPI packages. The code runs without user consent or notification, and the exfiltration endpoint is not related to any legitimate business logic. There is no legitimate reason for a package to collect and transmit all environment variables to an external server during installation. This behavior is a strong indicator of credential-stealing malware and supply chain compromise.",
