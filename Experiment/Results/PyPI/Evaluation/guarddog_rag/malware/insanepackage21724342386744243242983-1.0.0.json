It defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that, during package installation on Windows systems, dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden and obfuscated, only revealed and executed at install time, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of encrypted payloads, dynamic imports, and execution during installation are all strong indicators of malware, especially as there is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality. The package name and metadata are also suspicious and non-descriptive, further supporting the malicious classification.",
