The encoded PowerShell command (base64) is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the payload. The command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgny.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: it leverages the package installation process to deliver and execute a remote payload, potentially compromising the system. The use of a hidden window, encoded command, and silent error suppression (broad try/except) are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner.",
