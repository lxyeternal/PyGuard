      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of credential-stealing malware. It programmatically locates and accesses sensitive browser and Discord data directories using environment variables (APPDATA, LOCALAPPDATA), then extracts and decrypts stored credentials (passwords, cookies, Discord tokens) from Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge, and Discord installations. The code writes these credentials to local files, then exfiltrates them to external attacker-controlled endpoints: a hardcoded Discord webhook and a Telegram bot API endpoint. The exfiltration is performed automatically, without user consent or notification, and the code attempts to delete the evidence files after exfiltration. The use of hardcoded webhooks, Telegram bot endpoints, and the automated collection and exfiltration of sensitive data are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying these actions. The code structure, error suppression, and endpoint usage match patterns seen exclusively in malware samples.",
