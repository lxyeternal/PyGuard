It automatically downloads a batch file from an external, hardcoded URL (https://frvezdff.pythonanywhere.com/getrnr) without user consent, writes it to the user's APPDATA directory, and then copies it to the Windows Startup folder to achieve persistence. This ensures the batch file will execute every time the user logs in, a classic malware persistence technique. Finally, the code forcibly reboots the system using os.system('shutdown /r /f'), which is disruptive and can be used to finalize infection or evade detection. The code runs these actions automatically upon import or execution, with no user interaction, notification, or legitimate justification. The use of a suspicious external domain, manipulation of the Startup folder, and forced reboot are all strong, exclusive indicators of malware, especially in the context of a Python package setup script.",
