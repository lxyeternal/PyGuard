This is done without user consent, logging, or legitimate business justification. The use of a hardcoded, non-corporate domain, the lack of user notification, and the execution of this logic during package installation are all hallmarks of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
