Specifically, it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered during package installation, is obfuscated via base64 encoding, downloads and executes a remote payload, and uses exception suppression to evade detection. The use of a hidden PowerShell window, encoded commands, and a non-corporate domain are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions.",
