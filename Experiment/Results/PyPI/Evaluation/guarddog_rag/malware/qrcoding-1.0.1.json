This behavior is highly suspicious and matches several critical risk indicators for malware: (1) it downloads and executes code from an external, non-transparent, and potentially attacker-controlled source without user consent or notification; (2) it does so automatically during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector; (3) there is no validation, signature checking, or user interaction before executing the downloaded code; (4) the remote URL is not a reputable or official package repository, but a file-sharing service, which is commonly abused for malware delivery. This pattern is strongly associated with malicious activity and is never observed in benign, reputable packages.",
