      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly indicative of malicious behavior and fits the pattern of a supply chain attack via a Python package. The setup.py script defines a custom install command (with an obfuscated, randomly generated class name) that, during installation, checks if the OS is Windows and then imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' (from the cryptography library). It then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This is a classic malware delivery technique: the actual malicious payload is hidden (encrypted) in the setup script, only revealed and executed at install time, bypassing static analysis. The use of exec() on decrypted data, the obfuscated class name, the lack of any legitimate package functionality, and the execution of code during installation without user consent are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples and is never present in benign code.",
