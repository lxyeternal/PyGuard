      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (i.e., in the setup.py context). Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is designed to run automatically when the package is installed, without user consent or notification, and downloads and executes remote code, which can lead to full system compromise. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
