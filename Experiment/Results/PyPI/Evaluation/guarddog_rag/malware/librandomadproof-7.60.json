The payload is base64-encoded and is executed with -EncodedCommand, which is a common technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious PowerShell scripts. The command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) without user consent or notification. This behavior is triggered during package installation (setup.py), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote code retrieval and execution are all strong indicators of malware. There is no legitimate reason for this code to exist in a setup script, and it matches multiple high-confidence malware patterns, including hidden process execution, obfuscated payload delivery, and remote code execution.",
