The command is base64-encoded and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the payload. The decoded command downloads and/or executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a textbook supply chain attack vector, as it will run automatically when the package is installed, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
