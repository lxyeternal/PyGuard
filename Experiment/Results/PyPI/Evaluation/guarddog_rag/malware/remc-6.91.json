      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed without user consent or visibility. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The base64-encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior is a hallmark of malware delivery and execution, especially in the context of a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and ensure execution. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute remote binaries in this manner.",
