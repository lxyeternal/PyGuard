The PowerShell command is obfuscated and, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote domain (dl.dropbox.com) using Invoke-WebRequest, saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and executing it. This behavior is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), silent error suppression, and hidden process execution are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is exclusively associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
