This sequence—downloading an external payload, writing it to disk, and executing it without user interaction or validation—is a textbook example of malicious behavior, commonly seen in malware and supply chain attacks. The code is hidden in what appears to be a package setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. There is no user notification, no integrity check on the downloaded file, and the external server is not a trusted or well-known source. The use of a broad exception handler further suppresses errors, aiding stealth. All these characteristics match critical risk indicators for malware.",
