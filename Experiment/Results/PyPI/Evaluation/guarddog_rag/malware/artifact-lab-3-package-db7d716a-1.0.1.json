It collects all environment variables from the system during the installation of a Python package (via a custom setuptools install command) and exfiltrates them to a hardcoded external server (https://ea2de72474be.ngrok.app) without user consent. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious behavior is triggered automatically during package installation, which is a critical risk vector. The environment variables may contain sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, and other secrets. The use of a custom install command to trigger this behavior, the lack of user notification or consent, and the transmission of sensitive data to a non-corporate, suspicious domain are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples and is never seen in benign software.",
