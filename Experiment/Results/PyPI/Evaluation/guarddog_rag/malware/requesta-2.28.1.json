      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior. The 'execute' function downloads a list of executables from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt), then downloads additional executables from the same server, writes them to disk, makes them executable (on Linux/macOS), and immediately executes them using os.system. This is a classic malware pattern: automated download and execution of remote payloads without user consent, error handling, or validation. The code is further embedded in wrapper functions (get, post, put, etc.) that mimic the requests API, ensuring that any HTTP request made through these functions will trigger the malicious payload download and execution. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or documentation justifying this behavior. The use of a direct IP address, lack of integrity checks, and immediate execution of untrusted code are all hallmarks of malware, especially in supply chain or dependency confusion attacks.",
