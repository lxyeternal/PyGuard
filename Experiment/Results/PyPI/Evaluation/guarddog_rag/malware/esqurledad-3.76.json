      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (i.e., in the setup.py script). The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding and is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which suppresses any visible window, a common technique used by malware to evade user detection. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns associated exclusively with malware, including: (1) execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands, (2) downloading and executing remote payloads, (3) execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector), (4) use of try/except to suppress errors and evade detection, and (5) lack of user notification or consent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and the combination of these behaviors is a hallmark of Python supply chain attacks.",
