      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed without user consent or visibility. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe', and then invokes them. This behavior is a hallmark of malware: it downloads and runs remote executables, likely as part of a supply chain attack (since this code is embedded in a setup script). The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and all observed patterns match those found exclusively in malware samples.",
