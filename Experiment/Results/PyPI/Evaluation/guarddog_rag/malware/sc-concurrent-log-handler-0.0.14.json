      "malicious_behavior": "The code in the CustomInstall class's run() method constructs a shell command that downloads and executes a remote shell script from https://down.threatest.com/uploads/install.sh using wget and bash. This command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via os.system('echo %s|base64 -d|bash' % encoded). This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior: it downloads and executes code from an external, hardcoded URL during the package installation process, without user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding is a common obfuscation technique to evade static analysis. This is a high-risk supply chain attack vector, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system at install time, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute remote code in this manner.",
