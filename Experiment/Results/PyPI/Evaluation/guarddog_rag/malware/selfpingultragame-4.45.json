      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed without revealing its intent in the source code. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides failures or detection. The encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, appears to download or execute a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (discordapp[.]com/attachments/...), which is a strong indicator of malware delivery or remote code execution. Embedding this logic in a setup script means it will run automatically during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
