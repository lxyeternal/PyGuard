Specifically, it checks for the absence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if not present, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered during package installation, is obfuscated via base64 encoding, uses hidden execution, and downloads and runs a remote executable without user consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its behavior. All these are strong, exclusive indicators of malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
