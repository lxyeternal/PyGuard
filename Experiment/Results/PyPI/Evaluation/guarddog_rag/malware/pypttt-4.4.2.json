      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. Specifically: (1) It collects the COMPUTERNAME environment variable (host identification) and exfiltrates it to an external, suspicious domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php) without user consent. (2) It downloads a Windows executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr) and writes it to disk as 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe', then immediately executes it via os.system('start '+filename), again without user interaction or notification. (3) These actions are triggered automatically during the package installation process by overriding the setuptools install command (cmdclass={'install': PostInstallCommand}), which is a classic supply chain attack vector. (4) The code uses a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. (5) The downloaded executable is from a non-standard, suspicious domain and is not verified or validated, increasing the risk of arbitrary code execution. (6) There is no legitimate application logic or user-facing functionality; the code's sole purpose is to exfiltrate data and execute a remote payload. All of these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign Python packages.",
