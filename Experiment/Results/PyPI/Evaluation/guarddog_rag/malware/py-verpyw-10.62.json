This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior is a hallmark of malware: it downloads and executes a remote payload without user consent, uses obfuscation to evade detection, and is triggered during package installation (setup.py), making it a supply chain attack vector. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
