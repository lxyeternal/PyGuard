It abuses the Python package installation process by defining a custom install command (via the 'cmdclass' argument in setup()) that executes arbitrary, hidden code during installation. Specifically, the custom install class 'DdpDHZvzGHpVLiyLqkdshcnFfEVMTnINCMkfVuTRRaniSscfhJkihNmkCwzvcSUxFTGfWnyrIWcsNoKoGRP' imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts and immediately executes (via exec) an encrypted payload. The payload is not visible in the source, is encrypted with Fernet, and is only decrypted and executed at install time, which is a classic supply chain attack pattern. This technique is strongly associated with malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscated class names, lack of legitimate package functionality, and execution of hidden, encrypted code during install are all critical risk indicators. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a benign package.",
