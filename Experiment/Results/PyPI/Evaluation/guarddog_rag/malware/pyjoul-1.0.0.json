      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (InstallCommand) that, during package installation, executes obfuscated code. Specifically, it contains a long, obfuscated string and a numeric key, which are XORed together to reconstruct a hidden Python payload. This payload is then executed using eval(compile(..., 'exec')), a classic technique for hiding and running arbitrary code. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides its behavior. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed on the victim's machine during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further compromise. There is no legitimate reason for a package install script to execute dynamically reconstructed, obfuscated code in this manner.",
