The encoded command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as a file (Esquele.exe) in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: it abuses the package installation process to deliver and execute arbitrary code from an attacker-controlled server. The use of obfuscation, silent execution, and error suppression further indicate malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never present in benign software.",
