The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code, fetches a potentially malicious executable from a remote server, and runs it in a stealthy manner (hidden window, no user notification). The use of obfuscation, silent error suppression, and execution of remote code are all strong indicators of malware. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python package malware.",
