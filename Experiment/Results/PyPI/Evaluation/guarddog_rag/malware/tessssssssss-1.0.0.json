Specifically, during installation, it collects sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, and username) and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, attacker-controlled domain (burpcollaborator.net, commonly used for security testing and exfiltration). This is done without user consent or notification, and the endpoint is not associated with any legitimate application functionality. The use of a custom install hook to perform data exfiltration is a critical risk and is never observed in benign software.",
