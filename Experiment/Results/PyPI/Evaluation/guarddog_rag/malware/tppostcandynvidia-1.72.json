      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory ('tahg') and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command (base64) is passed to PowerShell with the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing potentially harmful payloads on Windows systems. The command downloads and executes a remote file (likely a malicious executable) from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware: it downloads and executes code from the internet without user consent, uses obfuscation to evade detection, and attempts to hide its execution. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware.",
