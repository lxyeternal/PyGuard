      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if not present, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using an encoded command. The encoded command (base64) is a well-known obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is highly indicative of a supply chain attack, as it executes during package installation (setup.py), without user interaction or consent, and is designed to stealthily download and run additional malicious code. The use of a hidden window, encoded command, and silent error suppression (broad try/except) further confirms the intent to evade detection and analysis. All these patterns are exclusively observed in malware and never in benign software.",
