It overrides the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary, obfuscated, and encrypted code during the installation process, specifically on Windows systems. The custom install class imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' (from cryptography), then decrypts and executes a payload using exec() on a hardcoded encrypted blob. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden from static analysis, only runs on install, and is executed without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution (exec) is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in typosquatted or suspicious packages. There is no legitimate reason for a setup.py to execute encrypted code during installation, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
