      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory ('tahg'), and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and executed in hidden mode, which is a classic malware technique for stealthy payload delivery, remote code execution, or further compromise. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and/or executes a payload from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgny.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, specifically a supply chain attack or trojanized package, as it executes arbitrary code on the victim's machine during installation or setup, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python-based malware, especially in the context of malicious PyPI packages.",
