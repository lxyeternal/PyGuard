In the try block, it attempts to import the subprocess module, and if not present, installs it using os.system, which is itself suspicious. More critically, it then executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.run that downloads an executable (Oxzy.exe) from a suspicious Dropbox URL and saves it as WindowsCache.exe in the user's home directory, then immediately executes it. This is a classic malware delivery pattern: downloading and running a remote payload without user consent, with no validation, logging, or legitimate business logic. The use of a try/except block to suppress all errors further hides failures and evades detection. Embedding this logic in a setup.py file means it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
