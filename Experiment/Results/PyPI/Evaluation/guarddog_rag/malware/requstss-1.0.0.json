It defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that, during package installation, checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet', and immediately executes code that is decrypted at runtime using Fernet. The encrypted payload is hardcoded and decrypted with a hardcoded Fernet key, then executed via exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious code is triggered automatically during installation, is obfuscated via encryption, and can perform arbitrary actions on the victim's machine. The use of misleading package name ('requstss', a typo of 'requests'), lack of legitimate business logic, and the presence of dynamic code execution during install are all strong indicators of malware. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of Python package supply chain attacks.",
