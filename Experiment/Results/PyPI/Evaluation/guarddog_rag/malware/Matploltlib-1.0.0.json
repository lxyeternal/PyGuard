It abuses the Python package installation process (via a custom install command in setup.py) to execute arbitrary, hidden code on the victim's machine during installation. Specifically, the custom install class (with an obfuscated name) checks if the OS is Windows, then imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', and immediately decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet. The payload is not visible in the source code, making its intent and actions completely opaque to the user or reviewer. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, commonly seen in malicious PyPI packages. The use of strong obfuscation (random class names, encrypted payload, no documentation, no user notification, and no legitimate package functionality) is a hallmark of malware. The package name 'Matploltlib' is a typosquat of the popular 'matplotlib', further indicating malicious intent to trick users. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute hidden, encrypted code during installation.",
