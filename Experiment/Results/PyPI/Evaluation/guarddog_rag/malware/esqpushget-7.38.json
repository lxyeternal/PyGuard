The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote, hardcoded domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is embedded in a setup script (setup.py) to execute during package installation, without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, remote payload retrieval, and silent error suppression (broad try/except) are all strong indicators of malware. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system and can lead to further compromise, data theft, or persistence.",
