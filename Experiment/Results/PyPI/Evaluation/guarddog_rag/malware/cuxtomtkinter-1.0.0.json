      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It subclasses setuptools.command.install to execute arbitrary code during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The custom install class dynamically imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' only at runtime (to evade static analysis), then uses Fernet decryption with a hardcoded key to decrypt and immediately exec() an obfuscated payload. This is a classic malware pattern: the payload is hidden from static analysis, only revealed and executed on install, and the use of exec() on decrypted data allows for arbitrary code execution. The code is further obfuscated by using random class names and meaningless metadata. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute hidden, encrypted code during installation, especially without user consent or transparency. This matches multiple critical risk indicators for Python malware, including supply chain attack vectors, dynamic code execution, runtime decryption, and abuse of the install hook.",
