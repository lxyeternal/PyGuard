      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command using subprocess.Popen. The encoded command is passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of arbitrary or malicious payloads. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the activity. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the lack of any legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script strongly indicate this is a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never found in benign software.",
