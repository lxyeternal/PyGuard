      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the setup process of a Python package. Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and executing potentially malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and/or executes content from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and writes to or executes files in the user's environment, all without user consent or notification. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, where arbitrary code is executed during package installation, potentially compromising the system. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. These patterns are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
