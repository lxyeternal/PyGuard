      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed on the victim's machine without user consent or visibility. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command appears to download and/or execute content from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0), and writes it to a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence indicators of malware: obfuscated payload delivery, remote code execution, use of suspicious external infrastructure, execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector), and evasion techniques. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides malicious activity. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions.",
