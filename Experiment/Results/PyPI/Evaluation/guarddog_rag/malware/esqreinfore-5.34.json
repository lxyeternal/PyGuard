This is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution, often used to download and execute further payloads or establish persistence. The use of subprocess.Popen with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution without user interaction or notification. The base64-encoded command is obfuscated, making it difficult to immediately determine its purpose, which is another hallmark of malware. The code is wrapped in a try/except block that silently suppresses errors, further hiding its behavior. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a textbook example of a supply chain attack or installer-based malware.",
