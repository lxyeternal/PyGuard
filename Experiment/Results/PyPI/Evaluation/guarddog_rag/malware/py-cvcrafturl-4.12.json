      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command during the package setup phase. Specifically, if the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious code is triggered during installation (via setup.py), downloads a remote executable, and runs it without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign Python packages.",
