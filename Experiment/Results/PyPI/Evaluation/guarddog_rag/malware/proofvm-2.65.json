Specifically, if the 'tahg' file or directory does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and executing potentially malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9yzbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then invokes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is triggered during package installation, downloads a remote executable, and runs it without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and external payload delivery are all strong indicators of malware, and there is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a setup script.",
