This behavior is executed automatically during the package installation process, without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded external IP, the collection of environment details, and the lack of legitimate business logic or user interaction are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware, as it leverages the package installation process to perform unauthorized data exfiltration.",
