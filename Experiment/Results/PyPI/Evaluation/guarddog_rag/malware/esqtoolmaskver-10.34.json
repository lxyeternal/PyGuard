      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py script). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery: it downloads and runs an untrusted executable from the internet without user consent, using obfuscation and stealth (hidden window, encoded command, try/except to suppress errors). The use of a try/except block to suppress all exceptions further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
