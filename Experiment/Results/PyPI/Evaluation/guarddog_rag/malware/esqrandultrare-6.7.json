      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the setup process of a Python package. Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command decodes to a script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern: it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code on the user's system without consent, downloads and runs a remote executable, and uses obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window) to evade detection. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. All these characteristics are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
