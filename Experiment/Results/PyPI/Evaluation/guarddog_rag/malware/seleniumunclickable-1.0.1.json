      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It subclasses the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary code during package installation. Specifically, it downloads a remote Python file (qrcodegen.py) from a hardcoded, non-standard, and obfuscated URL (https://transfer.sh/4gecNG/qrcodegen.py) using the requests library, writes it to disk, and immediately executes it using subprocess with the current Python interpreter. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign software. The code is obfuscated to evade detection (e.g., splitting and joining strings to construct the URL), and there is no integrity check, user notification, or legitimate reason for this behavior. The downloaded code could contain any payload, including further malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines. This is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malware.",
