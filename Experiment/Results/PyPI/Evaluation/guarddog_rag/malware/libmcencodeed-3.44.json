      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory ('tahg'), and if not present, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using an encoded command. The encoded command (base64) is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the payload. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation (setup.py). The use of subprocess.Popen with PowerShell in hidden mode, encoded commands, and silent error suppression (broad try/except) are all strong indicators of malware. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script. The code is designed to stealthily download and execute further payloads, potentially compromising the system.",
