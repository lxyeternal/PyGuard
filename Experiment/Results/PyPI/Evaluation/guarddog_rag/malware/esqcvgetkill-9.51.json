      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if not present, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using an encoded command. The encoded command (Base64) is passed to PowerShell with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of arbitrary or malicious payloads. The command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This behavior is a textbook example of a supply chain attack or installer-based malware: it executes a hidden, obfuscated payload during package installation, without user consent or notification, and is designed to evade detection. The use of a try/except block to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign code.",
