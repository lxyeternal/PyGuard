The encoded command is passed to PowerShell with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The decoded command downloads and/or executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery: it downloads and executes a remote payload, bypassing user awareness and security controls. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples.",
