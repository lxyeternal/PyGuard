If so, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a well-known technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then invokes it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware: it downloads and executes a remote binary without user consent, uses obfuscation to evade detection, and is triggered during package installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks). The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions.",
