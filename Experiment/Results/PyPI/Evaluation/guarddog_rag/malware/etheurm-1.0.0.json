      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (via cmdclass in setup.py) that executes arbitrary, encrypted Python code during package installation. Specifically, the run() method of the custom install class checks if the OS is Windows, then dynamically imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code with exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never seen in benign software. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution during installation is a strong indicator of malware. The package name 'etheurm' is also suspiciously similar to 'ethereum', suggesting typosquatting. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute encrypted, hidden code at install time, especially with no user interaction or documentation.",
