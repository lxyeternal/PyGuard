The command is base64-encoded and executed with '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a classic technique for stealthy execution of malicious payloads on Windows systems. The decoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it, all without user consent or notification. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation or setup. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and remote payload retrieval and execution are all strong indicators of malware. The rest of the code is a standard setup.py stub, likely to disguise the malicious payload.",
