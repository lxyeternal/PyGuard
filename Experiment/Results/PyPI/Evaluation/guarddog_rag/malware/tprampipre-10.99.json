      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is provided in base64-encoded form via the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing arbitrary or malicious payloads on Windows systems. The decoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence malware indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded shell commands; (2) downloading and executing code from an external source without user consent; (3) use of hidden PowerShell windows to evade user detection; (4) execution during package setup, a common supply chain attack vector. The code is further obfuscated by suppressing errors with try/except and provides no legitimate user-facing functionality in the suspicious block. All these factors strongly indicate malicious intent.",
