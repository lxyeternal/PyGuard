Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and/or executes content from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com) and writes or runs files in the user's environment. This behavior is highly indicative of a supply chain attack, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and external network communication to a non-corporate domain are all strong indicators of malware. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its activity.",
