      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks in Python packages. Specifically: (1) It collects the COMPUTERNAME environment variable (host identification) and exfiltrates it to an external, suspicious domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php) without user consent. (2) It downloads a Windows executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), writes it to disk as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and immediately executes it via os.system('start '+filename), all without user interaction, validation, or notification. (3) These actions are triggered automatically during the package installation process by overriding the setuptools install command (cmdclass={'install': PostInstallCommand}), ensuring the payload runs as soon as the package is installed. (4) The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further hiding its activity. (5) The package name 'fuzzywuzy' and the description are generic, which is a common tactic in typosquatting and malicious package campaigns. All of these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign Python packages.",
