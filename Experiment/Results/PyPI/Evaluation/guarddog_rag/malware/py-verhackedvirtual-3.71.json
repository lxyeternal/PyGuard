      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it imports subprocess and os, checks for the absence of a file named 'tahg', and then executes a PowerShell command in hidden mode using an encoded (base64) payload. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it, then attempts to run 'WindowsCache.exe'. This is a classic supply chain attack technique, where malicious code is executed during package installation (setup.py), with no user interaction or notification. The use of PowerShell with -EncodedCommand, hidden window, and remote payload download/execution is a textbook example of malware delivery and execution. The code is obfuscated, suppresses errors with a broad try/except, and is not related to any legitimate installation logic. All these behaviors are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign code.",
