      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks and Python malware. Specifically: (1) It collects the COMPUTERNAME environment variable (host identification) and exfiltrates it to an external, suspicious domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation), which is a classic reconnaissance and exfiltration step. (2) It downloads a Windows executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr) and writes it to disk as 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe', then immediately executes it via os.system('start '+filename) without user consent, which is a textbook malware delivery and execution pattern. (3) All of this is triggered automatically during package installation by hijacking the setuptools install command (cmdclass={'install': PostInstallCommand}), meaning the malicious actions occur as a side effect of installing the package, without user awareness. (4) The code uses a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. (5) The package metadata (name '1337z', version, description) is generic and does not justify the network or execution behavior. These behaviors are never observed in benign packages and are strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of supply chain attacks via Python package repositories.",
