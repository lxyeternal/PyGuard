The command is base64-encoded and, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) using PowerShell. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: it abuses the package installation process to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine without user consent. The use of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell payloads, hidden process execution (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), and remote code retrieval are all strong indicators of malware. This behavior is never observed in benign Python packages and is a hallmark of malicious PyPI packages designed to compromise systems during installation.",
