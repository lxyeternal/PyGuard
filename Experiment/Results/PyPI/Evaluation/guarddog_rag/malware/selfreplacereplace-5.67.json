The encoded command is passed to PowerShell with the -EncodedCommand flag and -WindowStyle Hidden, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The decoded command downloads and/or executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
