      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscated and stealthy code execution. The base64-encoded payload decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it, then invoking another executable ('WindowsCache.exe'). This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded commands; (2) downloading and executing code from an external, attacker-controlled source; (3) running this logic automatically during package installation (setup.py), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks; (4) use of try/except to suppress errors and avoid detection; (5) lack of user interaction, consent, or notification. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
