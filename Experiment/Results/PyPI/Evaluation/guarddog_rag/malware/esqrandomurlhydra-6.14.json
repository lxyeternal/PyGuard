The PowerShell command is run with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand', which is a classic malware technique for stealthy execution of arbitrary or malicious code. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious URL (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This behavior is highly indicative of a supply chain attack: the code is designed to run automatically during installation (via setup.py), without user consent or notification, and downloads and executes a remote payload. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and remote code download/execution are all strong indicators of malicious intent, and there are no legitimate reasons for such behavior in a package setup script.",
