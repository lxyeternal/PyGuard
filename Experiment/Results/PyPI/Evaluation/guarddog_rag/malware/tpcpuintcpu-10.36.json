      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a highly obfuscated PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is provided as a long base64-encoded string, which is a classic technique for hiding the true intent of the payload and evading static analysis. The command is run with '-WindowStyle Hidden', ensuring it is invisible to the user, and uses '-EncodedCommand', which is almost exclusively seen in malware for stealthy execution of secondary payloads, remote code, or further system compromise. The encoded payload appears to download and/or execute a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or malicious package, especially as it is placed in a setup script that will run automatically during installation.",
