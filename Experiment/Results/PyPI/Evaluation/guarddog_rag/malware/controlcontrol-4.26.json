      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious payloads on Windows systems. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' ensures the process is invisible to the user, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The encoded command appears to download and/or execute a file from a remote server (the base64 string decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and runs an executable from a suspicious domain). This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery via Python package installation scripts. The use of try/except to suppress errors and the lack of user notification or consent further reinforce the malicious intent.",
