      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (i.e., in the setup.py context). The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding and is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which is a classic indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the execution from the user. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where arbitrary code is executed on the user's system during package installation, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware installation. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
