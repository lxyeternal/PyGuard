      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is provided as a long, base64-encoded string, which is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the payload from static analysis and security tools. Decoding the base64 reveals that the command downloads and executes a remote executable from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in a setup script, so it will execute automatically during package installation, without user consent or awareness. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors—obfuscated payload delivery, remote code execution, hidden process spawning, and lack of user interaction—are strongly associated with malware and are never found in benign Python packages.",
