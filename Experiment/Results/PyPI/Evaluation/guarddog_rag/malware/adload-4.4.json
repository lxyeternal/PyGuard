      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command during the installation process (in the setup.py script) if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and is run with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which are classic indicators of obfuscated and stealthy execution. Decoding the base64 payload reveals that it downloads an executable ('Esquele.exe') from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9yzbub0qm/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is triggered during package installation, downloads and executes a remote payload, and uses obfuscation and exception suppression to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and all observed behaviors (obfuscated command, remote download, execution, stealth, and lack of user notification) are strongly associated with malware.",
