      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the setup process if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for hiding the true intent of the command and is strongly associated with malware. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code download and execution, obfuscation via base64 encoding, execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector), and lack of user notification or consent. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will run automatically upon package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem.",
