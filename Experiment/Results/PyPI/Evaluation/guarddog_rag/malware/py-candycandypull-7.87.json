      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory ('tahg'), and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and executed in hidden mode, which is a classic technique for stealthy malware delivery and execution. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and/or executes a payload from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware: it downloads and runs an external executable without user consent, uses obfuscation to evade detection, and attempts to hide its execution. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware.",
