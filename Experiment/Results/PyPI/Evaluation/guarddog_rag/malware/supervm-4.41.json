Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware.",
