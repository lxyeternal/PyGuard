It writes a Python script to a temporary file that, when executed, downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/bjhtk/raw) using exec(). The code then attempts to execute this temporary file using a modified Python executable name (replacing .exe with w.exe), which is a known evasion technique. The use of exec() on remote content enables arbitrary code execution, a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. The code is embedded in a setup.py file, meaning it will execute during package installation, further increasing the risk. The try/except block suppresses all errors, hiding failures and making detection harder. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
