It abuses the Python package installation process by defining a custom install command (CustomInstallCommand) that collects sensitive system information (public IP address, hostname, current working directory) without user consent and exfiltrates it to a hardcoded, suspicious external server (https://hj4r3z33cahfqit5kmmh1mgn3e95x4lt.oastify.com) via an HTTP POST request. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware, as it runs automatically during package installation, without user interaction or notification. The use of a non-standard, likely attacker-controlled domain, and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, further confirm the malicious intent. This pattern is consistently associated with malware and is never observed in benign software.",
