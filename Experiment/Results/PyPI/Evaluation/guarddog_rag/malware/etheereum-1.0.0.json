Specifically: (1) The setup.py script defines a custom install command (blMkxRVuVfpHMflcZuaWTUrGAOonbNBNosEnyeXTxFHYascoOPaKAOyeqOwZ) with an obfuscated name, which is a common tactic in malware to evade detection. (2) During installation, it conditionally imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and immediately executes an encrypted payload using Fernet and exec. The payload is not visible in the source code, making its intent opaque and preventing static analysis. (3) The use of Fernet encryption to hide the payload, combined with dynamic code execution (exec), is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages. (4) The code runs automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification, and is not related to any legitimate package functionality. (5) The package name ('etheereum') is a typosquat of 'ethereum', a common technique in supply chain attacks. (6) There is no legitimate reason for this code to decrypt and execute hidden payloads at install time. All these factors, especially the encrypted payload and dynamic execution, are exclusive to malware and never found in benign packages.",
