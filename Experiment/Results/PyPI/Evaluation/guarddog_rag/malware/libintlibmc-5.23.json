The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file (likely a malicious payload) from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior is highly indicative of a dropper or loader malware. The code is triggered automatically when the 'tahg' directory does not exist, and is placed in a setup.py-like context, meaning it will execute during package installation or build, without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscation (base64-encoded PowerShell), hidden execution, and remote payload delivery are all strong indicators of malicious intent, matching multiple critical risk patterns observed exclusively in malware.",
