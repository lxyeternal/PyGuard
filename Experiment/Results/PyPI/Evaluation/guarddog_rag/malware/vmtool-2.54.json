The command is obfuscated and decoded at runtime, which is a classic malware technique to evade detection. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from an external, non-transparent URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnytzbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation (setup.py). The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate reason for this behavior in a package setup script. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, and are never observed in benign software.",
