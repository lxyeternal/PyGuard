The encoded PowerShell command (base64) is a classic obfuscation technique used to evade detection and deliver or execute a secondary payload. The command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (the decoded command references a suspicious URL: http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnytzbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0 and saves it as WindowsCache.exe, then executes it). This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation (setup.py), without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never found in benign software.",
