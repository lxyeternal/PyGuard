It then exfiltrates this data to an external server (http://pt.traktrain.com/req.php) via an HTTP POST request. This pattern—gathering host, user, and file system information, including the contents of /etc/passwd, and sending it to a remote endpoint—is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. The code is embedded in what appears to be a Python package setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and the absence of user notification, logging, or error handling further supports the malicious classification.",
