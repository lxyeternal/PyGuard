      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command with a base64-encoded payload during package installation (in the setup.py context). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and/or executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and attempts to run it, as well as another executable (WindowsCache.exe) from the user's home directory. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, enabling remote code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute remote binaries in this manner.",
