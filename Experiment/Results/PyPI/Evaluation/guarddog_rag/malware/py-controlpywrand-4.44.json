The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as a file (Esquele.exe, WindowsCache.exe) in the user's home directory. This behavior is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: it leverages the installation process to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated, encoded commands, silent error suppression, and execution of remote code are all strong indicators of malware. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is exclusively associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
