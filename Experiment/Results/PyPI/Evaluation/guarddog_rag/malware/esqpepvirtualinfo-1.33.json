      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the package installation process (in the setup.py script). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns associated exclusively with malware, including: (1) execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands, (2) downloading and executing remote payloads, (3) hiding process windows to evade user detection, (4) embedding this logic in a setup script to trigger during package installation (supply chain attack vector), and (5) suppressing all exceptions to avoid detection. There is no legitimate reason for a Python package to perform these actions during installation, and the combination of these behaviors is a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks.",
