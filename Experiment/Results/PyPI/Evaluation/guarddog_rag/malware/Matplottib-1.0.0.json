      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and exhibits multiple critical risk indicators associated with supply chain attacks and malware. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command that executes arbitrary, encrypted code during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (2) The payload is encrypted with Fernet and immediately decrypted and executed via exec(), which is a classic obfuscation and payload delivery technique used exclusively in malware. (3) The code only runs on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), indicating targeted behavior. (4) The use of non-descriptive, obfuscated class and variable names, as well as the lack of any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, further supports the malicious intent. (5) The package name 'Matplottib' is a typosquat of the popular 'matplotlib', a common tactic in malicious PyPI packages. (6) The inclusion of 'requests' and 'fernet' as dependencies, and the dynamic import and execution of code, are strongly associated with credential theft, data exfiltration, or remote code execution. (7) There is no user notification, consent, or documentation for the code execution, and the decrypted payload is not visible for review, making it impossible to determine the full extent of the malicious actions without further analysis. All these factors, especially the execution of decrypted code at install time, confirm this is a malicious package.",
