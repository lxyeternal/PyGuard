      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It abuses the Python package installation process by defining a custom install command (via the 'cmdclass' argument in setup()) that executes arbitrary, hidden code during installation. Specifically, the custom install class imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts and immediately executes (via exec) an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and ciphertext. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious payload is hidden (encrypted), only revealed and executed at install time, and the code is obfuscated with random class and variable names. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate reason for this behavior. The use of Fernet decryption and exec in a setup script is a critical indicator of malware, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python package malware.",
