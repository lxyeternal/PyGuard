      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior. (1) It collects sensitive system information (the COMPUTERNAME environment variable) and exfiltrates it to an external, suspicious domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. (2) It automatically downloads a Windows executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and immediately executes it via os.system('start '+filename) without any user interaction, validation, or notification. This is a textbook pattern for remote code execution and payload delivery, commonly seen in malware and supply chain attacks. (3) The malicious logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command (PostInstallCommand), ensuring that the payload is executed automatically during package installation, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem. (4) The code uses a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. (5) The package name 'pyinstaler' is a typosquat of the legitimate 'pyinstaller', further suggesting malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user-facing functionality present; the code's sole purpose is to exfiltrate data and execute a remote payload.",
