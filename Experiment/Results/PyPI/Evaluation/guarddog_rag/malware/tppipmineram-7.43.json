The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated, but the use of '-EncodedCommand' and the presence of a suspicious, non-corporate URL (dl.dropbox.com) strongly indicate that it downloads and/or executes a remote payload. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is exclusively observed in malware samples. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection, and it is triggered during package installation, which is a critical risk vector for malicious code delivery.",
