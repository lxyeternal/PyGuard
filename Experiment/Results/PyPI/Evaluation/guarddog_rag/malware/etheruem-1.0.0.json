It abuses the Python package installation process by defining a custom install command (via setuptools' cmdclass) that executes arbitrary, encrypted code during installation. Specifically, the class WOGJKNvaVGDkdDpfFcLlbmcruPSrqNQHhZhwEKktiUqAVKGYUYvGqbrRIzhzdZVTqIdZqzEdrYwrvUOUzxTCtlkUCbgwZpjDVJaukIkjjDqWSoOeklGtnOnuvSlJBmo overrides the run() method to import requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes a hidden payload using Fernet decryption and exec. The payload is only executed on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), which is a common evasion technique. The use of strong obfuscation (random class name, encrypted payload, dynamic exec), lack of any legitimate package functionality, and execution of hidden code at install time are all hallmarks of supply chain malware. This pattern is never seen in benign packages and is a critical risk for arbitrary code execution and potential system compromise.",
