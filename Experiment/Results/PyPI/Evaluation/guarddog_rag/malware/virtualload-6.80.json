      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py file). Specifically, if the 'tahg' file or directory does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and executing potentially malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
