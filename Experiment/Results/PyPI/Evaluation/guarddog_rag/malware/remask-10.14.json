      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py script). Specifically, if the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64 string decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then invokes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is triggered during package installation, is obfuscated, downloads and executes a remote binary, and does so without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
