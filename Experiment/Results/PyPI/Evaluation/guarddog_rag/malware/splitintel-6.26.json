      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (i.e., in the setup.py script). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64 string decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is triggered during package installation, is obfuscated, downloads and executes a remote payload, and uses exception suppression to hide errors. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
