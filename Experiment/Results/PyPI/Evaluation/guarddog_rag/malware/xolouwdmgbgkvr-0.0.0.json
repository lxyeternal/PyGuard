      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a classic example of an information-stealing malware (specifically a Roblox cookie stealer). It performs the following malicious actions: (1) It uses the browser_cookie3 library to extract the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie from multiple browsers without user consent, which allows an attacker to hijack the victim's Roblox account. (2) It collects the victim's public IP address via an external service (https://api.ipify.org/), which is a common fingerprinting and tracking technique. (3) It uses the stolen cookie to query Roblox APIs for sensitive account information (username, Robux balance, account age, etc.). (4) It exfiltrates all of this data, including the sensitive cookie and IP address, to a hardcoded Discord webhook, which is a common command-and-control (C2) exfiltration method in modern malware. (5) The code is designed to run without user interaction or consent, and it attempts to evade detection by suppressing exceptions and providing a dummy loading message. All of these behaviors are strongly associated with credential theft and data exfiltration malware, and there is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality present.",
