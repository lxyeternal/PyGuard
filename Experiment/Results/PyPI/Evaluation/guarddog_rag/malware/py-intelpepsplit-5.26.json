The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (esquelesquad.000webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquad.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then invokes it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: it abuses the package installation process to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell commands, hidden window execution, and silent error suppression are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code is not related to any legitimate installation logic and is designed to evade detection and deliver a secondary payload.",
