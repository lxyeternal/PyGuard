The encoded command is not transparently visible, and the code attempts to hide its actions by running PowerShell in hidden mode and suppressing errors with a try/except block. The command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation or setup, potentially compromising the system. The use of obfuscation, lack of user interaction, and execution of remote code are all strong indicators of malware.",
