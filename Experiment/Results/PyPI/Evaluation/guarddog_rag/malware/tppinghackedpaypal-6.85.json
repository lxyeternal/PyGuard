If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic malware technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or remote code on the victim's machine without user consent. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, which is a strong indicator of intent to hide the true behavior from static analysis and users. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides failures or detection. The suspicious package name, author, and email, as well as the presence of a comment referencing a suspicious domain (esquelesquad.rip), reinforce the malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware, especially in supply chain attacks targeting Python package installations.",
