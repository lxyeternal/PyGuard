The payload is passed to PowerShell via the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious commands on Windows systems. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com), specifically a file named 'Esquele.exe', and attempts to run it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute an external binary in this manner, especially without user consent or notification.",
