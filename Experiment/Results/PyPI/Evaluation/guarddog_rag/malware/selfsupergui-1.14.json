The command is obfuscated and is executed automatically during the package setup process if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered during installation (setup.py), runs without user consent or notification, and the PowerShell command is both hidden and encoded to evade detection. The encoded command downloads and/or executes further payloads from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com), as indicated by the decoded base64 string. This behavior is strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks, and there is no legitimate reason for such actions in a setup script. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion.",
