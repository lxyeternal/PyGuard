      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks and Python malware. Specifically: (1) It collects the COMPUTERNAME environment variable (host identification) and exfiltrates it to an external, non-standard domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is not associated with any legitimate package functionality. (2) It downloads a Windows executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), writes it to disk as 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe', and immediately executes it via os.system('start '+filename) without any user notification, validation, or consent. (3) All of this is triggered automatically during package installation by embedding the behavior in a custom setuptools install hook (PostInstallCommand), ensuring the payload runs as soon as the package is installed. (4) The code is silent (errors are suppressed), lacks documentation, and provides no legitimate user-facing functionality. These patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign Python packages. The combination of data exfiltration, remote payload download, and execution during install is a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks.",
