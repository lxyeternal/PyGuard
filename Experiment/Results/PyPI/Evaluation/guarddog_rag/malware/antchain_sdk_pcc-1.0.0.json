It defines a custom installation command (CustomInstall) for a Python package, which is executed automatically when the package is installed (via pip or setup.py). During installation, it collects sensitive system information: the hostname, current working directory, and username of the user running the installation. It then exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io), which is commonly used for out-of-band data collection and is not related to any legitimate package functionality. This behavior is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and dependency confusion attacks, where malicious code is executed during package installation to steal information or establish a foothold. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate reason for this data collection and exfiltration. The use of a custom install command to perform these actions is a well-known malware technique, and the code matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior.",
