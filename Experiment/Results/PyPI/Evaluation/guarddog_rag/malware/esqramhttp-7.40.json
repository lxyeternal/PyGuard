      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (i.e., in setup.py). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and attempts to run it, as well as another executable (WindowsCache.exe) from the user's home directory. This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns: executing obfuscated shell commands, downloading and running remote executables, using hidden windows to evade user detection, and embedding this logic in a setup script to trigger on package installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks). There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and the code is designed to evade detection (e.g., by suppressing exceptions and hiding the process window).",
