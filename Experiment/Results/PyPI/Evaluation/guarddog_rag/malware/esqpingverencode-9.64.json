      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a file ('tahg'), then spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated, base64-encoded command. The command is decoded and executed by PowerShell in hidden mode, which is a textbook technique for stealthy code execution and payload delivery. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware: it enables remote code execution, payload delivery, and persistence, all without user interaction or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and Python package malware.",
