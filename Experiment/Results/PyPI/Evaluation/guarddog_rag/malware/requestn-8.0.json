      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior. It enumerates all files in the current working directory and, for each file, sends it as a document to a hardcoded Telegram bot via the Telegram Bot API, using a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. This is a classic data exfiltration technique, where potentially sensitive files are silently sent to an attacker-controlled Telegram account without user consent or notification. The code also sends a message to the same Telegram bot, likely as a marker or notification of execution. There is no legitimate user interaction, authentication, or input validation. The use of requests to send local files to an external service, especially with hardcoded credentials, is a strong indicator of information-stealing malware. The code structure, lack of documentation, and silent operation further reinforce its malicious nature.",
