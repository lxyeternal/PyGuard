      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen during package installation (in the setup.py context). The command is base64-encoded and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, a classic obfuscation and evasion technique. Decoding the base64 reveals that the PowerShell command downloads an executable ('Esquele.exe') from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a textbook supply chain attack: the code is triggered automatically during installation, without user consent or notification, and downloads and executes a remote payload. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
