      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command (CustomInstall) that is executed automatically during package installation. In its run() method, it collects sensitive host information (hostname, current working directory, username) and encodes it using base64. It then establishes an outbound TLS connection to a hardcoded, suspicious domain (d4d.one) and sends the encoded data via an HTTP GET request. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this data exfiltration. The use of a try/except block to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware, as it exfiltrates host-specific data during installation without user knowledge.",
