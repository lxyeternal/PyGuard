It subclasses setuptools' install command to execute arbitrary code during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. Specifically, in the custom install class, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern (exec(Fernet(...).decrypt(...))) is a critical risk and is observed exclusively in malware samples. The payload is hidden and obfuscated, and its execution is triggered automatically upon installation, without user consent or notification. The use of encrypted, hidden payloads, obfuscated class names, and execution in install hooks are all strong indicators of malware. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a benign package.",
