The encoded command downloads and executes a remote executable (Esquele.exe) from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks via Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user interaction or notification, and the obfuscation of the payload via base64 encoding further confirm the malicious intent. The code is designed to run automatically during package installation or setup, which is a high-risk vector for supply chain compromise.",
