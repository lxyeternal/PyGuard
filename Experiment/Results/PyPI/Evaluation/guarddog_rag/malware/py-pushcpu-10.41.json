      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command during the setup phase of a Python package. Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in the setup script, so it will run automatically when the package is installed, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, remote payload download, and execution of an external binary are all strong indicators of malware. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its behavior. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions.",
