If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic malware technique for obfuscating and delivering a secondary payload, often used to download and execute additional malicious code, establish persistence, or exfiltrate data. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, the obfuscated payload, and the execution of code during installation are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack. The code is not part of any legitimate business logic and is designed to evade detection and analysis.",
