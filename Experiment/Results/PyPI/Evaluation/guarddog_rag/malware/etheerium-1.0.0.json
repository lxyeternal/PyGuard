It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, during installation (i.e., when a user runs pip install), executes a block of code that is both encrypted (using Fernet symmetric encryption) and obfuscated. The payload is decrypted at install time and executed via exec, which allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The use of strong encryption (Fernet), random and non-descriptive class names, and the absence of any legitimate package functionality are all hallmarks of supply chain attacks and Python malware. The code only runs on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), further indicating targeted behavior. The decrypted payload is not visible in the source, making it impossible to audit what actions will be performed, but this pattern is exclusively observed in malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate reason for this behavior.",
