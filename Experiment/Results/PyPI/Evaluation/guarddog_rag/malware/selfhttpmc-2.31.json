      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is provided as a long, base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The decoded command downloads and/or executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware: it downloads and executes a remote binary without user consent, uses obfuscation to evade detection, and runs during package installation (setup.py), which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these characteristics match critical risk indicators for Python malware and supply chain attacks.",
