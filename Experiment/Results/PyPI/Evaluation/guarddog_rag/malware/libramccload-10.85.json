The command is base64-encoded and obfuscated, which is a classic malware technique to evade detection. The decoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) without user consent or notification. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign Python packages. The use of subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW ensures the process is hidden from the user, further indicating malicious intent. The code is triggered automatically during installation, which is a critical risk pattern for malware delivery.",
