The payload is obfuscated and executed without user consent or notification, and the command is run with the 'Hidden' window style to evade detection. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and/or executes content from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a classic malware delivery and remote code execution technique. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. The use of obfuscated, encoded payloads, hidden process execution, and external network communication during install time are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
