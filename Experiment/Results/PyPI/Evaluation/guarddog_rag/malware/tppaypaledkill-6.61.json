The base64-encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. All these behaviors—obfuscated command execution, remote payload download, execution during installation, and error suppression—are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
