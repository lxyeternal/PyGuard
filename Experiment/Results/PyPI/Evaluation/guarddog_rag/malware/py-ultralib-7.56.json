      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory ('tahg'), and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated, base64-encoded command. The command is passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for executing obfuscated or hidden payloads on Windows systems. The base64 string decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and/or executes a remote payload from an external domain (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and likely executes them. This is a classic supply chain attack vector, as the code is embedded in a setup script and will run automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
