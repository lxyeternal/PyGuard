      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a classic example of an information-stealing malware, specifically a Discord token and credential stealer. It exhibits multiple critical risk behaviors: (1) It searches for and extracts Discord tokens from various browsers and Discord installations, then validates them by making authenticated requests to Discord's API. (2) It steals Chrome browser passwords and cookies by decrypting them using the Windows DPAPI (win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData), which is a hallmark of credential theft malware. (3) It takes a screenshot of the victim's desktop. (4) It collects system and geolocation information (IP, city, region, country) via an external service (ipinfo.io). (5) It exfiltrates all collected data, including credentials, tokens, and screenshots, to a hardcoded Discord webhook controlled by the attacker. (6) It attempts to persist or reinfect Discord installations by modifying files in the Discord application directories. (7) It includes anti-detection and evasion techniques, such as suppressing exceptions and cleaning up after itself. (8) There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for these actions. All of these behaviors are exclusively observed in malware and are never present in benign software.",

It collects system information (hostname, IP address, username), writes the stolen data to a file in the user's Documents folder, and then exfiltrates this information to an external Discord webhook (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1063615699760713768/nxosUxZi-XxvD3oH97BKB3lQbF5li6A6oVbqXrut-pyyQRZr_FTSXKFqVAbYlkMkHZYo) without user consent. The process repeats every 3 hours, enabling ongoing data theft. The use of browser_cookie3 to extract cookies, the targeting of a sensitive authentication cookie, the hardcoded external webhook, and the lack of any user-facing functionality or consent are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches known information-stealing malware.",
