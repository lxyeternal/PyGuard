      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed on the victim's machine without user consent or visibility. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides the behavior. The encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and runs it, establishing a potential backdoor or delivering further malware. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign software. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, making it especially dangerous.",
