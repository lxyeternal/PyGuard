It connects to a hardcoded external host (6.tcp.eu.ngrok.io) and port, redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to the socket, and spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i). This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of a hardcoded, non-corporate domain, lack of user interaction, and direct shell execution are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a hallmark of remote access trojans (RATs) and backdoors.",
