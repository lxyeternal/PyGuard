The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic malware technique for stealthy payload delivery and execution, commonly seen in supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware. The use of obfuscated, encoded commands, silent execution, and remote payload retrieval is never observed in benign software and is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, further increasing the risk.",
