      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks and Python malware. Specifically: (1) It collects sensitive system information (the COMPUTERNAME environment variable) and exfiltrates it to an external, suspicious domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation), which is a classic reconnaissance and data exfiltration step. (2) It downloads a Windows executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr) and writes it to disk as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', then immediately executes it via os.system('start '+filename) without user consent, which is a hallmark of remote code execution and payload delivery. (3) All of this is triggered automatically during the package installation process by hijacking the setuptools install command (cmdclass={'install': PostInstallCommand}), meaning the malicious actions occur as soon as the package is installed, without user awareness. (4) The code uses a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. (5) There is no legitimate application logic or user-facing functionality; the code's sole purpose is to exfiltrate data and execute a remote payload. These patterns are exclusively observed in malware and supply chain attacks, and there are no benign use cases for this combination of behaviors.",
