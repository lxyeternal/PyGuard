      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: (1) It is heavily obfuscated, using lambda functions, non-descriptive variable names, and dynamic code execution via eval and exec. (2) It decodes and decompresses a base64-encoded, zlib-compressed payload, which is then executed dynamically. (3) The code uses multiple layers of indirection to hide its true functionality, including constructing code from integer lists and executing it via eval. (4) The code executes code at import time, without any user interaction or consent, and does not provide any legitimate functionality or documentation. (5) The presence of dynamic code execution on decoded and decompressed data is a textbook indicator of malware, as it allows arbitrary code to be run on the victim's machine, bypassing static analysis and detection. (6) The code structure and obfuscation techniques match those found exclusively in malware samples, with no benign use cases. (7) The code includes a suspicious, obfuscated payload (the long base64 string) that is decoded and executed, which is a common method for delivering secondary malicious payloads or establishing a backdoor.",
