      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a classic example of an information-stealing malware (infostealer) targeting Discord tokens and user data. It searches for Discord and browser LevelDB files in AppData/LocalAppData directories, extracts potential Discord tokens using regex, validates them by making authenticated requests to the Discord API, and collects associated user information (email, phone, billing status). It then exfiltrates this sensitive data to an external server via a Discord webhook, which is base64-encoded to evade detection. The code also collects the victim's public IP address. The use of hardcoded paths to sensitive directories, automated token extraction and validation, data exfiltration to a non-corporate domain, and obfuscation (base64 encoding of the webhook URL) are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic present.",

      "false_positive_reason": "The code only retrieves the public IP address of the host using requests.get('https://api.ipify.org/').text and returns it. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, code execution, persistence, or any other suspicious or malicious behavior. The code does not send the IP address to any third party, nor does it perform any further processing, encoding, or obfuscation. While contacting an external service to obtain the public IP can be a component of malicious code, in isolation and without subsequent exfiltration or suspicious use, this pattern is also common in benign software (e.g., for diagnostics, logging, or network configuration). The code lacks other risk indicators such as obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or interaction with sensitive files. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
