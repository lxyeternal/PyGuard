Specifically, it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered during package installation, is obfuscated, downloads and executes remote payloads, and attempts to evade detection by hiding the PowerShell window and suppressing all exceptions. These behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign Python packages.",
