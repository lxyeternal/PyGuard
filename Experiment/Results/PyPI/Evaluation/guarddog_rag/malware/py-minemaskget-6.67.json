Specifically, it checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The base64-encoded command decodes to a script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious code is triggered during package installation, is obfuscated via base64 encoding, and downloads/executes a remote payload without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
