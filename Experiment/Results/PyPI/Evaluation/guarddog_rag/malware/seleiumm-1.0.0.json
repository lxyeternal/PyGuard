The setup.py script defines a custom install command (with an obfuscated, randomly generated class name) that, during installation, checks if the OS is Windows and then dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This is a classic malware delivery pattern: the actual malicious payload is hidden (encrypted) and only revealed and executed at install time, bypassing static analysis. The use of exec on decrypted data, the obfuscated class name, the lack of any legitimate package functionality, and the execution of arbitrary code during installation (without user consent or notification) are all definitive hallmarks of Python malware, especially in the context of supply chain attacks via PyPI or similar package repositories.",
