The base64-encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a strong indicator of malware, as it enables remote code execution and potential system compromise during package installation. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification or consent, and the execution of this logic in a setup script (supply chain attack vector) further confirm malicious intent. All these behaviors are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign software.",
