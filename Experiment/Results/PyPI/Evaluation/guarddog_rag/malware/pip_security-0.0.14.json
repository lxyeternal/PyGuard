      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple high-confidence indicators of malicious behavior, specifically those associated with supply chain attacks and privilege escalation. The setup script defines a CustomInstallCommand that, upon installation, executes several shell commands via os.system: (1) it copies a compiled binary (pip_security) to /usr/local/bin/rootkit, (2) it executes the binary with an 'install' argument, and (3) it launches a background process named 'rootkit'. These actions are performed automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification, and target a privileged system directory (/usr/local/bin), which is a classic persistence and privilege escalation technique. The use of the name 'rootkit' is itself highly suspicious, as rootkits are a class of malware designed for stealthy persistence. The code does not provide any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify these actions. The combination of compiling, copying, executing, and backgrounding a binary during install is a hallmark of malicious Python packages observed in real-world supply chain attacks.",
