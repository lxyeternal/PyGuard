      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded PowerShell command (base64) is a classic obfuscation technique used to evade detection and deliver or execute a secondary payload. The command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external domain (esquelesquad.000webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquadesquadax.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then invokes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation (setup.py), without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors—obfuscated payload delivery, remote code execution, hidden process spawning, and lack of user interaction—are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
