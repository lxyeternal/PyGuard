It defines a custom setuptools install command (CustomInstallCommand) that, during package installation, downloads a remote Python file ('rat.py') from a suspicious, non-official URL (a Discord CDN link) and writes it to disk. The code then ensures the 'requests' and 'pycryptodome' packages are installed, which are commonly used in malware for network communication and cryptography. Critically, the downloaded file is named 'rat.py', which is a common abbreviation for 'Remote Access Trojan', a type of malware. The code is executed automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. There is no validation, integrity check, or legitimate business logic for downloading and running remote code in a setup script. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and is never seen in benign software.",
