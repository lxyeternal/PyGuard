      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly indicative of malicious behavior and matches multiple critical risk patterns associated with Python supply chain attacks. Specifically: (1) The setup.py script overrides the install command to execute arbitrary code during package installation, a classic vector for supply chain malware. (2) The code imports Fernet and requests, and then uses Fernet to decrypt an encrypted payload at install time, immediately executing the decrypted code with exec. This is a hallmark of obfuscated malware delivery, as the actual payload is hidden from static analysis and only revealed at runtime. (3) The class and variable names are heavily obfuscated, and the package metadata (name, author, description) is nonsensical, which is typical of malicious packages attempting to evade detection or masquerade as legitimate software. (4) The code only runs the payload on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), indicating targeted behavior. (5) There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation, and the only purpose of the code is to execute a hidden, encrypted payload during installation. (6) The use of setup_requires to pull in 'fernet' and 'requests' further supports the intent to decrypt and potentially exfiltrate data or download further payloads. All of these factors, especially the use of Fernet decryption and exec in an install hook, are exclusive to malware samples and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
