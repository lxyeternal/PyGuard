It recursively scans the filesystem, including sensitive directories such as '/storage/emulated/0' and '/sdcard/DCIM', for files with extensions .py, .php, .zip, .png, .jpg, and .jpeg. It then exfiltrates these files and their metadata (file name and path) to a hardcoded Telegram bot via the Telegram Bot API, using hardcoded bot credentials and chat IDs. The code uses multi-threading to speed up the exfiltration process and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic for this data transfer. The use of Telegram as a C2/exfiltration channel, targeting of user and system files, and lack of user consent are all strong indicators of malware, specifically information-stealing malware.",
