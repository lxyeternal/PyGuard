      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a file ('tahg'), and if not present, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The encoded command (base64) is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the payload. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation (setup.py), with no user interaction, notification, or consent. The use of a hidden window, encoded command, and silent error suppression (broad try/except) further indicate malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
