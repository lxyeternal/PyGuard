      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a PowerShell command in hidden mode using an encoded command string. The encoded command is passed to PowerShell via the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially harmful payloads. The command downloads and executes a remote file (likely a malicious payload) from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnytzbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks: it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without user consent, using obfuscation and stealth techniques (hidden window, encoded command). The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote executable in this manner.",
