It defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a classic indicator of malware: (1) it executes arbitrary, obfuscated code at install time without user consent, (2) the payload is hidden via encryption, making static analysis difficult, (3) the use of misleading package and author names (e.g., 'BeaitifulSoup', a typosquat of 'BeautifulSoup'), and (4) the code is only triggered on Windows systems, a common targeting technique. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute hidden, decrypted code during installation, and this pattern is never observed in benign software. This is a textbook example of a malicious PyPI package designed for supply chain compromise.",
