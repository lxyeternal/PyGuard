      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed without revealing its intent in the source code. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate URL (github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then invokes it. This behavior is a hallmark of malware: it downloads and runs a remote executable, likely as part of a multi-stage attack. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
