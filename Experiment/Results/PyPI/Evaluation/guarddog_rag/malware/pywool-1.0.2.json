      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains a highly suspicious and strongly malicious pattern: it defines a custom setuptools install command (CustomInstallCommand) that, during package installation, decrypts a large obfuscated payload (wopvEaTEcopFEavc) using a hardcoded key (iOpvEoeaaeavocp) and then immediately executes the resulting code using eval(compile(...)). This is a classic supply chain attack vector, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the target system at install time, without user consent or notification. The payload is heavily obfuscated, making its intent deliberately hidden, which is a hallmark of malware. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is consistently associated with malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages. The use of dynamic code execution (eval/compile) on decrypted data, triggered during installation, is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malicious behavior.",
