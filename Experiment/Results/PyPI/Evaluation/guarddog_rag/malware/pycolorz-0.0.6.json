      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits several hallmarks of malicious behavior, particularly those associated with supply chain attacks via Python packages. After the standard setuptools setup, the code creates a temporary file containing a Python script that downloads and executes code from an external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/39kv9/raw) using exec. It then attempts to launch this script using a potentially renamed Python executable (pythonw.exe) via os.system, which would execute the downloaded code without a console window, making detection harder. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code during package installation, without user consent or notification, and using obfuscated variable names—is a classic indicator of malware, especially in the context of malicious PyPI packages. The use of exec on remote content is extremely dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.",
