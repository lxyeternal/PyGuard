      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It abuses the Python package installation process by defining a custom install command (CustomInstall) that executes automatically when the package is installed. During installation, it collects sensitive system information, including the hostname, current working directory, username, and directory listings of critical system paths such as '/', '/root/', '/home/', and '/root/.ssh/'. It then exfiltrates this information via an HTTP POST request to an external, attacker-controlled domain (https://j0j0.xyz/lists/). The code attempts to create a file in '/root/', which may be used as a marker or for persistence. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate reason for this data collection and exfiltration. The use of a suspicious external endpoint, the collection of sensitive directory contents (including potential SSH keys), and the execution of this logic during package installation are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack and malicious intent.",
