This is a hallmark of malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, making it difficult to immediately determine its intent, but this technique is widely used to download and execute further payloads, establish persistence, or exfiltrate data. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the check for a suspiciously named file ('tahg'), and the lack of any legitimate business logic further confirm malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
