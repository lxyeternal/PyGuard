This occurs automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded, non-legitimate external endpoint, the collection of environment data, and the execution of this logic in a setup script are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack or information-stealing malware. This pattern is exclusively observed in malicious Python packages and is a hallmark of credential-stealing or reconnaissance malware.",
