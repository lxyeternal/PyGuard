The encoded command is base64-encoded PowerShell, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of arbitrary or malicious payloads. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a textbook indicator of malware, as it allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without user interaction or visibility. The code is wrapped in a try/except block that silently suppresses errors, further hiding its behavior. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with supply chain attacks, credential theft, remote code execution, and system compromise. The malicious code is executed during the installation process (setup.py), which is a common vector for supply chain attacks in Python packages.",
