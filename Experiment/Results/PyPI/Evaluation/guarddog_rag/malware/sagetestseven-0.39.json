      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and exhibits multiple critical risk behaviors associated with malware and supply chain attacks. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command that executes arbitrary code during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (2) It creates directories in the Windows Startup folder and another suspiciously named folder ('Powerpoint') under the Start Menu, which is a classic persistence mechanism to ensure code runs on system startup. (3) It clones two remote GitHub repositories into these sensitive locations, one of which is named 'defonotagrabber' (suggesting data theft), and the other 'test2lmaos'. (4) It moves a Python file ('test.py') into the Startup folder, ensuring it will be executed automatically. (5) It executes a downloaded executable ('main.exe') from the cloned repository, which is a direct remote code execution vector. (6) All of these actions are performed without user consent, notification, or legitimate business logic, and are triggered automatically during package installation. (7) The use of hardcoded, non-corporate GitHub URLs, suspicious author information, and lack of documentation further support the malicious classification. These behaviors are never observed in benign software and are strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
