The encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it, then invokes another executable ('WindowsCache.exe'). This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded payloads at install time, (2) downloading and executing code from an external, attacker-controlled source, (3) use of PowerShell in hidden mode to evade detection, (4) lack of user consent or notification, (5) use of try/except to suppress errors and avoid detection, and (6) presence in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a benign package, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware.",
