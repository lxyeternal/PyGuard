The command is base64-encoded and obfuscated, and it downloads and executes a remote payload from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered automatically on install, without user interaction or consent, and is designed to evade detection by hiding the PowerShell window and encoding the command. The use of a non-standard, attacker-controlled domain, obfuscated payload delivery, and execution of remote code are all strong indicators of malware. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python package malware.",
