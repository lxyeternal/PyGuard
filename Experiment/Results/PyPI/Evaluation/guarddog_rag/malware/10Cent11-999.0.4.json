It defines a custom setuptools install command (CustomInstall) that, when the package is installed, creates a reverse shell to a hardcoded external IP address (104.248.19.57) on port 3334. It redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to the socket, and then spawns a shell (/bin/sh) using pty.spawn. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine as soon as the package is installed, without any user interaction or consent. The use of a suspicious package name, lack of legitimate functionality, and execution of code during installation are all hallmarks of supply chain attacks and Python malware. There is no legitimate reason for a package install script to open a remote shell in this manner.",
