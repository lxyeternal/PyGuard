      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as the actual command is hidden from static analysis and can perform arbitrary actions on the victim's system. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The PowerShell command appears to download and/or execute a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then running it. This behavior is a hallmark of malware: it downloads and executes a remote payload during package installation, without user consent or notification, and uses obfuscation to evade detection. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks in Python packages and is never seen in benign software.",
