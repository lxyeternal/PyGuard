      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed without user knowledge. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides the behavior. The encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it, then attempts to invoke another executable ('WindowsCache.exe'). This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, as the code is embedded in a setup script and will run automatically during package installation, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. All of these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
