      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command during the package setup process, but only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command is passed to 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...', which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution from the user. The encoded command appears to download and/or execute a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code download and execution, obfuscation via base64 encoding, hidden process execution, and lack of user consent or notification. The code is placed in a setup script, which means it will run automatically during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector.",
