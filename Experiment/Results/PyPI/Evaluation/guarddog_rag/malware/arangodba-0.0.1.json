The destination URL is obfuscated using base64 encoding and decodes to 'http://119.8.26.163:58888/p/b66886/os11/', which is a suspicious, hardcoded, non-corporate IP address. This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns associated exclusively with malware: (1) exfiltration of host-specific information without user consent, (2) obfuscation of the C2 endpoint via base64, (3) execution of shell commands to gather environment data, and (4) execution of this logic at the top level of a setup.py file, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or documentation justifying this data collection and exfiltration. The code is designed to run automatically during package installation, making it highly likely to be malicious.",
