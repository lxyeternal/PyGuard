      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process of a Python package (via setup.py). Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise without user consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, and the obfuscation via base64 encoding further confirm malicious intent.",
