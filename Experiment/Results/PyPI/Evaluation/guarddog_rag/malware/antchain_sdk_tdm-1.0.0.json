Specifically, it collects sensitive host information (hostname, current working directory, username) and immediately exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to an external, attacker-controlled domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io) without user consent or notification. This pattern is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where the installation process is hijacked to perform malicious actions. The use of a hardcoded, suspicious domain, the absence of any legitimate installation logic, and the silent exfiltration of system information are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior is consistently associated with malware and is never observed in benign software.",
