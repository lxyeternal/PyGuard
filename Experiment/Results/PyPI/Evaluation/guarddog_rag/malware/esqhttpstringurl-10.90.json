      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command during package installation or setup. Specifically, the subprocess.Popen call on line 9 runs PowerShell with the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of arbitrary or attacker-controlled code. The base64 payload decodes to a command that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it, all without user consent or notification. This is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a setup script, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware.",
