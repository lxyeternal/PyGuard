The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file (Esquele.exe) from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it to a hidden location (~/WindowsCache.exe), then runs it. This behavior is highly indicative of a supply chain attack: it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution (WindowStyle Hidden), and remote payload delivery are all classic hallmarks of malware. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection, further supporting its malicious intent.",
