It automatically installs a large number of potentially sensitive or abuse-prone Python packages (including browser_cookie3, pyautogui, cryptography, etc.) via subprocess without user consent, which is a common tactic in malware to ensure all dependencies for credential theft, system manipulation, or exfiltration are present. Critically, it downloads a remote Python script ('WindowsDefender.py') from a suspicious, non-corporate GitHub URL, writes it to the user's home directory, and immediately executes it via subprocess. This is a classic malware pattern for remote code execution and payload delivery, enabling the attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. There is no user notification, validation, or legitimate business logic for these actions. The combination of these behaviors—automated dependency installation, remote code download and execution, and execution during installation—matches patterns seen exclusively in malware and never in benign software.",
