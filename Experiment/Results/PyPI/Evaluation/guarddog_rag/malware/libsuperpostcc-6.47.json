      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malware: it executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen during the installation process (in a setup.py context). The command is obfuscated and is executed only if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common anti-analysis or persistence technique. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory and then running it. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence malware patterns: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell commands; (2) download and execution of remote payloads without user consent; (3) execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector); (4) use of hidden process creation to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a benign Python package, and it is a classic example of a supply chain attack.",
