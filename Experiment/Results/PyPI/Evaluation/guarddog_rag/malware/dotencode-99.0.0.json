      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command (CustomInstall) that, upon package installation, collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eol6mx6at717hhs.m.pipedream.net/dotencode) without user consent or notification. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware, as it leverages the installation process to execute code and transmit potentially sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality that justifies this behavior, and such actions are never observed in benign software. The use of a custom install hook to perform data exfiltration is a critical risk and strongly indicative of malicious intent.",
