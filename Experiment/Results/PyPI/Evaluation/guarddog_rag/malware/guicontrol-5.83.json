      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: during import or installation (i.e., when the setup.py is run), it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg'. If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic malware technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious code on the victim's machine without user consent. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is likely to download and execute a remote payload, as indicated by the presence of a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) in the decoded string. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' further indicates an attempt to evade user detection. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python packages, where malicious code is executed during installation, potentially compromising the system.",
