This is triggered immediately upon import or execution of the setup script, which is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware: it downloads and executes remote code without user consent, uses obfuscation (base64 encoding), and is embedded in a setup script to trigger during package installation. The use of subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW and -WindowStyle Hidden further attempts to evade user detection. All these characteristics match critical risk indicators for Python malware, especially in supply chain attacks.",
