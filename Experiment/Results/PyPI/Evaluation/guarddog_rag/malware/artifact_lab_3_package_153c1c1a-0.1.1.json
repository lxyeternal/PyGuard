It defines custom setuptools install and develop commands (AfterInstall and AfterDevelop) that, when triggered during package installation or development, execute the function notmalfunc(). This function collects all environment variables from the victim's system (using os.environ), encodes them, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://webhook.site/8f782c5b-990f-4d3d-94cc-fd128b873693). This is a classic data exfiltration technique, commonly seen in supply chain attacks targeting Python package installations. The use of a webhook.site URL, lack of user notification or consent, and execution during installation (a trusted workflow) are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
