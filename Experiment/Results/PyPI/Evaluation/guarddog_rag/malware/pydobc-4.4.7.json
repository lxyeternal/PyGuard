      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem. Specifically: (1) It collects the victim's COMPUTERNAME environment variable and exfiltrates it to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is a hallmark of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration. (2) It downloads a Windows executable (python-install.scr) from another suspicious domain (https://python-release.com), writes it to disk as 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe', and immediately executes it via os.system('start '+filename). This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. (3) All of this is triggered automatically during package installation by hooking into setuptools' install command (cmdclass={'install': PostInstallCommand}), which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. (4) The code suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its activity. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or documentation justifying these actions. The combination of data exfiltration, remote payload download and execution, and execution during installation is exclusively observed in malware samples and never in benign software.",
