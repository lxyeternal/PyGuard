It defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that, during package installation on Windows systems, dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet. The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine at install time. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, as it allows the attacker to run hidden, obfuscated code on any system where the package is installed, without user consent or notification. The use of hardcoded cryptographic keys, encrypted payloads, dynamic imports, and execution during installation are all strong indicators of malware, and there is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
