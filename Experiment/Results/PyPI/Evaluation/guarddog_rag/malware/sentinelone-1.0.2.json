It collects sensitive user and system information, including the contents of /etc/hosts, shell history files (.bash_history, .zsh_history), git configuration, SSH keys, and other potentially sensitive files from the user's home directory. It then compresses this data into a zip file and exfiltrates it to a hardcoded external IP address (https://54.254.189.27/api/v1/file/upload) using a curl command. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this data collection and exfiltration. The use of hardcoded, non-corporate IP addresses, the targeting of sensitive files, and the lack of user-facing features or documentation are all strong indicators of malware. This pattern is exclusively observed in malicious samples and is a hallmark of information-stealing malware.",
