      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded payload (base64-encoded PowerShell command) if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. This is a classic malware technique: it uses obfuscation (base64 encoding), spawns a hidden shell process, and executes arbitrary code without user consent or notification. The encoded PowerShell command appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and malicious PyPI packages, as it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation or setup, potentially compromising the system.",
