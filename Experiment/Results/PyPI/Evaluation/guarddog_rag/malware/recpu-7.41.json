The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The command downloads and executes a file from an external, non-transparent URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware: it downloads and runs an external executable without user consent, uses obfuscation to evade detection, and runs during package installation (setup.py), which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a Python package setup script to perform these actions.",
