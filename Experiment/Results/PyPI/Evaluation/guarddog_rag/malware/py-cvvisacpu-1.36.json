The command is base64-encoded and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, a classic obfuscation and payload delivery technique. The decoded command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and writes it to a hidden location (~\\WindowsCache.exe), then attempts to execute it. This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, enabling remote code execution on user systems without consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, and the obfuscated payload all strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is exclusively associated with malware.",
