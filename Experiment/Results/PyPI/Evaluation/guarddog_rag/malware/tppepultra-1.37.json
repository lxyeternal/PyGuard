The encoded command (base64) is a well-known obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent and evade detection. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and running it. This behavior is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: it executes arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification, and is designed to be stealthy (hidden window, error suppression). The use of a try/except block to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and analysis. All these characteristics are exclusively observed in malware and never in benign software.",
