      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly obfuscated payload that is executed immediately upon import. Specifically, the first line uses __import__('builtins').exec(__import__('builtins').compile(__import__('base64').b64decode(...), '<string>', 'exec')) to decode and execute a base64-encoded string. Decoding this payload reveals that it imports modules for file and system operations, writes a script that downloads and executes code from a hardcoded external IP address (http://54.167.173.26/inject/i09xHUvmQ245P8bK), and attempts to clean up traces by deleting temporary files. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious code is hidden in the setup script, runs automatically during installation, downloads and executes further code from an attacker-controlled server, and attempts to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a package setup script, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware.",
