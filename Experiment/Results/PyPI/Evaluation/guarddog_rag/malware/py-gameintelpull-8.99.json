      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a file named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded PowerShell command (base64-encoded) is a classic malware technique for stealthy execution, often used to download and execute further payloads from a remote server. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and EncodedCommand is a hallmark of malware, as it hides execution from the user and obfuscates the payload. The code is wrapped in a try/except block that silently suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. This behavior is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The domain in the encoded command (dl.dropbox.com) is used to fetch a remote executable, which is then run on the victim's machine. All these characteristics are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
