      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command during the package setup process. Specifically, if the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command in hidden mode using the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The base64-encoded command is not transparently documented or explained, and its purpose is hidden from the user. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially in supply chain attacks, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases the stealthiness and malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute such a command, and this behavior is never observed in benign software.",
