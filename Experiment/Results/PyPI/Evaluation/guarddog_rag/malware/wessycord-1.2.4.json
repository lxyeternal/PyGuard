      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (AfterInstall) that, upon package installation, downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://cdn-141.anonfiles.com/scUeHf23z5/cfc2b34c-1689619361/payload.exe) and then executes it using os.system. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python packages, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during installation without user consent. The downloaded file is an .exe, which is highly suspicious in a Python package context and is likely to be a malware payload. There is no legitimate reason for a Discord alternative package to download and execute a remote binary during installation. The code lacks user notification, validation, or integrity checks, and the use of a non-official, anonymous file hosting service further elevates the risk. This behavior is consistently associated with malware and is never observed in benign software.",
