It defines a custom setuptools install command (InstallWithEnvSender) that, during package installation, collects all environment variables from the victim's system and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (https://a5gpivpedls2wjfxl0bm6dmwenke84wt.oastify.com). This is a classic data exfiltration technique, often used in supply chain attacks via malicious Python packages. The exfiltrated environment variables may contain sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, tokens, and other secrets. The code is executed automatically during installation, without user consent or notification, and serves no legitimate purpose. The use of a suspicious domain and the lack of any legitimate package functionality further confirm the malicious intent.",
