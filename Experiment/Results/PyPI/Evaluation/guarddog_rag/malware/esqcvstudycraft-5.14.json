      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is provided as a long, base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a classic malware technique for obfuscating and delivering payloads. Decoding the base64 reveals that the command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence malware indicators: remote code download and execution, obfuscation via encoding, hidden execution, and lack of user interaction or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack via a malicious setup.py script in a Python package.",
