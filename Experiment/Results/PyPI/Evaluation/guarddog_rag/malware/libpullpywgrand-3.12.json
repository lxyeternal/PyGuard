On import or installation, it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell process with a long, base64-encoded command. The encoded command is passed to PowerShell with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The decoded command appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious, non-standard domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, especially in supply chain attacks via Python packages. The use of broad try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and analysis. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute remote binaries in this manner.",
