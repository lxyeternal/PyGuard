      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious payloads on Windows systems. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution from the user. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, especially in the context of a setup script, as it enables remote code execution, payload delivery, or further compromise during package installation (a classic supply chain attack vector). The code is also wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection, another hallmark of malicious code.",
