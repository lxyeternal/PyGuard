It defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python: the payload is hidden and obfuscated, only revealed and executed at install time, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscated class names, suspicious package metadata (typosquatted 'Matplkotlib'), and the absence of any legitimate business logic further support the malicious classification. The decrypted payload could perform any action, including data exfiltration, credential theft, or system compromise. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware.",
