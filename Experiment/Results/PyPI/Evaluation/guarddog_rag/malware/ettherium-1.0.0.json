It overrides the setuptools install command to execute hidden code during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The custom install class (vRTgwLDIcTiAjNQBnXTeEofgoNBitKUfYtsLvmhLlEQsfZKJhhebyvfEfebClGmiJQrOpieeJRDfPHDgZuX) imports 'requests' and 'fernet' only if the OS is Windows, then uses Fernet to decrypt an encrypted payload and immediately executes it with exec(). The payload is not visible in the source, making its intent opaque and preventing static analysis. This pattern—encrypted, obfuscated payloads executed at install time, with no user interaction or notification, and the use of dynamic imports and exec—is exclusively observed in malware. The package name 'ettherium' is also suspiciously similar to 'ethereum', suggesting typosquatting. There is no legitimate installation logic; the install hook is abused for arbitrary code execution. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack.",
