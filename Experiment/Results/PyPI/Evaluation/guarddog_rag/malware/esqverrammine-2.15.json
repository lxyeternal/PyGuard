      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory ('tahg'), and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and executed with '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a classic malware technique for stealthy execution. Decoding the base64 reveals that the PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation (setup.py), enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never found in benign software.",
