      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (CustomInstall) that, when the package is installed (e.g., via pip install), executes a reverse shell payload. The payload is constructed as a Python one-liner that connects to a hardcoded external host and port (LHOST = 'e6j4342057.zicp.fun', LPORT = 26264), redirects standard input/output/error to the socket, and spawns a bash shell, effectively granting remote shell access to the attacker. The payload is base64-encoded and then executed via os.system('echo %s|base64 -d|bash' % encoded), which is a classic obfuscation and execution technique used in malware. This behavior is triggered automatically during installation, making it a supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate reason for a package install script to open a reverse shell or execute obfuscated shell commands, and the use of a suspicious external domain further confirms malicious intent.",
