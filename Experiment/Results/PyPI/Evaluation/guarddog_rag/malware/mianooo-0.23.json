During installation, it collects the victim's hostname and local IP address using socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname(), then sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL via the discord.Webhook API. This exfiltration of system information occurs without user consent or notification, and is triggered solely by installing the package, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious PyPI packages. The use of a hardcoded external webhook, the collection of host-specific information, and the lack of any legitimate application logic or user interaction are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is consistently associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
