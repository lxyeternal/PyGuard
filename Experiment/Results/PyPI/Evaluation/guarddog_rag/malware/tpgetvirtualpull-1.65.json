The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware: it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding, hidden PowerShell invocation, and remote payload download and execution are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code is also wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection, further supporting its malicious nature.",
