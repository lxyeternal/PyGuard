      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It abuses the Python package installation process by defining a custom install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary, encrypted code during installation. Specifically, on Windows systems, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious payload is hidden (encrypted), only revealed and executed at install time, and the use of exec() allows for arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this behavior. The use of obfuscated author/package metadata and the absence of any real package functionality further support the malicious classification. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
