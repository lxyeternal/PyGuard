      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command with a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py script). Specifically, if the 'tahg' file or directory does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, as it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
