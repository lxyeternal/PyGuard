      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is provided as a long, base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is run with -WindowStyle Hidden and subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, ensuring no visible window appears, further increasing stealth. The encoded payload, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and attempts to run it, which is a classic malware delivery and execution technique. This behavior is highly indicative of a supply chain attack, as it is embedded in a setup.py file and will execute during package installation, potentially compromising any system that installs the package. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion.",
