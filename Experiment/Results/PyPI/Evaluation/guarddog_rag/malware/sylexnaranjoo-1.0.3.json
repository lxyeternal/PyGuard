      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a fully functional remote access trojan (RAT) designed to steal sensitive information and provide remote control over a victim's Windows machine via Discord. Key malicious behaviors include: (1) Stealing browser cookies and Chrome history, exfiltrating them via Discord; (2) Extracting and exfiltrating Discord and browser tokens, which can be used to hijack accounts; (3) Taking screenshots and webcam images without user consent and sending them to the attacker's Discord server; (4) Executing arbitrary shell commands and downloading/executing files on the victim's machine without user interaction; (5) Forcing a system shutdown or blue screen (DoS); (6) Changing the victim's wallpaper and displaying fake error messages; (7) Hardcoded Discord bot tokens, allowing persistent attacker access; (8) Collecting system information (username, IP, OS, CPU) and reporting it to the attacker's Discord server; (9) No user notification, logging, or consent for any of these actions. The code uses multiple techniques associated with malware, such as direct access to sensitive directories, shell=True in subprocess, and exfiltration of credentials and system data. The flagged line (requests.get to Discord API) is used to validate and enumerate stolen tokens, a classic credential-stealing technique. The overall structure, intent, and lack of legitimate user-facing functionality make this code highly malicious.",
