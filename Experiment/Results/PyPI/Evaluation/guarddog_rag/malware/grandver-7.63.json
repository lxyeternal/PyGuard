      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as the actual PowerShell command is hidden from static analysis. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides failures or detection. Critically, this code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute automatically during package installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks). The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and runs them. This enables remote code execution, persistence, and potentially further compromise of the system. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
