It defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the target system during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution, especially in a setup.py context, is strongly associated with malware. The package name 'playwritgh' is also a likely typosquat of the legitimate 'playwright' package, further indicating malicious intent.",
