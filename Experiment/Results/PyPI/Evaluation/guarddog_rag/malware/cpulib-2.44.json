Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then invokes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is triggered during package installation, is obfuscated, downloads and executes a remote binary, and attempts to evade detection by hiding the PowerShell window. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
