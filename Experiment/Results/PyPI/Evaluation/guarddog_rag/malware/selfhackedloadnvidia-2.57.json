The command is base64-encoded and obfuscated, and it downloads and executes a remote payload from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com). This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and Python malware: it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent, using obfuscation to evade detection. The use of a hidden window, encoded PowerShell, and execution during package installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for this code to exist in a setup script for a Python package, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
