The encoded PowerShell command is passed to 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...', which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The use of subprocess.Popen with a hidden window, encoded command, and no user interaction or notification is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery. The code is obfuscated, suppresses errors, and is triggered during installation (setup.py), which is a common vector for malicious Python packages. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' further increases suspicion. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and is not found in benign software.",
