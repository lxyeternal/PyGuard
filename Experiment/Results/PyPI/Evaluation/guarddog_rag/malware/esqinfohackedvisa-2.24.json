      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and executed with PowerShell's -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com), specifically a file named 'Esquele.exe', and saves it to the user's home directory. It then attempts to execute this file. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence indicators of malware: remote payload download and execution, use of obfuscated PowerShell, lack of user interaction or consent, and execution during package setup (supply chain attack vector). The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. The rest of the file is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate package. This code is highly likely to be part of a supply chain attack or malicious PyPI package.",
