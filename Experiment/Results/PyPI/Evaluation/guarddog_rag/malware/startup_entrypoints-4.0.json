      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits several hallmarks of malicious behavior, particularly those associated with supply chain attacks in Python packages. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command (CustomInstallCommand) that registers a function (_post_install) to be executed at process exit, which is triggered during package installation. (2) The _post_install function collects host-specific information (the fully qualified domain name via socket.getfqdn()), encodes it with base64, and appends it as a query parameter to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://static-server-0300a62eb3f9.herokuapp.com/image.png). (3) It then downloads the response from this URL and writes it to a local file (image.png) in the package directory. (4) There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this network activity or file write. (5) The use of a non-corporate, Heroku-based domain, combined with the exfiltration of host information and automated execution during installation, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. (6) This pattern is not observed in benign software and is a classic indicator of supply chain attacks, where installation scripts are hijacked to collect and exfiltrate system information or deliver secondary payloads.",
