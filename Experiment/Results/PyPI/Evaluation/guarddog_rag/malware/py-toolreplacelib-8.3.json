The PowerShell command is obfuscated and is executed automatically during the package setup process, without user interaction or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. The code checks for the existence of a directory ('tahg') and, if not present, triggers the PowerShell payload, which is a common evasion and persistence technique. The encoded command, when decoded, appears to download and execute a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern. This behavior is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign software.",
