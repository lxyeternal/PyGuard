      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' argument. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in a setup script, runs automatically during installation, and downloads and executes a remote payload without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
