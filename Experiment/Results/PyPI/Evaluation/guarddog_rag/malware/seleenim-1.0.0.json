      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation (i.e., when a user runs 'pip install'), will execute arbitrary, encrypted Python code. Specifically, the custom install class imports 'requests' and 'fernet' only if the OS is Windows, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload, and immediately executes the result with 'exec'. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden and obfuscated, only revealed at install time, and can perform any action on the victim's machine (e.g., data exfiltration, backdoor installation, credential theft, etc.). The use of encrypted payloads, dynamic imports, and execution during installation are all strong indicators of malware, and there is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a setup script. The package metadata (name, author, description) is also nonsensical, which is typical of malicious or typosquatted packages.",
