The PowerShell command is obfuscated and encoded, which is a classic malware technique to evade detection and deliver or execute a secondary payload. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand is a hallmark of malicious code, as it allows for stealthy execution without user awareness. The code is placed in a setup script, meaning it will run automatically during package installation, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The presence of a suspicious comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the lack of any legitimate reason for this behavior further confirm its malicious intent.",
