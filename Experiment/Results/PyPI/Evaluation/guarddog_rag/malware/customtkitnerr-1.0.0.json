      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It overrides the setuptools install command to execute hidden, encrypted code during package installation. Specifically, in the custom install class, it checks if the OS is Windows, then imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' (from the cryptography package), and uses Fernet to decrypt an encrypted payload. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). The encrypted payload is a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted blob, which is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true behavior of the code from static analysis. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks: the code is executed automatically on install, without user interaction or consent, and the payload is hidden from static inspection. The use of obfuscated class names, suspicious package metadata, and the presence of unnecessary dependencies (requests, fernet) further support the assessment that this is a malicious package designed to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.",
