      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command during the package setup phase. Specifically, if the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and then runs it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is executed during installation, potentially compromising the system without user consent or awareness. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
