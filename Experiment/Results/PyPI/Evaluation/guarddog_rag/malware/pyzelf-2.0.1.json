      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It abuses the setuptools install hook (InstallCommand) to execute a highly obfuscated, base64-encoded payload during package installation. The payload, when decoded, imports os and subprocess, retrieves the current username, and checks for the existence of a specific path in the user's AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\System86 directory. If the path does not exist, it creates it and then writes and executes a PowerShell script that downloads and runs a remote executable from a Discord CDN URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), and then executes another binary (WIN32.exe) in the same directory. The code also attempts to run a batch file with admin privileges. All of this is done silently, with errors suppressed, and without user consent. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, using obfuscation, dynamic code execution, privilege escalation, and remote payload delivery. The use of base64-encoded exec, silent error suppression, and execution during install are all strong indicators of malware, with no legitimate application logic present.",
