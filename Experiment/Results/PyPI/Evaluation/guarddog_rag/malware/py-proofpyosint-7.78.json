      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command. The encoded command (base64) is passed to PowerShell with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The decoded command downloads and/or executes a file from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and likely executes them. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware: it downloads and executes remote code without user consent, uses obfuscation to evade detection, and attempts to hide its execution. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a strong indicator of a supply chain or installation-time attack.",
