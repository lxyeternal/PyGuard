      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is provided as a long base64-encoded string, which is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the payload from static analysis and security tools. Decoding the base64 reveals that the command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is embedded in a setup script to download and run a remote payload during package installation. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner, and this behavior is exclusively observed in malware samples.",
