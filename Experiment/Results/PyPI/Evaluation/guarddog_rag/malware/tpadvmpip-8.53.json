This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed on the victim's machine without user consent or visibility. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and/or executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), further indicating malicious intent. The use of try/except to suppress all errors, the lack of user notification, and the embedding of this logic in a setup script (which is run during package installation) are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware targeting the software supply chain.",
