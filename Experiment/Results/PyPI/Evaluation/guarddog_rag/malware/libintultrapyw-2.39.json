If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic malware technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious code on the victim's machine without their knowledge. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, the obfuscated payload, and the execution during package installation are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads, potentially compromising the system. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python package malware.",
