It defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that, during package installation on Windows systems, dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet decryption with a hardcoded key to decrypt an encrypted payload. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks: it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, with the actual payload hidden and obfuscated via encryption. The use of dynamic imports, encrypted payloads, and execution during install time is strongly associated with malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages. There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying this behavior. The package metadata (name, author, description) is also suspicious and likely intended to evade detection.",
