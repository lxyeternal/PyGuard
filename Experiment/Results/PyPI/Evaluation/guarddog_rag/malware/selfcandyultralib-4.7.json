      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process of a Python package (via setup.py). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware: it enables remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential system compromise without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute remote binaries in this manner.",
