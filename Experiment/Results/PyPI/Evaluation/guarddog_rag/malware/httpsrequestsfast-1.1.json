      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a classic example of a Discord token stealer, which is a type of information-stealing malware. It searches for LevelDB files in various browser and Discord client directories, extracts potential Discord authentication tokens using regex, validates them by making requests to the Discord API, and then exfiltrates the valid tokens (along with associated user data such as email, phone, and billing information) to an attacker-controlled Discord webhook. The webhook URL is obfuscated using base64 encoding, which is a common tactic to evade static detection. The code runs automatically without user interaction or consent, collects sensitive authentication credentials, and transmits them to an external server. It also suppresses errors to avoid detection. All of these behaviors are strong indicators of malicious intent and are never found in benign software.",

      "false_positive_reason": "The code defines a class with a method that retrieves the public IP address of the host using requests.get('https://api.ipify.org/'). This is a common and benign pattern for determining the external IP address, often used in network utilities, diagnostics, or cloud applications. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, privilege escalation, code execution, obfuscation, or any other suspicious or malicious behavior. The code does not transmit the IP address elsewhere, does not perform any file or process operations, and does not hide its intent. The use of a public API (ipify.org) is typical for such functionality. The security tool likely flagged this due to the presence of a hardcoded external URL, but in this context, the behavior is benign and not indicative of malware.",
