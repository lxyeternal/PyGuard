This pattern is a hallmark of malware delivery and execution, as it enables remote code execution from an untrusted source without user consent or notification. The code is embedded directly in the setup.py file, which means it will execute during package installation, making it a supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner. The absence of error handling, user interaction, or validation further elevates the risk. This pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples and is never seen in benign software.",
