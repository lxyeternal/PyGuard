It defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python: the payload is hidden and obfuscated, only revealed and executed at install time, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The use of encrypted payloads, dynamic code execution, and the absence of any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality are all strong indicators of malware. The code is further obfuscated by using a long, meaningless class name and non-descriptive metadata. The behavior is consistent with known malicious PyPI packages that deliver secondary payloads, steal data, or establish persistence.",
