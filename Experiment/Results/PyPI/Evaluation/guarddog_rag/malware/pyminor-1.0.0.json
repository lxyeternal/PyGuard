This is a classic supply chain attack vector, as it allows arbitrary, hidden code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or visibility. The obfuscation, lack of documentation, and use of dynamic code execution are all hallmarks of Python malware, especially in the context of PyPI or similar package repositories. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute hidden, obfuscated code at install time, and this pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples.",
