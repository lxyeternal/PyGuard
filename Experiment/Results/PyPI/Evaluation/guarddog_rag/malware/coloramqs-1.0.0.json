      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It abuses the setuptools install hook by defining a custom install class (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary, encrypted code during package installation. Specifically, on Windows systems, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and immediately executes a payload using exec(Fernet(...).decrypt(...)). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden via Fernet encryption, and the key and ciphertext are hardcoded. The decrypted code is executed without user consent or visibility, and the payload is completely opaque to static analysis. This technique is exclusively observed in malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages, and enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine at install time. The use of obfuscated metadata (randomized author, description, etc.), the lack of legitimate functionality, and the presence of network and cryptography libraries further confirm the malicious intent.",
