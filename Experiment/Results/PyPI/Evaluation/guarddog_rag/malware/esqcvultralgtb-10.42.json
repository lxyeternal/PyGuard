      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded payload. The payload is base64-encoded and passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious commands on Windows systems. The command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), specifically a file named 'Esquele.exe', and saves it to a hidden location. This behavior is a classic indicator of malware: it downloads and executes a remote payload without user consent, uses obfuscation to evade detection, and runs during package installation (setup.py), which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions.",
