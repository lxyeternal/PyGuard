Specifically, the execute() function downloads a Windows executable (MCCheat.exe) from a hardcoded Discord CDN URL and immediately executes it using os.system, attempting to bypass UAC with 'RunAsInvoker'. There is no user notification, consent, or validation of the downloaded file. This pattern—downloading and executing a remote payload during package installation—is a textbook example of a supply chain attack and is never observed in benign software. The use of a suspicious package name, empty packages list, and the absence of legitimate installation logic further confirm malicious intent.",
