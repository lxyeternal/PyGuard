      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen during package installation (i.e., in the setup.py context). The command is base64-encoded and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the payload. The decoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a textbook supply chain attack vector, as it runs automatically when the package is installed, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
