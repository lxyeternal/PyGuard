      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen during the installation process (likely in setup.py). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and encoded, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) without user consent or notification. The use of subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW ensures the process is hidden from the user. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of malware, especially in the context of Python package installation scripts. The code is designed to run automatically upon installation, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise.",
