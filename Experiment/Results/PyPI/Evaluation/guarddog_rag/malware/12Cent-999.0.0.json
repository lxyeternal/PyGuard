      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It abuses the Python package installation process by defining a custom install command (CustomInstall) that executes automatically when the package is installed. During installation, it collects sensitive system information, including the hostname, current working directory, username, and directory listings of '/', '/root/', '/home/', and '/root/.ssh/' (the latter often containing SSH keys). It then exfiltrates this data via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (https://j0j0.xyz/lists/...), which is not associated with any legitimate service. The code attempts to create a file in '/root/' (a privileged location), and uses multiple try/except blocks to suppress errors and avoid detection. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate reason for this behavior. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, commonly seen in malicious PyPI packages, and is strongly associated with credential theft and data exfiltration malware.",
