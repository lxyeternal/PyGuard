      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior characteristic of supply chain attacks. Specifically, it defines a custom setuptools install command (PostInstallCommand) that, upon package installation, automatically downloads a Windows executable (DigitalPulse.exe) from a suspicious, non-corporate URL (https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe) and immediately executes it using os.system('start '+filename). This is done without user notification, consent, or validation of the downloaded file. The use of a remote, hardcoded URL, the lack of integrity checks, and the execution of a potentially untrusted binary during installation are all strong indicators of malware. This pattern is exclusively observed in malicious Python packages and is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.",
