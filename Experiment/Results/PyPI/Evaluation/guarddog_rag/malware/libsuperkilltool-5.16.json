      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and, when decoded, is likely to download and/or execute a payload from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com) and save it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack vector, as the code is embedded in a setup.py file and will execute automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of PowerShell in hidden mode, encoded commands, and external payload retrieval are all strong indicators of malware, as is the lack of error handling, logging, or legitimate business logic. The code is obfuscated and designed to evade detection, and the behavior matches known patterns of Python-based malware and supply chain attacks.",
