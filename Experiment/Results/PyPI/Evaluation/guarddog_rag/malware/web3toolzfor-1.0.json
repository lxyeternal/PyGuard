It then exfiltrates this data to an external server via a Discord webhook, the URL for which is obfuscated using base64 encoding. The use of obfuscated (base64-encoded) webhook URLs, the lack of any legitimate user-facing functionality, and the automated exfiltration of host-specific data are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is consistent with information-stealing malware and is not observed in benign software. The code also imports modules commonly used in malware (e.g., requests, psutil, wmi, subprocess), and the exfiltration is performed in a single, automated step, further supporting the malicious classification.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to steal sensitive Steam user data from a Windows system and exfiltrate it to an external server controlled by the attacker. Specifically, it locates the Steam installation directory, collects files starting with 'ssfn' (which are used for Steam authentication and can be used to hijack accounts), and the Steam 'config' directory (which contains user configuration and potentially sensitive information). It then compresses these files into a zip archive in the system's TEMP directory. The code base64-decodes a hardcoded webhook URL (obfuscation technique), and sends the zip file via an HTTP POST request to this external endpoint (Discord webhook). After exfiltration, it attempts to delete the zip file to cover its tracks. The code uses several classic malware techniques: obfuscated C2 URL, targeting of sensitive authentication files, automated exfiltration without user consent, and minimal error handling to avoid detection. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation, and the code is not part of any known benign workflow.",
