The decoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and writes it to a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution (WindowStyle Hidden), and remote payload delivery are all strong indicators of malware. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its behavior. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions.",
