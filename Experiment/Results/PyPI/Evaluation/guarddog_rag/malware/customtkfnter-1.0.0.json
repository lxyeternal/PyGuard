The setup.py script defines a custom install command (with an obfuscated class name) that, during installation, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet. The payload is not visible in the source code, making its intent and actions opaque, but this pattern is a hallmark of malware: (1) it executes arbitrary, hidden code at install time without user consent; (2) it uses strong obfuscation (Fernet encryption) to hide the payload; (3) it only triggers on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), a common targeting technique; (4) the package metadata (name, author, description) is nonsensical, which is typical of malicious or typosquatted packages. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a critical risk for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further compromise.",
