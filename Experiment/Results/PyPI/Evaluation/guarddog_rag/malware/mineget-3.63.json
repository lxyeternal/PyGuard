      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command during the installation process (in the setup.py script) if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and is run with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and '-WindowStyle Hidden', which are classic indicators of obfuscated and stealthy execution. Decoding the base64 reveals that the command downloads an executable ('Esquele.exe') from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is designed to run automatically during package installation, downloads and executes a remote payload, and uses obfuscation and exception suppression to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware.",
