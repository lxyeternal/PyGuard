      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is provided as a long, base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is run with -WindowStyle Hidden and subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, ensuring no visible window appears, further increasing stealth. The encoded payload, when decoded, downloads and/or executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnytzbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors and the presence of a suspicious author/email further support the malicious classification.",
