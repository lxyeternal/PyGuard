      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is heavily obfuscated, with non-descriptive variable and function names, and uses dynamic code execution techniques. Specifically, it contains the following critical risk patterns: (1) It stores large zlib-compressed byte strings and decompresses them at runtime, which is a classic malware obfuscation and payload delivery technique. (2) It uses dynamic code execution via eval and compile, as seen in the lambda chain: (lambda XWWXXXXXWWWWXXXWXWWXW:globals()['eval'](globals()['compile'](globals()['str'](...),filename=...,mode='eval'))), which is a hallmark of malware. (3) It dynamically imports modules using __import__, another common obfuscation and evasion technique. (4) The code manipulates the global namespace and executes code that is not visible in the static source, making it impossible to audit what will actually run. (5) The presence of multiple try/except blocks that suppress errors is a common tactic to avoid detection and ensure persistence. (6) The code is labeled as being obfuscated by 'Hyperion', a known obfuscator used in Python malware. (7) The code includes suspicious memory access and manipulation of the global frame, which can be used to tamper with runtime state or inject further payloads. (8) The code executes zlib-decompressed data as code, which is a critical risk pattern observed exclusively in malware. (9) There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying these behaviors. All these factors, especially the dynamic execution of hidden payloads, indicate this code is designed to deliver and execute malicious payloads, likely as part of a supply chain or runtime attack.",
