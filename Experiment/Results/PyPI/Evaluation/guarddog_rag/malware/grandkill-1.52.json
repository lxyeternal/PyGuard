The encoded PowerShell command is passed to 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...', which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, especially in the context of a Python package setup script, as it enables remote code execution, payload delivery, or further compromise of the system without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign software.",
