During installation, it collects sensitive information from the victim's system, including the hostname, current working directory, and username, without user consent or notification. It then exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io), which is commonly used for data exfiltration and attacker-controlled monitoring. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware, as it enables attackers to profile and potentially target victims. There is no legitimate reason for a package installation script to collect and transmit this information externally.",
