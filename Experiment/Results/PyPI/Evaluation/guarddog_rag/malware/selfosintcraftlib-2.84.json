The command is executed only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding and is run with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag to avoid user detection. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute an encoded PowerShell command, especially during package installation, is a critical risk indicator. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its behavior. The presence of a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) in the encoded command suggests it is likely downloading and executing a remote payload, which is a classic malware delivery technique.",
