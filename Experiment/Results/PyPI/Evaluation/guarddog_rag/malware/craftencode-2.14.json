If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a well-known technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is likely to download and execute a remote payload or perform other malicious actions, as indicated by the presence of a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) in the decoded string. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides the malicious activity. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of malware, especially in supply chain attacks targeting Python package installations.",
