      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded (base64) payload. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for delivering and executing malicious payloads on Windows systems. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file (likely a malicious executable) from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code download and execution, obfuscation, lack of user consent, and execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector). The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a setup script, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware.",
