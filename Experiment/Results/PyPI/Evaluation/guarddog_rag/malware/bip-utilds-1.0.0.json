It defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that, during package installation on Windows systems, dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python: it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine at install time, with the actual payload hidden and obfuscated via encryption. The use of exec() on decrypted data, especially in a setup.py install hook, is a critical risk and is never seen in benign software. The package metadata (name, author, etc.) is also suspicious and generic, further supporting the malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is designed to evade static analysis and deliver a hidden payload.",
