      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The encoded command (base64) is passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for executing obfuscated or hidden payloads on Windows systems. The decoded command downloads and/or executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes them. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script, and it is strongly associated with malware.",
