This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware, as it exfiltrates system and user data during the installation process. The use of a non-corporate, non-standard domain, the lack of any legitimate business logic, and the embedding of this behavior in the install hook are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a package install script to exfiltrate such information, and this pattern is not observed in benign software.",
