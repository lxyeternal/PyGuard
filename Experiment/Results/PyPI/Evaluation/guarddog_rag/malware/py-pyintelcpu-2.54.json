The encoded PowerShell command (base64) is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the payload. This behavior is highly suspicious and matches multiple critical risk indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded commands via PowerShell in hidden mode, (2) execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector), (3) lack of user interaction or notification, (4) use of a suspicious, non-descriptive file check as a trigger, (5) broad exception handling to suppress errors and evade detection, and (6) the presence of a suspicious author and email address. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in typosquatted or supply chain attack packages. The PowerShell command likely downloads and executes further payloads or establishes persistence, but even without decoding the payload, the method of execution is sufficient to classify this as malicious.",
