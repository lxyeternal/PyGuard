The encoded PowerShell command is passed to 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...', which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, especially in the context of a Python package setup script, as it enables remote code execution, payload delivery, or further compromise of the system without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation, lack of user interaction, and execution of external commands during installation are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack or malicious package. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' further increases suspicion.",
