The encoded PowerShell command (base64) is a classic obfuscation technique used to evade detection and deliver or execute a secondary payload. The command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation or setup, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python packages and supply chain attacks.",
