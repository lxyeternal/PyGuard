During installation, it automatically downloads a remote Python script ('ratfinal.py') from a hardcoded external URL (hosted on Discord's CDN) and immediately executes it using the local Python interpreter. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The downloaded script could contain any payload, including backdoors, data stealers, or further malware. There is no user interaction, notification, or validation, and the behavior is not justified by any legitimate package functionality. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and is never observed in benign software.",
