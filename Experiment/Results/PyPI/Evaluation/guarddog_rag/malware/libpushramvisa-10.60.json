The command is base64-encoded and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the payload. The decoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and attempts to run it, likely as a secondary payload. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute remote executables in this manner.",
