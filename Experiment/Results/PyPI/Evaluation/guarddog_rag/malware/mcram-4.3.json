The encoded command, when decoded, downloads an executable (Esquele.exe) from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then invokes it. This is a classic dropper/downloader pattern: it fetches and runs a remote binary without user consent, in a hidden window, and only if a marker file ('tahg') does not exist. The use of obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell, hidden execution, and remote payload delivery are all strong indicators of malicious behavior, especially in a setup.py context where code is executed automatically during package installation. This matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code execution, payload obfuscation, abuse of the Python package installation process, and lack of user notification or consent.",
