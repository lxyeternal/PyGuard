This is triggered if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for hiding malicious payloads. The command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence indicators of malware: remote code download and execution, obfuscation via base64 encoding, execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector), lack of user notification or consent, and use of try/except to suppress errors and evade detection. The package metadata (author, email, etc.) is also suspicious and not associated with any reputable project.",
