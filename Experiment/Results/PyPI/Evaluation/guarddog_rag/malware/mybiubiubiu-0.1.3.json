This pattern is a textbook example of information-stealing malware and is strongly associated with supply chain attacks in Python packages. The code is executed as soon as the script runs (not gated behind any user interaction or legitimate install logic), and the exfiltration endpoint is not a trusted or documented service. The use of broad exception handling to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a package to silently collect and transmit this information, especially during installation or import.",
