Specifically, in the custom install class, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' (from the cryptography package), then uses Fernet to decrypt an encrypted payload and immediately executes the result with exec(). The encrypted payload is a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted blob, which is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true behavior of the code from static analysis. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks: the code is only executed during installation, without user interaction or consent, and can perform arbitrary actions on the victim's system. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution (via exec) are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup.py to execute encrypted, hidden code during install, especially without any user notification or documentation.",
