      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command (base64) is passed to PowerShell with the -EncodedCommand flag and -WindowStyle Hidden, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The decoded command downloads and/or executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks via Python package installation scripts. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
