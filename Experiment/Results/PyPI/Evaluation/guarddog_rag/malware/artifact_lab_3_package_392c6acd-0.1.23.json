It connects to a hardcoded external host (6.tcp.eu.ngrok.io) and port, redirects the standard input/output/error streams to the socket, and spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i). This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine, fully compromising the system. The use of a hardcoded external endpoint, lack of user interaction or consent, and direct shell process spawning are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a hallmark of remote access trojans (RATs) and backdoors.",
