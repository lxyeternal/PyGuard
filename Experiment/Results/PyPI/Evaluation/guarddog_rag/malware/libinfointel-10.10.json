      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command during the setup process of a Python package. Specifically, if the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command in hidden mode using the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and/or executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code download and execution, obfuscation via base64 encoding, execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector), and lack of user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python-based malware and supply chain attacks.",
