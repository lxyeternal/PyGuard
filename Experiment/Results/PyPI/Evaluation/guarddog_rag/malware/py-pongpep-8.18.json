Specifically, if the 'tahg' directory does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command in hidden mode with an encoded payload. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, commonly used in malicious PyPI packages to download and execute further payloads, exfiltrate data, or establish persistence on the victim's system. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell, hidden window execution, and the absence of user interaction or notification are all strong indicators of malware. The code is also wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection, further supporting its malicious intent.",
