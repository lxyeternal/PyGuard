      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and executed with PowerShell's -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing potentially harmful payloads on Windows systems. The encoded command appears to download and/or execute a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence malware indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded shell commands; (2) use of PowerShell in hidden mode; (3) download and execution of remote payloads; (4) lack of user interaction or consent; (5) execution during package setup (supply chain attack vector); (6) use of try/except to suppress errors and evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a package setup script, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples.",
