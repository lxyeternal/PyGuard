      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py file). This is triggered if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding and is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which is a classic technique to hide malicious activity from the user. The decoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and then running it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded commands; (2) downloading and executing remote payloads; (3) running code during package installation (supply chain attack vector); (4) use of try/except to suppress errors and evade detection; (5) lack of user notification or consent. These patterns are exclusively observed in malware and are never present in benign software.",
