This behavior is executed automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification, and is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. The use of a custom install hook to perform data exfiltration, especially to a non-corporate, non-standard domain, is a critical risk indicator and is not observed in benign software.",
