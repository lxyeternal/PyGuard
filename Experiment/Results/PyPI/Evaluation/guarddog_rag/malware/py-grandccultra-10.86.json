      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen during the installation process (likely in setup.py). The PowerShell command is obfuscated and is executed only if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common anti-analysis or persistence technique. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory and then running it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell commands; (2) download and execution of remote code without user consent; (3) use of hidden process execution to evade detection; (4) embedding this logic in a setup script to trigger on package install (supply chain attack vector); (5) use of a suspicious or attacker-controlled domain. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a benign package, and it is a classic pattern for Python-based malware distributed via PyPI or similar channels.",
