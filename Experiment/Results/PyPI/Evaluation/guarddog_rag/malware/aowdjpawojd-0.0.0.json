      "malicious_behavior": "This code is heavily obfuscated using techniques such as variable renaming, base64 encoding, and dynamic evaluation (eval, exec). It dynamically imports modules, decodes multiple layers of encoded data, and ultimately executes the decoded payload. The use of eval and exec on decoded data is a classic hallmark of malware, as it allows arbitrary code execution. The code also appears to reconstruct and execute a large, hidden payload at runtime, which is a common method for delivering secondary malicious actions (such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or persistence mechanisms). There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation, and the code is structured to evade static analysis and detection. All these characteristics are strongly associated with Python malware, especially supply chain attacks and information stealers.",
