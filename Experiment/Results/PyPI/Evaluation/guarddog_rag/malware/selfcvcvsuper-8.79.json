If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic malware technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious code on the victim's machine without user consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, the obfuscated payload, and the execution during package installation are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is likely to download and execute further payloads or establish persistence, which is a hallmark of Python malware distributed via PyPI or similar channels.",
