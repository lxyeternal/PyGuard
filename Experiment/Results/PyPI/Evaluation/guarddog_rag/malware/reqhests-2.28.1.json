      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior. The 'execute' function downloads a list of executables from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt), then downloads and writes additional executables from the same server to disk, sets their permissions, and executes them automatically based on the operating system. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, enabling remote code execution and system compromise. The code is further disguised by wrapping the 'execute' call inside redefined HTTP verb functions (get, post, put, etc.), so that any use of these functions will trigger the malicious payload download and execution. There is no user interaction, validation, or legitimate business logic, and the use of a direct IP address, lack of error handling, and immediate execution of downloaded binaries are all strong indicators of malware. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a critical risk for supply chain attacks or remote code execution.",
