      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is provided as a long, base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The decoded command downloads and executes a remote executable (Esquele.exe) from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, specifically a supply chain attack or trojan delivered via a Python package. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python-based malware targeting package installation or setup scripts.",
