This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python, as it allows arbitrary, hidden code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. The obfuscation, lack of user notification, suppression of all exceptions, and execution of dynamically generated code are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality that justifies this behavior. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is consistently associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
