This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed on the victim's machine without their knowledge. The command is triggered during package installation (in the setup.py context), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) in the encoded command suggests it is downloading and possibly executing a remote payload. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its behavior. These patterns are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
