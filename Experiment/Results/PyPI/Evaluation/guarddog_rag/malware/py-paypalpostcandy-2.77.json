This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never seen in benign software. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and is executed only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of subprocess.Popen with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution without user consent or visibility. The base64-encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), which is a classic malware delivery technique. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and evade detection. All these behaviors are consistent with known malware patterns, especially those targeting the Python package supply chain.",
