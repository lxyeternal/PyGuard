The command is obfuscated and uses '-EncodedCommand', a common technique in malware to hide the true intent of the payload. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered automatically upon installation, without user consent or notification, and attempts to download and execute a potentially malicious binary. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the obfuscated command, and the lack of any legitimate business logic further confirm the malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware targeting the supply chain.",
