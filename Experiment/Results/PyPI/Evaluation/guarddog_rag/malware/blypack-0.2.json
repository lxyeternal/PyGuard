This function is called immediately after the setup() function, meaning it will execute automatically when the package is installed. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python, where arbitrary code is executed on the user's system during package installation without their knowledge or consent. The use of a hardcoded, suspicious URL, lack of user interaction, and execution during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
