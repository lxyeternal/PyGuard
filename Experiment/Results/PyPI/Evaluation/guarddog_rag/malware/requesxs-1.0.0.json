      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It subclasses setuptools' install command (GruppeInstall) to execute arbitrary code during package installation, specifically on Windows systems. The code imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then uses Fernet decryption with a hardcoded key to decrypt an opaque, encrypted payload, which is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern—decryption followed by execution in an install hook—is a hallmark of Python supply chain malware. The payload is hidden from static analysis, and the use of install hooks ensures the code runs automatically upon installation, without user consent or notification. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a benign package, and the obfuscation, lack of documentation, and suspicious package metadata further reinforce the malicious nature.",
