      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior. Upon import or installation (since the init() function is called at the top level), it collects sensitive system information: the contents of the /flag file (which is often used in CTFs or as a placeholder for sensitive data), the current username, hostname, and local IP address. It then encodes this data in base64 and sends it via an HTTP request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://124.70.159.15:60006). This is a classic data exfiltration pattern, with no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose. The use of os.popen('cat /flag') to read a potentially sensitive file, combined with immediate outbound network communication, is a strong indicator of credential or flag theft. The code is embedded in what appears to be a setup.py file, meaning it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of broad try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
