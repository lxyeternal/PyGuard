If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic malware technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or remote code on the victim's machine without user consent. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes further code from a suspicious external URL (github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe), which is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack and remote code execution. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides the malicious activity. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages.",
