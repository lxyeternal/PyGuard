It then encodes this data and sends it to a hardcoded external API endpoint (https://rk8xxqzdug.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Test/response) without user consent or notification. This pattern is a hallmark of information-stealing malware and supply chain attacks, especially when embedded in a setup script that will execute during package installation. The use of os.popen to execute shell commands, the reading of /etc/passwd, and the exfiltration of this data to an external server are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality that justifies this behavior.",
