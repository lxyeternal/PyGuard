Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery: it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent, triggered simply by installing the package. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
