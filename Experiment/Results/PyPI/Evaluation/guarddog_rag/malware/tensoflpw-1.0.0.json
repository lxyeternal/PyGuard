The setup.py script defines a custom install command (with an obfuscated, randomly generated class name) that, during installation, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet. The payload is not visible in the source code, making its intent and actions opaque, but this pattern is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages. The use of exec on decrypted data, the obfuscated class name, and the lack of any legitimate package functionality are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This code will execute arbitrary, attacker-controlled code on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification.",
