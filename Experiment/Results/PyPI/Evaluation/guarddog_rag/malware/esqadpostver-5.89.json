The PowerShell command is obfuscated (base64-encoded) and is run with '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a classic technique to evade user detection. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote, hardcoded, non-trusted domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where arbitrary code is executed on the user's system during package installation, without user consent or legitimate purpose. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and analysis. All these behaviors are exclusively associated with malware and are never found in benign software.",
