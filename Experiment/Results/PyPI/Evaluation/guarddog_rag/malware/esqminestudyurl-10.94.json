      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process of a Python package (via setup.py). Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code on the user's system without consent, using obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution (no window), and a try/except block to suppress errors and evade detection. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code execution, obfuscated payload delivery, execution during installation, and use of suspicious external infrastructure.",
