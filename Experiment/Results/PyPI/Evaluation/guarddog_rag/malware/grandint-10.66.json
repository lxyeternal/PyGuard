The encoded PowerShell command is passed to 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...', which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, especially in the context of a Python package setup script, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation, lack of user interaction, and execution of external commands during installation are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack or malware delivery. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of malicious activity.",
