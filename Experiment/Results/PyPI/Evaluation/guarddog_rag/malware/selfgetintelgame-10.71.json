The PowerShell command is obfuscated and is likely used to download and/or execute a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) without user consent or notification. This behavior is triggered automatically during package installation (supply chain attack vector), uses obfuscation (base64 encoding), suppresses all exceptions to evade detection, and is embedded in a setup script, which is a hallmark of Python malware. The use of subprocess.Popen with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' is a classic technique for covertly executing malicious commands. The code matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code execution, obfuscation, execution during installation, and communication with a suspicious external server.",
