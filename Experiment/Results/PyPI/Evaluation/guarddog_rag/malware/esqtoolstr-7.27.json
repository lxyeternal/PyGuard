      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The command is base64-encoded and executed with PowerShell's -EncodedCommand flag and -WindowStyle Hidden, which is a classic malware technique for stealthy execution of secondary payloads, remote code, or further infection steps. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack or malicious package: the code is triggered during package installation (setup.py), runs without user consent, is obfuscated, and downloads and executes a remote binary. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never found in benign packages.",
