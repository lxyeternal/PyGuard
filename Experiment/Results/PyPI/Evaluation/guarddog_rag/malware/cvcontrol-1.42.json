The encoded PowerShell command is passed to 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...', which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. This behavior is highly indicative of a supply chain attack, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and the context (setup script) are all strong indicators of malware, and this pattern is not found in benign software. The rest of the setup script appears to be a decoy to masquerade as a legitimate package.",
