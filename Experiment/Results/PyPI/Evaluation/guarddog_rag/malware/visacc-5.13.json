      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and executed in hidden mode, which is a classic malware technique for stealthy payload delivery, remote code execution, or further compromise. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (the URL is obfuscated in the encoded string), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote payload delivery. This behavior is never observed in benign software, especially in setup scripts, and is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. This code would execute automatically during package installation, making it a high-risk supply chain attack vector.",
