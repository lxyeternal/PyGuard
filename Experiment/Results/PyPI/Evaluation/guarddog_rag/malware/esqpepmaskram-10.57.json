      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py script). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and/or executes content from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: execution of obfuscated code during installation (supply chain attack vector), use of hidden process windows, downloading and executing remote payloads, and lack of user notification or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages.",
