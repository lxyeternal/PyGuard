It abuses the Python package installation process by overriding the install command (via the SneakyInstall class) to automatically download an external Windows executable (syswin32.exe) from a suspicious, non-standard domain (https://tryg.ga/syswin32.exe) and immediately executes it using a shell command. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where arbitrary code is executed on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The downloaded executable could be any payload, including malware, ransomware, or a backdoor. The use of shell=True further increases the risk of arbitrary code execution. There is no legitimate reason for a package install script to download and execute an external binary in this manner.",
