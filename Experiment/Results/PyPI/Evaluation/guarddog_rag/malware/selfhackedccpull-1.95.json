      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with a long, base64-encoded command. This command is decoded and executed by PowerShell in hidden mode, which is a classic technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. The encoded command appears to download and execute a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, specifically a supply chain attack or dropper, as it executes arbitrary code during package installation or setup, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. All these characteristics match critical risk indicators for Python malware, especially in the context of malicious PyPI packages.",
