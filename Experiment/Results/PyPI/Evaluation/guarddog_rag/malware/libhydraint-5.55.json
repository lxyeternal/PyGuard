The encoded PowerShell command is not transparently visible in the code, which is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. The use of subprocess.Popen to spawn PowerShell in hidden mode with an encoded command is a well-known method for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. This behavior is highly indicative of malicious activity, especially in the context of a Python package setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The code also suppresses all errors with a bare except, further hiding its actions. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a benign package setup script.",
