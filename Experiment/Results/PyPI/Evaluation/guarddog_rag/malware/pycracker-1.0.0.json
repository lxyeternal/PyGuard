      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: (1) It uses heavy obfuscation, including non-descriptive variable names, base64 encoding, zlib compression, and dynamic code execution via eval and exec. (2) The lambda function on line 5 reconstructs and immediately executes code from an obfuscated payload, a classic malware technique. (3) The code dynamically decodes and executes a secondary payload, which is itself hidden via multiple layers of encoding and compression. (4) There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation; the code's sole purpose is to reconstruct and execute hidden code at runtime. (5) The use of randomization in the decoding process is a known anti-analysis technique. (6) The code sets __builtins__ attributes to obfuscated values, which is a common method to tamper with the Python runtime and evade detection. (7) The presence of a suspicious, obfuscated string that is ultimately executed via eval/exec is a hallmark of malware, especially in supply chain attacks. All of these patterns are strongly associated with Python malware and are never found in benign code.",
