      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior, particularly those associated with supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem. After the standard setuptools.setup() call, the code downloads data from a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://frvezdffvv.pythonanywhere.com/getpackage) using urllib. The downloaded data is written as a base64-encoded payload to a Python file in the user's AppData\\Roaming directory, a location often targeted for persistence or stealth. The code then immediately executes this file using subprocess.Popen, resulting in arbitrary code execution on the user's system. The payload is executed via exec(base64.b64decode(...)), which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique. There is no user interaction, validation, or error handling, and the code is designed to run during package installation, making it a high-severity supply chain risk. All of these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
