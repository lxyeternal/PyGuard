      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py script). Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then invokes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is triggered during package installation, without user consent or notification, and downloads and executes a remote binary, which could be any form of malware (e.g., backdoor, stealer, ransomware). The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote payload delivery are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its behavior.",
