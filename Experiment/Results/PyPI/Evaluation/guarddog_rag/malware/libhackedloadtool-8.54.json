      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern: during installation (in the setup.py script), it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg'. If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a well-known technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The base64-encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware: it achieves remote code execution, payload delivery, and evasion of detection by hiding the PowerShell window and encoding the command. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of malicious PyPI supply chain attacks.",
