      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (i.e., in setup.py). Specifically, it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: executing arbitrary code during package installation, using obfuscation (base64 encoding), and downloading/executing a remote payload from a non-corporate, suspicious domain. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This behavior is strongly associated with malware and is never seen in benign Python packages.",
