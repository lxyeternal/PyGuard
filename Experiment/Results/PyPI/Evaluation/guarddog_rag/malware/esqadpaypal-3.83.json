      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process of a Python package (in the setup.py script). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote payload delivery is strongly associated with malware and is never observed in benign software.",
