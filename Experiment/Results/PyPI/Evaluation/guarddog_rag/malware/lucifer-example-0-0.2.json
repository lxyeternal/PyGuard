      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python script to a temporary file that, when executed, downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://rentry.co/ki74h/raw) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. It then launches this script in a new process using the system's Pythonw interpreter, suppressing all exceptions. This pattern is a classic example of remote code execution (RCE) and is strongly associated with malware. The code provides no user notification, validation, or integrity checks on the downloaded code, and the remote URL is not a trusted or official source. The use of exec on remote content enables arbitrary code execution, which can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware installation. The obfuscated variable names and lack of legitimate business logic further reinforce the malicious nature of this code.",
