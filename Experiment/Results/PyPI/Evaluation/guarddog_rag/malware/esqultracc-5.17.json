The PowerShell command is obfuscated and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a common technique in malware to hide the true intent of the command. The command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern, as it runs during package installation (setup.py), leverages obfuscation, downloads and executes a remote payload, and attempts to evade detection by hiding the process window and suppressing all exceptions. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples.",
