      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (i.e., in the setup script). The command is executed only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding and is run with '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a common technique to hide malicious activity from the user. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious code is triggered during package installation, downloads a remote executable, and runs it without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
