      "malicious_behavior": "This setup.py script overrides the standard installation process by defining a CustomInstall class that executes a function pre_install() from a separate pre_install.py module during package installation. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python packages, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the user's system at install time, without user consent or notification. The contents of pre_install.py are not shown, so its behavior is unknown and could be malicious (e.g., data exfiltration, payload download, system modification). The use of this pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of typosquatted or suspicious packages. The package metadata (e.g., version '99.4.0', odd download_url, and generic description) further increases suspicion. This pattern is never observed in benign software unless the pre-install logic is fully transparent and justified, which is not the case here.",
