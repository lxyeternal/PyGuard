      "malicious_behavior": "This code is clearly malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (CustomInstall) that, when the package is installed, creates a reverse shell to a hardcoded external IP address (39.101.72.63) on port 4242. It redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to the socket, then spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i), effectively giving remote control of the victim's machine to the attacker. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, as the malicious code is executed automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The package metadata (name, description, author, URL) is also suspicious and references a non-official domain. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is solely designed for remote code execution and system compromise.",
