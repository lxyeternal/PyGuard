The PowerShell command is obfuscated and encoded, which is a classic technique used by malware to evade detection and deliver or execute secondary payloads. The use of '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' in PowerShell is a well-known method for stealthy execution of potentially malicious code. This behavior occurs automatically during the package setup process, without user interaction or consent, and is not justified by any legitimate package installation requirement. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection, further indicating malicious intent. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and malware delivery in Python packages.",
