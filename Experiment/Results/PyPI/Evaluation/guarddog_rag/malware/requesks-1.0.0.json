      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It subclasses setuptools' install command (GruppeInstall) to execute arbitrary code during package installation, specifically on Windows systems. The code imports requests and fernet, then uses Fernet to decrypt an opaque, hardcoded payload and immediately executes it with exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden (encrypted), only decrypted at install time, and executed without user consent or visibility. The decrypted payload is not visible in the source, making static analysis difficult and allowing arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscated package metadata (e.g., fake author, suspicious package name 'requesks'), and the fact that this behavior is triggered during installation (not normal runtime), are strong indicators of malware. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages.",
