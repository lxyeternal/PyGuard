      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem. Specifically: (1) It collects the COMPUTERNAME environment variable (a form of host fingerprinting) and exfiltrates it to an external, non-standard domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is not associated with any legitimate package infrastructure. (2) It downloads a Windows executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr) and writes it to disk as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', then immediately executes it via os.system('start '+filename) without any user interaction, validation, or notification. (3) All of this is triggered automatically during package installation by embedding the behavior in a custom setuptools install hook (cmdclass={'install': PostInstallCommand}), ensuring the payload runs as soon as the package is installed. (4) The code lacks any legitimate installation logic or user-facing functionality, and all actions are hidden from the user. These patterns—data exfiltration, remote payload download and execution, and abuse of install hooks—are exclusively observed in malware and are never present in benign packages. The combination of these behaviors, especially in a setup script, is a hallmark of Python package malware.",
