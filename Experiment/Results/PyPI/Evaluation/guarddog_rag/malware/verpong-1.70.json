Specifically, if the 'tahg' path does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is triggered during package installation, downloads a remote executable, and runs it without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. All these behaviors—obfuscated command execution, remote payload download, execution during install, and error suppression—are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
