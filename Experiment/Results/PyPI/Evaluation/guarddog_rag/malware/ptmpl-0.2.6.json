      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that executes during package installation. Inside the run() method, it imports the requests module and sends an HTTP GET request to https://ipinfo.io/json, printing the result. This leaks the installer's public IP address and potentially other metadata to an external server without user consent. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware, as it enables system fingerprinting and exfiltration of host-specific data during installation. The use of this pattern in the install hook, combined with the absence of user notification or legitimate business logic, is a critical risk indicator. Additionally, there is commented-out code that would decrypt and execute an encrypted payload, which is a classic malware technique, though it is not active in this sample. The combination of these factors (network exfiltration during install, use of install hooks, and presence of obfuscated/decryption code) makes this code malicious.",
