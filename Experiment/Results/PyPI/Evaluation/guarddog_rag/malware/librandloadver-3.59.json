      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and executed in hidden mode, which is a classic malware technique for stealthy payload delivery, remote code execution, or further compromise. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, specifically a supply chain attack or installer-based malware, as it executes arbitrary code on the victim's machine without user consent, uses obfuscation, and contacts an external C2 server. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a setup script.",
