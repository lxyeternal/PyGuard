The base64-encoded payload is not transparent and is executed in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden), which is a hallmark of malware attempting to evade user detection. The command downloads and executes a file from an external, non-transparent URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, and will execute automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All of these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, and there are no legitimate reasons for such actions in a package setup script.",
