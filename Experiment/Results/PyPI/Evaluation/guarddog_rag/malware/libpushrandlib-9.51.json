The encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote executable ('Esquele.exe') from a suspicious domain ('dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0') and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. It then attempts to execute this file. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded commands; (2) downloading and executing a remote payload without user consent; (3) use of hidden PowerShell windows to evade detection; (4) execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector); (5) lack of user interaction, logging, or legitimate justification. The code is designed to compromise the system stealthily and is consistent with known malware delivery techniques.",
