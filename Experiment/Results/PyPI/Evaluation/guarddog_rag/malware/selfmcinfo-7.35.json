This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed without user consent or visibility. The command is triggered during package installation (in the setup.py context), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) in the encoded command suggests the code is downloading or interacting with a remote resource, likely to fetch and execute additional malicious payloads. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its behavior. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute hidden, obfuscated PowerShell commands that contact external servers.",
