It then immediately executes this file using os.system('start ' + filename). This pattern—downloading and executing a remote binary without user interaction, validation, or notification—is a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks, especially when embedded in a setup.py or similar installation script. The code lacks any legitimate business logic, error handling, or user-facing features, and the use of a non-corporate, non-official URL further elevates the risk. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine and is strongly associated with malicious activity in the Python ecosystem.",
