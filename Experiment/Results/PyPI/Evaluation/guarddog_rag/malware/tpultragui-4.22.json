The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory. It then attempts to execute this file. This behavior is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: it leverages the package installation process to deliver and execute arbitrary code from an external, attacker-controlled source. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), silent execution (hidden window), and error suppression (broad try/except) are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner.",
