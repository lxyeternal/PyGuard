Specifically, it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious code is triggered during package installation, is obfuscated via base64 encoding, and downloads and executes remote payloads without user consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its behavior. All these characteristics are strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks in Python packages.",
