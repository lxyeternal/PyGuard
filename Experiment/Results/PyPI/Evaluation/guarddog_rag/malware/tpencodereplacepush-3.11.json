      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the package installation process (in the setup.py context). Specifically, if the 'tahg' file or directory does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and/or executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence indicators of malware: (1) execution of obfuscated code during installation (supply chain attack vector), (2) use of hidden process windows to evade user detection, (3) downloading and executing a remote payload from a non-corporate, suspicious domain, and (4) lack of user notification or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases the stealthiness of the attack. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python supply chain malware.",
