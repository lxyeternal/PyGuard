      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and executing potentially malicious commands on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides its activity. The encoded PowerShell command appears to download and/or execute a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. Embedding this logic in a setup script (setup.py) means it will be triggered during package installation, a well-known supply chain attack vector. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
