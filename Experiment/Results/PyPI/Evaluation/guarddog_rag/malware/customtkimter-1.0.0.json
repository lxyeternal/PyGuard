      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly indicative of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack via a Python package. The setup.py script defines a custom install command class with an obfuscated name. During installation (on Windows), it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts and immediately executes an encrypted payload using Fernet decryption and exec. The payload is not visible in the source code, making its intent and actions opaque, which is a hallmark of malware. This pattern—encrypted payload delivery, dynamic code execution at install time, obfuscated class names, and lack of legitimate package functionality—is strongly associated with Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script. The use of Fernet decryption to hide the payload further increases the risk, as this is a common technique to evade static analysis and deliver secondary malicious actions (such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or further infection).",
