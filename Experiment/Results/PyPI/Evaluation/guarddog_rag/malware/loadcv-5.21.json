      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded PowerShell command downloads an executable ('Esquele.exe') from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0') and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. It then attempts to execute this file. This behavior is triggered during the package installation process (setup.py), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner, and the obfuscation and lack of user notification or consent are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
