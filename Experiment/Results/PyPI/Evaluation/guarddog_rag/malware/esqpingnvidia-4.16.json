The encoded command (base64) is passed to PowerShell with the -EncodedCommand flag and -WindowStyle Hidden, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of arbitrary or malicious payloads. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: it executes arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification, and is highly indicative of malware. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. All these patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and never in benign software.",
