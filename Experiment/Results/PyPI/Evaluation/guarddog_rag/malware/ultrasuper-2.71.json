      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' argument. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The command downloads and executes a file from an external, non-transparent URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnytzbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence malware indicators: remote code download and execution, use of obfuscated/encoded payloads, execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector), and lack of user interaction or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack via a malicious Python package.",
