The subprocess call is not used to execute arbitrary or user-supplied code, nor does it interact with the network, exfiltrate data, or perform any obfuscated or suspicious actions. The parameters are static and derived from the build context, not from untrusted sources. The code is consistent with open-source, benign build logic found in reputable projects (such as cffi). There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or other malicious behaviors. The subprocess usage is limited to querying system configuration, which is a common and necessary operation in build scripts.",
