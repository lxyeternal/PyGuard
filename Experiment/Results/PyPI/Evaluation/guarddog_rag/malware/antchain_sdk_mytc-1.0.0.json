This behavior is executed automatically during the installation process, without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded, non-corporate domain, the lack of legitimate business logic, and the embedding of this logic in a setup script are all hallmarks of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, particularly dependency confusion and supply chain attacks, and is not observed in benign software.",
