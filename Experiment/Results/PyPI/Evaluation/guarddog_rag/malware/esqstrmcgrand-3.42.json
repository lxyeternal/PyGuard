      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed without user consent or visibility. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64-encoded PowerShell command appears to download or interact with a remote resource (the encoded string contains a suspicious URL: 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0'), likely to download and execute a remote executable. This behavior is a hallmark of malware, especially in the context of a setup script, as it enables remote code execution during package installation (a supply chain attack vector). The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
