During the installation process (via a custom install command in setup.py), it performs the following actions without user consent or notification: (1) Creates directories in the Windows Startup folder and another location, establishing persistence; (2) Clones two remote GitHub repositories into these sensitive locations, one of which is named 'defonotagrabber' (a clear indicator of malicious intent); (3) Moves a Python file into the Startup folder to ensure it runs automatically on system boot; (4) Executes a downloaded executable ('main.exe') from the suspiciously named 'defonotagrabber' repository. These actions enable remote code execution, persistence, and potentially further payload delivery or data exfiltration. The code abuses the Python package installation process to compromise the system, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate reason for a package install script to perform these actions, and the lack of user interaction, logging, or error handling further confirms its malicious nature.",
