It defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that, during package installation on Windows systems, dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python: it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, with the actual payload hidden and obfuscated via encryption. The use of hardcoded cryptographic keys, dynamic imports, and execution of decrypted code, especially in a setup.py context, is strongly associated with malware and is never seen in benign packages. The package metadata (name, author, etc.) is also suspicious and non-descriptive, further supporting the malicious classification.",
