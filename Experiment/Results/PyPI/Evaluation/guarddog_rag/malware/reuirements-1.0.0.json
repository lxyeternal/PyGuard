      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly indicative of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack via a Python package. The setup.py script defines a custom install command class with an obfuscated name. During installation (specifically on Windows), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and immediately executes an encrypted payload using Fernet and exec. The payload is not visible in the source code, making its intent and actions opaque, which is a hallmark of malware. This pattern—encrypted payload delivery, dynamic code execution at install time, obfuscated class names, and lack of legitimate package functionality—is strongly associated with Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate business logic for this behavior. The use of exec on decrypted data is a critical risk and is never seen in benign packages.",
