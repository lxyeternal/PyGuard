Specifically, it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command. The decoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest, saving it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, and then executes it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell commands; (2) download and execution of remote code without user consent; (3) execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector); (4) use of hidden process creation to evade detection. These patterns are exclusively observed in malware and are never present in benign software.",
