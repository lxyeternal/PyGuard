      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and exhibits multiple critical risk patterns associated with malware and supply chain attacks. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command that executes arbitrary code during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (2) It creates directories in the Windows Startup folder and other AppData locations, which is a classic persistence mechanism used by malware to ensure code is executed on system startup. (3) It clones remote GitHub repositories (test2lmaos and defonotagrabber) into these sensitive locations, which could deliver and stage additional malicious payloads. (4) It moves a Python file (test.py) into the Startup folder, further ensuring persistence. (5) It executes a downloaded executable (main.exe) from the cloned repository, enabling arbitrary code execution from an untrusted, remote source. (6) All of these actions are performed without user consent, notification, or legitimate business justification, and are triggered automatically during package installation. (7) The use of misleading directory names (e.g., Powerpoint) and suspicious author information further supports the malicious intent. These behaviors are never observed in benign software and are strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
