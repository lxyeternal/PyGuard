      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and exhibits multiple critical risk indicators associated with supply chain attacks and Python malware. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command (XxKmchibFhmLOBhxPKSjVFudcLtKCtLkZVmCGTxzSxlAbCaUszXcqvKSIoHMFCZcQxSJWOdFmMHqEllyEcrJaKCQhxtaJPXrBVbLrtUuWFpPxcEFWdKNEKWSynnQdIvxFuTnRZhX) that executes during package installation. (2) Within this command, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' (the latter for cryptographic operations), and then immediately decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. (3) The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine at install time. (4) The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in supply chain attacks. (5) The package name 'BeutifulSoop' is a typosquat of 'BeautifulSoup', a common tactic in malicious PyPI packages. (6) There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying this behavior. (7) The code is designed to target Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), further indicating targeted malicious intent. All these factors, especially the execution of decrypted code during installation, are exclusive to malware and never observed in benign software.",
