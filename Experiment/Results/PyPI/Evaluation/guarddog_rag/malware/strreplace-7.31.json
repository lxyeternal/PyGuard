The encoded command, when decoded, downloads a file (Esquele.exe) from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. It then attempts to execute this file. This behavior is highly indicative of a dropper or loader malware: it downloads and executes a remote binary without user consent, uses obfuscation (base64-encoded PowerShell), and runs automatically during package installation (setup.py context). The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. All these are strong hallmarks of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages.",
