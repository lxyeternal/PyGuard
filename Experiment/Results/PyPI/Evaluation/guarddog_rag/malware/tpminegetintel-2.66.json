The PowerShell command is obfuscated and downloads/executes a remote payload from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) without user consent or notification. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign software. The use of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell, hidden process creation, and remote code retrieval and execution during package installation are all strong indicators of malware. The code is designed to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions on the victim's system.",
