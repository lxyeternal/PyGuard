      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: during installation (in the setup.py context), it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg'. If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command using subprocess.Popen and the '-EncodedCommand' flag. The base64 string decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack vector, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden process execution, and remote payload download are all strong indicators of malware. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its behavior. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
