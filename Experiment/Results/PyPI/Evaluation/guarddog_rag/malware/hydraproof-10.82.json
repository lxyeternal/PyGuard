The command is obfuscated using PowerShell's -EncodedCommand flag with a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic malware technique for stealthy execution of arbitrary or harmful code, often used to download and run additional payloads, establish persistence, or exfiltrate data. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, especially in Python package setup scripts.",
