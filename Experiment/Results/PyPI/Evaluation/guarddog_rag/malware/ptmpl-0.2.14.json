      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that, during package installation, imports the requests module and sends a GET request to https://ipinfo.io/json, printing the result. This request collects the installer's public IP address and possibly other geolocation/system information, and transmits it to an external, non-corporate server without user consent or notification. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware, as it enables exfiltration of host-specific information during installation. The use of this pattern in the setup.py install hook, combined with the lack of user interaction, logging, or legitimate business justification, makes this behavior highly suspicious and malicious. The presence of commented-out code for dynamic code execution via Fernet decryption (though not active) further elevates the risk profile, as it suggests intent or prior use of obfuscated payload delivery.",
