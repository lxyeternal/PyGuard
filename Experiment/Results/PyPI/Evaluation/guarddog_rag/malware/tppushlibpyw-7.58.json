      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the setup process of a Python package. Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then invokes them. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these characteristics are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
