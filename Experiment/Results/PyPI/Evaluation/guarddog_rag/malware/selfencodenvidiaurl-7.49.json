      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py context). Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code, downloads and runs a remote executable, and does so without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden process execution, and a try/except block to suppress errors are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
