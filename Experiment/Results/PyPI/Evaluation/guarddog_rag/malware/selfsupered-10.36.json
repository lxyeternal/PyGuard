Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery: it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code, downloads and runs a remote executable, uses obfuscation to evade detection, and suppresses all exceptions to hide failures. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and the use of a hidden PowerShell window further indicates an attempt to avoid user detection.",
