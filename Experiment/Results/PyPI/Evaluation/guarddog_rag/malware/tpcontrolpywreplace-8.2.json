This is a classic supply chain attack vector. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding and is executed only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of subprocess.Popen with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution without user consent or notification. The encoded command, when decoded, appears to download and execute a remote payload from a suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), further confirming the malicious nature. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of malware, especially in supply chain attacks targeting Python package installations.",
