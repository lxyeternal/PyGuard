Specifically, if the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks via Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote executable in this manner, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
