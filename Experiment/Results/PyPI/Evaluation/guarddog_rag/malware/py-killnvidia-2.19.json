This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed on the victim's machine without user consent or visibility. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64-encoded PowerShell command appears to download or interact with a remote resource (the encoded string contains a suspicious URL: 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0'), likely to download and execute a remote executable. This behavior is a hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks in Python packages, as it enables remote code execution during package installation. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute hidden, obfuscated PowerShell commands that download and run remote executables.",
