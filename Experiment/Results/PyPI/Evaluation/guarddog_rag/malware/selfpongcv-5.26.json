The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. The command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory and then runs it. This behavior matches several high-confidence malware patterns: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded shell commands; (2) downloading and executing code from an external source without user consent; (3) running during package installation (supply chain attack vector); (4) use of try/except to suppress errors and avoid detection; (5) lack of any legitimate business logic for such actions in a setup script. These are all strong, exclusive indicators of malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
