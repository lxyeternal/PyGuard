      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded PowerShell command decodes to a script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. It then invokes this executable, potentially compromising the system. This behavior is triggered during package installation (setup.py), making it a supply chain attack vector. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, and the obfuscation of the payload all strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware targeting the supply chain.",
