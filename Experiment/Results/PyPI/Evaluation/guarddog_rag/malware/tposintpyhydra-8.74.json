      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded PowerShell command (base64) is a classic obfuscation technique used to evade detection and deliver or execute a secondary payload. The command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation or setup, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors—obfuscated payload delivery, hidden execution, external download and execution, and error suppression—are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
