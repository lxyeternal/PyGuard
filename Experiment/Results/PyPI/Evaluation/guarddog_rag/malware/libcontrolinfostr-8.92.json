      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command. Specifically, if the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution and payload delivery. The base64-encoded payload is not transparently visible, and the command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, especially in the context of a Python package setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases the stealthiness and malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute external binaries in this manner, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
