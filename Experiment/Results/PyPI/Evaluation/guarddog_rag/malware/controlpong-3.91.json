      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (i.e., in the setup.py script). Specifically, if the 'tahg' file or directory does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a classic technique for executing obfuscated or malicious payloads on Windows systems without user consent or visibility. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence indicators of malware: (1) execution of obfuscated commands during installation, (2) downloading and running remote executables, (3) use of hidden windows to evade user detection, (4) lack of user notification or consent, and (5) suppression of all exceptions to hide errors or detection. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern targeting Python package installations.",
