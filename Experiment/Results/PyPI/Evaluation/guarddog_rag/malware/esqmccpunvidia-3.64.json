The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and encoded, which is a hallmark of malware delivery and execution. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the user's system during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. The presence of a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) in the encoded command suggests the code is likely downloading and executing a remote payload, which is a critical risk behavior.",
