(1) It sends an unsolicited notification to a hardcoded Discord webhook upon execution, which is a classic data exfiltration or beaconing technique used by malware to notify an attacker of a new infection. (2) It clones a remote GitHub repository (which could be attacker-controlled) to a local directory without user consent or notification. (3) It then changes the working directory to the cloned repository and executes a Python script ('bypass.py') from that repository using subprocess.run. This sequence enables the attacker to deliver and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, a hallmark of remote code execution and supply chain attacks. (4) There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate business logic for these actions. (5) The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook, combined with remote code fetching and execution, is a pattern observed exclusively in malware samples and never in benign software. These behaviors together constitute a critical risk and are highly indicative of malicious intent.",
