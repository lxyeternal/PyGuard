Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where arbitrary code is executed on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the obfuscated payload, and the lack of any legitimate business logic further confirm the malicious intent.",
