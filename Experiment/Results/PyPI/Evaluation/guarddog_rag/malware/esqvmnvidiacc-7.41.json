      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and, when decoded, is likely to download and execute a payload from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and save it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then execute it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution technique, commonly used in supply chain attacks via Python package installation scripts. The use of PowerShell in hidden mode, encoded commands, and the download/execution of a remote executable are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code is obfuscated, lacks user interaction or consent, and is designed to evade detection. The presence of a try/except block to suppress errors further increases its stealthiness.",
