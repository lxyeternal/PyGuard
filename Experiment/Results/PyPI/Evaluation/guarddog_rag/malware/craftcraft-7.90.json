The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The command downloads and executes a file from an external, non-transparent URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware: it downloads and executes a remote binary without user consent, uses obfuscation to evade detection, and attempts to hide its execution. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and malicious PyPI packages.",
