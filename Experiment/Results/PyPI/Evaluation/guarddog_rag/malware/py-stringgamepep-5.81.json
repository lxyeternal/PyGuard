      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded payload. The payload is base64-encoded and passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious code on Windows systems. The command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then invokes them. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, specifically a supply chain attack or dropper, as it enables remote code execution, persistence, and further compromise of the victim's system. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a package setup script.",
