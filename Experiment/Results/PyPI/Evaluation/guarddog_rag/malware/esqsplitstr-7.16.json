      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command during the package setup process, specifically if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command is passed to 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...', which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The command downloads and executes a remote file (likely an executable) from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then invokes it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code download and execution, obfuscation via base64 encoding, execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector), and lack of user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. There is no legitimate reason for a Python package setup script to perform these actions.",
