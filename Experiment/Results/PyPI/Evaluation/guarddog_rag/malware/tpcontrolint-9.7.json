      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process of a Python package (in the setup.py file). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code execution, payload download and execution, obfuscation via base64 encoding, execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector), and use of a suspicious external domain. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
