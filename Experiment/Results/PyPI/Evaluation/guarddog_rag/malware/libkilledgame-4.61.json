      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory ('tahg'), and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The encoded command (base64) is passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for executing obfuscated or hidden payloads on Windows systems. The command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious external domain (github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then invokes it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner, especially without user consent or notification. This behavior is strongly associated with malware and is never observed in benign software.",
