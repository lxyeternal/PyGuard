The command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) using Invoke-WebRequest, saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe', and then executes them. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: arbitrary code execution is triggered during package installation, with no user interaction or notification, and the payload is both obfuscated and fetched from an external, untrusted source. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
