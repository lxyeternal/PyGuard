      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command during the installation process (in the setup.py script) if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the command. Decoding the base64 reveals that it downloads an executable ('Esquele.exe') from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. It then attempts to execute this file. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware: it enables remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential system compromise without user consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner.",
