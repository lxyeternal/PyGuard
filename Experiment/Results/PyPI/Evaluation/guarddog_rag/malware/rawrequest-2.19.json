Specifically, it checks for the absence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if not present, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes remote files from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (esquelesquad.000webhostapp.com/xEsqueleSquad.exe and WindowsCache.exe). This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote payload delivery is strongly associated with malware and is never observed in benign Python packages.",
