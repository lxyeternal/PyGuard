      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command that downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) using the -EncodedCommand flag. This is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution and remote payload delivery. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW ensures the process is hidden from the user. The code is triggered during package installation (setup.py), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The presence of a silent try/except block further suppresses errors and hides malicious activity. All these behaviors are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign code.",
