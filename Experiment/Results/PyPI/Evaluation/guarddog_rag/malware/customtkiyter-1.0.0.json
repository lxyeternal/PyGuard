      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly indicative of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack via a Python package. The setup.py script defines a custom install command (with an obfuscated, randomly generated class name) that, during installation, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet. The payload is not visible in the source code, making its intent and actions opaque, but this pattern (encrypted payload + exec at install time) is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages. The code only runs on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), further suggesting targeted malicious intent. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic for this dynamic code execution. The use of strong obfuscation, encrypted payloads, and dynamic execution during installation is never observed in benign packages and is a critical risk indicator.",
