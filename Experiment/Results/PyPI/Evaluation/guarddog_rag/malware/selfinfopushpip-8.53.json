      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed on the victim's machine without user consent or visibility. The command is triggered during package installation (in setup.py), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The base64 payload, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior enables remote code execution, potential system compromise, and persistence. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
