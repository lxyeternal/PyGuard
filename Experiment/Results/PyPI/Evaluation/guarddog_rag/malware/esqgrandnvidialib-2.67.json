The encoded command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscation, silent execution, and a suspicious remote endpoint are all strong indicators of malware. The code also suppresses all errors, further hiding its behavior. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware.",
