      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory ('tahg'), and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command. The encoded command is base64-encoded PowerShell, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack via a malicious Python package: the code runs automatically during installation (setup.py), downloads and executes a remote binary without user consent, and attempts to evade detection by hiding the PowerShell window. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never found in benign packages.",
