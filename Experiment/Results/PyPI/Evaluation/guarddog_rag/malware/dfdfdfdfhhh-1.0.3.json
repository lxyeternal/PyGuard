      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It abuses the Python package installation process by defining a custom install command (CustomInstallCommand) that executes a large, obfuscated, base64-encoded payload at install time via exec. The decoded payload (when base64-decoded) contains code that: (1) collects sensitive user and system information (e.g., username, directory paths), (2) creates and writes files in sensitive user directories, (3) downloads and executes additional payloads (including .exe and .vbs files) from remote sources, (4) spawns shell processes (including PowerShell and Pythonw) with arbitrary commands, (5) attempts to establish persistence and/or exfiltrate data, and (6) does all of this without user consent, logging, or legitimate purpose. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and system modification during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and Python malware. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a package claiming to be a 'simplified version of urllib'.",
