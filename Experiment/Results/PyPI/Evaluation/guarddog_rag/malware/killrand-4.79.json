The command is obfuscated and uses '-WindowStyle Hidden' to suppress the PowerShell window, a classic malware evasion technique. The base64-encoded payload, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote, hardcoded, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where arbitrary code is executed on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or awareness. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and analysis. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
