      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior. The 'execute' function downloads a list of executables from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt), then downloads and writes additional executables from the same server to disk, sets executable permissions, and immediately executes them using os.system. This is a classic malware pattern for remote code execution and payload delivery. Furthermore, the code is structured to run this behavior every time any HTTP method (get, post, put, patch, delete, head, options, request) is called, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious wrappers. There is no user notification, validation, or legitimate business logic for these actions. The use of a hardcoded IP, lack of error handling, and direct execution of remote binaries are all strong indicators of malware, with no benign justification.",
