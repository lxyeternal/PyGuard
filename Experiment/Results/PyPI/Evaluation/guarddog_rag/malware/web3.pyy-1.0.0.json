The setup.py script defines a custom install command (with an obfuscated class name) that, during installation, checks if the OS is Windows and then imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' (from the cryptography package). It proceeds to decrypt an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This is a classic malware delivery technique: the actual payload is hidden (encrypted) and only revealed and executed at install time, making static analysis difficult. The use of obfuscated class names, lack of legitimate package functionality, and execution of hidden code during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in supply chain attacks.",
