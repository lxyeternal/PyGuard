The encoded PowerShell command (EncodedCommand) is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. The command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then invokes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation (setup.py), enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise without user consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware and is never present in benign software.",
