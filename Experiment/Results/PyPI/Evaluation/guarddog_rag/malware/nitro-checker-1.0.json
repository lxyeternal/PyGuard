The decoded payload imports modules for file and process manipulation (tempfile, sys, os), writes a Python script to a temporary file, and then downloads and executes additional code from a remote URL (https://z3us.online/grab/miYOxGLuqZNlRESL). This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is embedded in a setup.py file to execute during package installation. The code is obfuscated, lacks user consent, downloads and executes remote code, and attempts to clean up after itself, all of which are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup.py to perform these actions, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware.",
