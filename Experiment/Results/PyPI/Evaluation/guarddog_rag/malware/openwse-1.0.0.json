      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It abuses the Python package installation process by defining a custom install command (via cmdclass in setup.py) that executes arbitrary, hidden code during installation. Specifically, the custom install class imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts and immediately executes (via exec) an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and ciphertext. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern seen in malicious PyPI packages. The payload is hidden from static analysis, and its purpose is obfuscated, but the use of dynamic code execution (exec) on decrypted data is a hallmark of malware. The code only runs on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), further indicating targeted malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute hidden, encrypted code at install time, especially without user consent or transparency. The use of obfuscated class names, lack of documentation, and suspicious metadata further reinforce the malicious nature.",
