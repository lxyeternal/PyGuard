      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it imports subprocess and os, checks for the absence of a file named 'tahg', and then spawns a hidden PowerShell process using an encoded command. The encoded PowerShell command (base64) is a classic obfuscation technique used to evade detection and deliver further payloads. The command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This behavior is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in the setup script, runs automatically during installation, and attempts to download and execute additional malware. The use of a hidden window, encoded command, and silent error suppression (broad try/except) further indicate malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware.",
