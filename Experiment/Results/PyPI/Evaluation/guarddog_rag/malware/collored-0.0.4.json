It automatically downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://rentry.co/2sv84/raw), saves it to a sensitive user directory (the user's Temp folder), and immediately executes it without any user interaction, consent, or validation. The use of threading to run this process in the background further increases stealth. There is no error handling, logging, or legitimate business logic present. The pattern of remote payload retrieval followed by immediate execution is a classic hallmark of malware droppers and is not observed in benign software. The code is designed to facilitate remote code execution and potential system compromise.",
