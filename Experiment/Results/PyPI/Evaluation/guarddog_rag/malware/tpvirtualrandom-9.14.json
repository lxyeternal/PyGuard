      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py script). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and attempts to run it, as well as another executable (WindowsCache.exe) from the user's home directory. This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns: executing obfuscated commands, downloading and running remote executables, hiding execution from the user, and embedding this logic in a setup script to trigger during package installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks). There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and the code is designed to evade detection (e.g., by hiding the window and suppressing all exceptions).",
