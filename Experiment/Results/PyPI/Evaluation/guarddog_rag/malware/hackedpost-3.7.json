Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64 string decodes to a command that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is triggered during package installation, downloads and executes remote code without user consent, and uses obfuscation and exception suppression to evade detection. These behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
