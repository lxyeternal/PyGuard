      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the package installation process (in the setup.py script). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never seen in benign software. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, and the execution of code during installation further confirm the malicious intent.",
