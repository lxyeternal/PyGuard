Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user interaction, and the obfuscated payload further confirm the malicious intent.",
