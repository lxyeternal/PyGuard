      "malicious_behavior": "The code on line 13 uses base64 decoding to hide a payload, which is then compiled and executed at runtime via builtins.exec. The decoded payload (when decoded) performs the following actions: (1) Imports modules for temporary file creation, system command execution, and file system manipulation. (2) Writes a Python script to a temporary file that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (http://wasp.plague.fun/inject/5OMHH3DGlNjKXj4n). (3) Attempts to execute the downloaded code, replacing '.exe' with '.w.exe' in the filename, and suppresses all exceptions. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious code is embedded in the setup script, is obfuscated via base64, and is executed automatically during package installation. It downloads and executes remote code, which is a critical risk and a hallmark of malware. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and remote payload delivery is never seen in benign software and is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
