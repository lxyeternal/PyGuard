If it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using a base64-encoded command. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-standard domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a classic malware dropper pattern: it downloads and runs a remote payload without user interaction, using obfuscation (base64 encoding), stealth (hidden window), and error suppression (broad try/except). The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never found in benign software.",
