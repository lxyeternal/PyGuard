It uses eval and dynamic code execution, which are classic hallmarks of malware. The code reconstructs and decodes large binary payloads at runtime, then executes them without any user interaction, logging, or error handling. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially supply chain attacks, as it allows arbitrary code execution and payload delivery while evading static analysis. The presence of dynamic imports, runtime decoding, and immediate execution of the decoded payload, all without any legitimate business logic or user consent, is a critical risk indicator. There is no evidence of benign intent or legitimate application logic.",

It decodes and executes multiple layers of encoded data (base64, possibly zlib, and other codecs), which is a classic malware technique to hide its true payload and evade static analysis. The code dynamically reconstructs and executes additional code at runtime, with no user interaction, logging, or legitimate business logic. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution, payload delivery, and potentially data exfiltration or system compromise. The presence of multiple decoding steps, dynamic imports, and immediate execution of reconstructed code are all critical risk indicators found exclusively in malicious samples. There is no evidence of legitimate functionality, and the code structure matches known supply chain attack and loader malware patterns.",
