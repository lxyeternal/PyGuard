      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior, particularly those associated with supply chain attacks in Python packages. Specifically: (1) It creates a temporary Python file containing code that downloads and executes further code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/yoodz/raw) using exec(). (2) It then launches a new process to execute this temporary file, using a modified Python executable name (replacing .exe with w.exe), which is a known evasion technique. (3) The remote code is executed without any validation, user notification, or consent, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. (4) The code is embedded in a setup.py file, meaning it will run during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. (5) The use of obfuscated variable names and indirect imports further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
