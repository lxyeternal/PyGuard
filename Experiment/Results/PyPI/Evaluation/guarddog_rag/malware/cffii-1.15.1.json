The parameters are static, not derived from user input or external sources, and there is no evidence of dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The code is part of a typical setup/build script for a C extension (likely for the cffi package), and all subprocess usage is for legitimate build-time environment detection. There are no suspicious network operations, credential access, or persistence mechanisms. This pattern is common in open-source, well-documented projects and does not match any of the high-risk or critical-risk malicious behaviors described above.",
