      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It abuses the setuptools install hook by defining a custom install command (with an obfuscated, randomly generated class name) that executes arbitrary, encrypted code during package installation. Specifically, in the run() method, it checks if the OS is Windows, then imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' (from the cryptography library), decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code with exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden via encryption, only executed on Windows, and is run automatically during installation without user consent. The use of obfuscation, encrypted payloads, dynamic code execution, and execution in a setup script are all strong indicators of malware, as confirmed by the provided knowledge points. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute hidden, encrypted code during installation, especially with no user interaction or transparency.",
