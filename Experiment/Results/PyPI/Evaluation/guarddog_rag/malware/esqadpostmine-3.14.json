      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The command is obfuscated using base64 encoding and is passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The decoded command downloads and executes a remote file (likely a malicious executable) from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, specifically a supply chain attack or dropper, as it executes arbitrary code during package installation or setup, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. All these characteristics match critical risk indicators for Python malware, especially in the context of malicious PyPI packages.",
