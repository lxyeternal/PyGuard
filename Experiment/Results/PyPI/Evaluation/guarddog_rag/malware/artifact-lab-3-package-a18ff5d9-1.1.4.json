This is a classic data exfiltration pattern, as environment variables often contain sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, and configuration secrets. The exfiltration function (notmalfunc) is executed both during package installation (via custom setuptools install/develop hooks) and unconditionally at the end of the script, ensuring the data is sent regardless of how the package is used. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate justification for this behavior. The use of a hardcoded, non-corporate, disposable endpoint (ngrok) further increases suspicion. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware, and is never observed in benign packages.",
