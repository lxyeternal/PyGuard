      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information (username, hostname, current working directory) and exfiltrates this data to an external, suspicious domain (https://bfad8061.pwnie.me) using base64 encoding, which is a common obfuscation and exfiltration technique in malware. The exfiltration occurs automatically during the package installation process by abusing the setuptools 'install' command via a custom PostInstallCommand class, a known supply chain attack vector. Additionally, the code executes a shell command ('curl https://vulnerable.bfad8061.pwnie.me') without user consent or notification, which could be used to download and execute further malicious payloads or signal to a command-and-control server. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and all actions are performed without user interaction or consent. These patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign software.",
