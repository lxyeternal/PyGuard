      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py file). Specifically, if the 'tahg' path does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and executing potentially malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs them. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code execution, payload download and execution, obfuscation via base64 encoding, execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector), and lack of user notification or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in supply chain attacks.",
