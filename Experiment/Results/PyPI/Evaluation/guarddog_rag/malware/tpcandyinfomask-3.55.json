      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if not present, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command. The encoded command is executed in a hidden window (using -WindowStyle Hidden and subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW), which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of malicious payloads. The base64-encoded PowerShell command appears to download and/or execute further code from a remote, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and running it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in a setup script, runs automatically on install, and attempts to download and execute a remote payload without user consent or notification. The use of broad try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never justified in benign software.",
