      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, including: (1) Heavy obfuscation of both logic and data, with meaningless variable names, indirect function calls, and use of dynamic code execution (e.g., exec, eval, compile) on obfuscated or dynamically constructed payloads. (2) The presence of large, compressed, and/or encoded binary blobs (e.g., b'x\\x9c...') that are passed to functions in a way consistent with payload unpacking and execution. (3) Use of __import__, eval, and compile with obfuscated arguments, which is a classic technique for hiding the true intent and enabling arbitrary code execution. (4) The code is structured to execute additional code at runtime, including via Math.execute and via lambda chains that ultimately call eval/exec on dynamically generated code. (5) The code is designed to run upon import or execution (e.g., in the __main__ block), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages. (6) There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying this behavior. (7) The code is labeled as being obfuscated by 'Hyperion', a known obfuscator used in malware. (8) The code includes suspicious, non-descriptive variable and class names (e.g., StackOverflow, Math, Power) and uses try/except blocks to suppress errors, further hiding its true behavior. (9) The code includes patterns such as decompressing and executing code, dynamic imports, and indirect execution, all of which are strongly associated with malware and never seen in benign software. (10) The code is consistent with known malicious PyPI supply chain attacks, where obfuscated code is executed during installation or import, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further payload delivery.",
