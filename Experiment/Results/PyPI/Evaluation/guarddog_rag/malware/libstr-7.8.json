Specifically, if the 'tahg' file or directory does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a classic technique for executing obfuscated or malicious payloads on Windows systems. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs them. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where arbitrary code is executed on the user's system during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and external payload delivery are all strong indicators of malware.",
