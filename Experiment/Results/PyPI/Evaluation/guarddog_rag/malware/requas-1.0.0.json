      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that, during package installation, checks if the OS is Windows and then dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet'. It uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload and immediately executes the decrypted code using exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden and obfuscated, only decrypted and executed at install time, which allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of dynamic imports, encrypted payloads, and execution during installation are all strong indicators of malware, especially as there is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware and supply chain attacks.",
