The command is obfuscated and is triggered if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the user's system during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of '-EncodedCommand' with a base64 string is a classic technique for delivering and executing malicious payloads, often used to download and run additional malware or exfiltrate data. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and evade detection. The presence of a suspicious comment ('www.esquelesquad.rip'), a non-standard package name, and the lack of any legitimate business logic further confirm the malicious intent.",
