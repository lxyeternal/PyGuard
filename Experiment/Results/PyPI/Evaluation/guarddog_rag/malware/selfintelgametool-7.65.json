The command is base64-encoded and obfuscated, which is a classic malware technique to evade detection. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote payload from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign Python packages. The use of a hidden process, encoded PowerShell, and remote payload execution during installation is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malware.",
