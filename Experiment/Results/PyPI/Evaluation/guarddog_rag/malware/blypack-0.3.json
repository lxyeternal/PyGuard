This command spawns an interactive bash shell and connects it to a remote IP address (81.46.246.181) on port 4444, effectively creating a reverse shell. This allows a remote attacker to gain full command-line access to the victim's system without their knowledge or consent. The function is called automatically at the end of the script, ensuring the payload is executed upon installation or execution of the setup script. This pattern is a classic indicator of a supply chain attack, commonly observed in malicious Python packages, and is never present in benign software. There is no legitimate reason for a package setup script to open a reverse shell to an external IP address.",
