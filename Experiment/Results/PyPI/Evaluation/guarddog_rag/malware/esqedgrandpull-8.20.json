      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a highly obfuscated PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and run in hidden window mode, which is a classic malware technique for stealthy payload delivery, remote code execution, or further compromise. The encoded command downloads and/or executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and malware delivery, especially in the context of a Python package setup script, which will execute automatically during installation. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner.",
