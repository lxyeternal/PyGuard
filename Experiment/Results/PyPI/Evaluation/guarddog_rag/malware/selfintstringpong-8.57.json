This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The decoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (esquelesquad.000webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquadesquadax.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This behavior is triggered during package installation (setup.py context), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, and the obfuscation of the payload all strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner.",
