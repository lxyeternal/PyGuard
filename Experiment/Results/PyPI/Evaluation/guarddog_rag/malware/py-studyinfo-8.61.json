      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command during the package setup phase, specifically if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and executed with '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a classic technique for stealthy execution. The encoded command downloads and/or executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded shell commands; (2) downloading and executing a remote executable without user consent; (3) running during package installation (supply chain attack vector); (4) use of try/except to suppress errors and avoid detection; (5) no user notification or legitimate business logic for such actions. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware.",
