      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (i.e., in setup.py). Specifically, if the 'tahg' file or directory does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and executes them. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise without user consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute remote binaries in this manner.",
