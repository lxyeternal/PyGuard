The command is obfuscated and is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of '-EncodedCommand' with a long base64 string is a hallmark of malware, as it hides the true intent of the command from static analysis. This behavior is triggered automatically when the package is installed, making it a supply chain attack vector. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its activity. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute an obfuscated PowerShell command in this manner, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples.",
