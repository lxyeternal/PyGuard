Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is triggered during package installation, is obfuscated, downloads and executes a remote payload, and uses exception suppression to evade detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
