The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file (Esquele.exe) from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered automatically during installation (via setup.py), uses obfuscation to evade detection, downloads and executes a potentially malicious payload from a remote server, and does so without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign Python packages.",
