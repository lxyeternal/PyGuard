It creates a temporary Python file containing code that downloads and executes additional Python code from a remote, hardcoded URL (https://pub-419bfb1465754687a6ed3a1145bf7202.r2.dev/lSnPxksiKyOTXyT1) using urllib. The downloaded code is immediately executed via exec, enabling arbitrary code execution from an attacker-controlled server. The code then attempts to execute this temporary file using a potentially renamed Python executable (pythonw.exe) via a shell command, which would run the payload without a visible console window, further hiding its activity. The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of user interaction or consent, suppression of errors, and execution of remote code during the setup process are all hallmarks of supply chain attacks and Python malware. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
