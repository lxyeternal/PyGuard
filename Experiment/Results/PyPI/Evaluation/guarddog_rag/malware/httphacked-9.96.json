      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command during the package setup phase, specifically if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and executed with '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, non-transparent URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware: remote payload download and execution, obfuscation via base64 encoding, execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector), and lack of user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. There is no legitimate reason for a Python package setup script to download and execute a remote executable in this manner.",
