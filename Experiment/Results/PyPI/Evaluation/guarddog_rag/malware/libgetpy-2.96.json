      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell commands to be executed without user knowledge. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command appears to download and/or execute content from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0), and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in a setup script, so it will run automatically when the package is installed, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. All of these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
