Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand', which is a classic malware technique for stealthy payload delivery and execution. The base64-encoded payload is highly suspicious and is a hallmark of obfuscated malware, often used to download and execute further malicious code or exfiltrate data. The use of broad try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and analysis. This behavior is not found in benign software and is a well-known vector for supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem.",
