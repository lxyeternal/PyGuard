      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is provided as a long, base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The command is executed with the window hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and with the creation flag to suppress the window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), further indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The encoded payload, when decoded, appears to download and execute a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and then runs it, which is a hallmark of malware delivery and execution. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a well-known vector for supply chain attacks, especially in Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors and the presence of a suspicious author and email further increase the risk.",
