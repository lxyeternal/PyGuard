Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell, hidden window execution, and remote payload download are all strong indicators of malware. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and evade detection. The package metadata (author, email, etc.) is also suspicious and does not justify this behavior.",
