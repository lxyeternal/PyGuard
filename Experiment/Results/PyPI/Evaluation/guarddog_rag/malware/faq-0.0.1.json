The decoded payloads (when decoded) perform the following actions: (1) Download a payload from a hardcoded external IP address (http://137.117.157.128/inject/...), (2) Write the downloaded content to a temporary file, (3) Attempt to execute the downloaded file as a process, and (4) Clean up the temporary file. This is a classic pattern of a supply chain attack, where arbitrary code is executed during package installation or setup, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic code execution (exec), and hardcoded external endpoints are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate justification for this behavior in a setup script.",
