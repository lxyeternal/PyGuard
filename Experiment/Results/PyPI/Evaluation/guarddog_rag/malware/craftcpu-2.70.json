      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a long, base64-encoded command. The command is passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious payloads on Windows systems. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW ensures the process is invisible to the user, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The base64 payload decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file from a remote server (the URL is obfuscated in the encoded string), which is a classic malware delivery and execution technique. This behavior is highly indicative of a supply chain attack, as the code is placed in a setup.py file, meaning it will execute automatically during package installation, without user consent or awareness. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these characteristics match critical risk indicators for Python malware, especially in the context of supply chain attacks.",
