The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) using Invoke-WebRequest, saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and then executing it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where arbitrary code is executed on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent during package installation. The use of obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell, hidden window execution, and remote payload retrieval are all strong, exclusive indicators of malware. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script, and it matches multiple high-confidence malware signatures.",
