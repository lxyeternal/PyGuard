      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: (1) It uses heavy obfuscation, including non-descriptive variable names, lambda functions, and multi-layered encoding (base64, zlib, codecs) to hide its true intent. (2) It dynamically reconstructs and executes code using eval and exec on decoded payloads, a classic technique for arbitrary code execution and payload delivery. (3) The code contains a large, obfuscated data blob and decodes it at runtime, which is a hallmark of malware attempting to evade static analysis. (4) There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation; the code's sole purpose is to decode and execute hidden payloads. (5) The use of setattribute on __builtins__ to overwrite built-in functions (e.g., print, exec, eval) is a known technique for hijacking or suppressing standard behavior, often used by malware to evade detection or control execution flow. (6) The code is structured to execute during import or installation, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. All these factors, especially the combination of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and lack of legitimate functionality, are exclusive to malware and are never seen in benign software.",
