The encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file (Esquele.exe) from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com) and attempts to run another executable (WindowsCache.exe) from the user's home directory. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded payloads; (2) downloading and executing code from an external source without user consent; (3) use of PowerShell in hidden mode to evade detection; (4) execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector); (5) lack of user interaction, logging, or legitimate justification. These patterns are exclusively observed in malware and are never present in benign software.",
