It overrides the setuptools install command (via the GruppeInstall class) to execute hidden, encrypted code during package installation, specifically on Windows systems. The payload is stored as an encrypted blob and decrypted at runtime using Fernet, then executed with exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious code is not visible in the source, is obfuscated/encrypted to evade detection, and is executed automatically when the package is installed, without user consent or interaction. The use of requests and cryptography (fernet) modules, combined with dynamic code execution, is a hallmark of Python malware. There is no legitimate reason for a setup.py to execute hidden, encrypted code on install, especially with no user notification or documentation. This matches multiple critical risk indicators: dynamic code execution, obfuscation, execution during install, and potential for remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
