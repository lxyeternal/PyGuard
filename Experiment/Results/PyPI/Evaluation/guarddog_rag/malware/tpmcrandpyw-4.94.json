Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is triggered during package installation, without user consent or notification, and downloads and executes a potentially harmful executable from an external source. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
