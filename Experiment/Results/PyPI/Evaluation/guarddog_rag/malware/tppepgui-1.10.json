      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed without user consent or visibility. The command is triggered during package installation (in the setup.py context), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) in the encoded command suggests the code is designed to download and possibly execute additional payloads from an external server. The presence of a try/except block that suppresses all exceptions further indicates an attempt to evade detection and ensure execution. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
