      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded payload. The payload is base64-encoded and is executed with -WindowStyle Hidden, which is a classic technique for stealthy execution of malicious commands on Windows systems. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest, saving it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, and then executes it. This behavior is a textbook example of a dropper: it downloads and runs a remote executable without user consent, using obfuscation and stealth techniques. The code is embedded in a try/except block at the top of a setup.py file, meaning it will run automatically during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script, and all observed patterns (obfuscated payload, hidden execution, remote code download and execution, lack of user interaction, and execution during install) are exclusive to malware.",
