Specifically, if the 'tahg' directory does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command in hidden mode with an encoded payload. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is executed automatically during installation or setup, without user consent or notification. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands is a well-known technique for evading static analysis and delivering further payloads, such as downloading and executing additional malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection, further supporting its malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute hidden, obfuscated PowerShell commands, especially from a suspicious or undocumented source.",
