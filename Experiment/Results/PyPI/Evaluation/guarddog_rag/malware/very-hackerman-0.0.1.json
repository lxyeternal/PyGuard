First, it executes code at install time via a try/except block that imports 'requests', sends a POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook (a common exfiltration method), and then executes a large, obfuscated base64-encoded payload using exec. The payload itself is further obfuscated and appears to perform additional network communication and code execution, possibly including data exfiltration or remote code execution. The use of base64 decoding, exec, and the lack of user interaction or consent, combined with the presence of hardcoded external endpoints, are all critical risk indicators. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware, especially in supply chain attacks via Python packages. The code is designed to run automatically during package installation, which is a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks.",
