If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic malware technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious commands on the victim's system without their knowledge. The use of a hidden window, encoded command, and the presence of a suspicious URL (as seen in the decoded payload) strongly indicate that the code is designed to download and/or execute further malicious payloads, establish persistence, or exfiltrate data. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem.",
