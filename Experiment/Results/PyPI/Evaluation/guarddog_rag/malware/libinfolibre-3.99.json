      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (i.e., in the setup.py context). The command is obfuscated and is executed only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern: it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code, downloads a potentially malicious executable, and runs it without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these characteristics are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign Python packages.",
