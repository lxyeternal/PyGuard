      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a credential and information stealer, exhibiting multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive data from the victim's system, including Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and wallet files. It exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...), as well as to transfer.sh (an anonymous file hosting service). The code programmatically kills browser and wallet processes to access locked files, decrypts browser-stored credentials using Windows APIs, and searches the user's Desktop, Downloads, and Documents for files containing sensitive keywords (e.g., 'password', 'wallet', 'crypto'). It uses subprocess.Popen with shell=True to execute commands, including installing dependencies and killing processes, which is a common evasion and persistence technique. The code is designed to run automatically, likely during package installation (as it is embedded in a setup.py context), and provides no user notification or consent. The presence of try/except blocks to suppress errors, dynamic dependency installation, and multi-threaded data collection further indicate attempts to evade detection and maximize data theft. All of these behaviors are hallmarks of information-stealing malware and supply chain attacks.",
