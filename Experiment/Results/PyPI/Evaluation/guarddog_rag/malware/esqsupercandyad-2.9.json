      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the setup process if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and includes the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for hiding the true intent of the command and is strongly associated with malware. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code execution, payload delivery, obfuscation, execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector), and use of try/except to suppress errors and evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner, and the use of obfuscation and hidden execution further confirms malicious intent.",
