Upon decoding, the payload performs the following malicious actions: (1) collects the current user's login name and constructs file paths in the user's AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\System64 directory, (2) writes and executes multiple files with obfuscated or generic names (e.g., WIN32.vbs, WIN32.bat, runtime.zip, pythonw.exe, stub.pyw), (3) downloads and executes remote content from hardcoded external URLs (e.g., https://api-hw.com/dl/runtime, https://api-hw.com/dl/w), (4) uses subprocess and os modules to spawn processes and run shell commands, (5) attempts to persist files in system directories, (6) exfiltrates or manipulates data without user consent, and (7) uses obfuscation and error suppression to evade detection. The presence of this payload in a setup script (setup.py) means it will execute during package installation, making it a classic supply chain attack. All of these behaviors are strong, exclusive indicators of malware, especially in the context of a Python package.",
