      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation (i.e., when a user runs pip install), executes an encrypted payload. Specifically, the install hook imports 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypts an encrypted byte string using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the decrypted payload could perform arbitrary actions, such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or system compromise, all without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in the context of typosquatted or suspicious PyPI packages.",
