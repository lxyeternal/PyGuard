This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python packages. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and is likely used to download and execute a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), as indicated by the decoded command. The use of subprocess.Popen with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' is a classic technique for stealthy execution of malicious code. The code is triggered if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The presence of a try/except block that suppresses all exceptions further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute such a command, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples.",
