      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and executed in hidden mode, which is a classic technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. The encoded PowerShell command appears to download and execute a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and executing it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, specifically a supply chain attack or dropper, as it enables remote code execution on the victim's system without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of malicious activity.",
