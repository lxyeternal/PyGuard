      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with the -EncodedCommand flag. The command is base64-encoded, which is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. The decoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in a setup script, so it will run automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All of these behaviors—obfuscated payload delivery, remote code execution, hidden process spawning, and lack of user interaction—are strong, exclusive indicators of malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
