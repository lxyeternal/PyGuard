      "malicious_behavior": "This setup.py script is highly malicious. It overrides the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary, encrypted code during package installation, specifically on Windows systems. The code imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then uses Fernet to decrypt an encrypted payload and immediately executes it with exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden (encrypted), only decrypted at install time, and executed without user knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscated class names, a typosquatted package name ('BeautifuoSoup' instead of 'BeautifulSoup'), and the presence of suspicious metadata further confirm malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup.py to execute encrypted, hidden code during installation, especially with no user interaction, logging, or documentation. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware and is a critical risk for remote code execution and system compromise.",
