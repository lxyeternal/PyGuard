      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (via cmdclass in setup.py) that executes arbitrary, encrypted code during package installation. Specifically, the run() method of the custom install class imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts and immediately executes a payload using exec(). The decryption key and encrypted payload are hardcoded, and the decrypted code is executed only on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python packages, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the installer's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscated class names, lack of legitimate business logic, and the presence of encrypted payloads executed at install time are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This technique is never observed in benign software and is a critical risk for remote code execution and system compromise.",
