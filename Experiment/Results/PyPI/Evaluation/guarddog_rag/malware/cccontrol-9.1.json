The encoded command is passed to PowerShell using the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of arbitrary or malicious payloads. The command appears to download and/or execute further code from a remote server (the encoded string contains a URL: 'http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0'), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware: it downloads and executes a remote payload without user consent, uses obfuscation to evade detection, runs in a hidden window, and is triggered during package installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks). The use of broad try/except blocks to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions.",
