The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it to a hidden location (WindowsCache.exe). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: it abuses the package installation process to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell, hidden process execution, and remote payload retrieval are all strong indicators of malware. The code is not required for any legitimate package installation and is designed to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions.",
