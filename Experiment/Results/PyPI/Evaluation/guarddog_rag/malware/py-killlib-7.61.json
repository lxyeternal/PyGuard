Specifically, it checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden and executed at install time, without user consent or notification. The use of subprocess.Popen with a hidden window and encoded PowerShell command is a strong indicator of malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution, remote payload delivery, and evasion of static analysis. The domain in the encoded command (dl.dropbox.com) is used to download further payloads, which is a hallmark of malware delivery. This behavior is never observed in benign software and matches multiple high-confidence malware indicators, including obfuscated payload delivery, hidden process execution, and execution during package installation.",
