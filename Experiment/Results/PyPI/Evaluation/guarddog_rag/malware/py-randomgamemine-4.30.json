      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command during package installation or import (in the setup.py context). The command is obfuscated and, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) using PowerShell, saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and executing it. This is a classic supply chain attack vector, as it abuses the package setup process to achieve remote code execution on the victim's machine without user consent. The use of '-WindowStyle Hidden' suppresses the PowerShell window, further indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection, another hallmark of malware. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
