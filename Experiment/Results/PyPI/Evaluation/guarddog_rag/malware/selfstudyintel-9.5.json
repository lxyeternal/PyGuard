The encoded PowerShell command is not transparently visible, but the use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a well-known malware technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. This behavior is highly indicative of malicious activity, especially in the context of a Python package setup script, as it enables remote code execution on the victim's system without user consent or notification. The code is also wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection, another hallmark of malware. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' further increases suspicion. This pattern is consistently associated with supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign software.",
