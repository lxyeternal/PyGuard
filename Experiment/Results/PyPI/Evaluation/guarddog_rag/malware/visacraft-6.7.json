      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py script). Specifically, it checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9yzbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where arbitrary code is executed on the user's system during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and external payload download are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its behavior.",
