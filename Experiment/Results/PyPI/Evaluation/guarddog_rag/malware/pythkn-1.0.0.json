It defines a custom setuptools install command (dgtHeWbMbgxPHaJrPpBbAkTeiztqRbFjQVjNSXLrFKYDpmTuEEwfBWBddFEzNUOgKrHY) that, during package installation on Windows systems, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and Python malware: it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, with the actual payload hidden and obfuscated via encryption. The use of obfuscated class names, lack of legitimate business logic, and execution of decrypted code at install time are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no user notification, documentation, or legitimate reason for this behavior. The package metadata (name, author, description) is also suspicious and non-descriptive, further supporting the assessment that this is a malicious package, likely designed to evade detection and deliver a hidden payload.",
