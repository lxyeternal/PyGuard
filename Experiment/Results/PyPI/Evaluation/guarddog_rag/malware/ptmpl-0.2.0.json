This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious PyPI packages. The invoked function (download_and_run_script) is not shown here, but the naming strongly suggests it downloads and executes code from a remote source. This enables arbitrary code execution on the installer's machine without user consent, which is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malware. The use of subprocess to run Python code during installation, especially code that likely contacts external servers, is never observed in benign packages and is a classic malware delivery technique.",
