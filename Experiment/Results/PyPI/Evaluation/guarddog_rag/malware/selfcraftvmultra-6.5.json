      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed on the victim's machine without user consent or visibility. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64-encoded PowerShell command appears to download and/or execute further code from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides the malicious activity. Embedding this logic in a setup script means it will be triggered during package installation, making it a supply chain attack vector. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
