      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command (base64-encoded), which is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, or further compromise. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and downloads or executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is done without user consent, logging, or legitimate justification, and is triggered automatically if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and malicious PyPI packages, as it enables remote code execution on the victim's system during package installation or setup.",
