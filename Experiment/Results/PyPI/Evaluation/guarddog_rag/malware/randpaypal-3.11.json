      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py script). Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: executing arbitrary, obfuscated, and remotely controlled code during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the obfuscation via base64, the use of a non-corporate file-sharing service (Dropbox), and the execution of a downloaded binary are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
