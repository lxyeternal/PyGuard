      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a credential-stealing malware (infostealer) and remote access trojan (RAT). It exhibits multiple critical risk behaviors exclusively associated with malware: (1) It collects highly sensitive data from the victim's system, including WiFi passwords, Chrome saved passwords, Chrome cookies, and Discord tokens from various browsers. (2) It exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1078733828820054216/...), which is a classic data exfiltration technique. (3) It can establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. (4) It uses subprocess with shell=True to run system commands, increasing the risk of arbitrary code execution. (5) It operates without user consent or notification, and attempts to upload files containing sensitive data to external file hosting services. (6) The code is labeled as 'EvilPIP Malware' and references a GitHub repository for a known malicious tool. (7) The code is not obfuscated, but the intent and actions are clearly malicious, with no legitimate use case for such broad and invasive data collection and exfiltration. All these behaviors match critical risk indicators and are never found in benign software.",
