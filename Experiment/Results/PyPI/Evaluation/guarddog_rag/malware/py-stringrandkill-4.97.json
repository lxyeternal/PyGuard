Specifically, it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden from static analysis, is executed without user consent, and is triggered during package installation. The PowerShell command appears to download and execute a file from an external, suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), which is a common technique for delivering secondary malware payloads. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW ensures the process is hidden from the user, further indicating malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages.",
