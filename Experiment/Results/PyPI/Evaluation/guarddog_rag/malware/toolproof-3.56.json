      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command with a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (i.e., in setup.py). This is triggered if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is obfuscated using the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a common technique in malware to hide the true intent of the command and evade detection. The base64 string decodes to a command that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: execution of obfuscated code during installation, remote payload download and execution, use of hidden process windows, and lack of user notification or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is embedded in a package's installation script to compromise user systems.",
