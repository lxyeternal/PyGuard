This function collects sensitive system information (OS version, platform, uptime, and local IP address) and exfiltrates it to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64:9090) via a raw TCP socket, without user consent or notification. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware, as it abuses the package installation process to run arbitrary code and leak host-specific data to an attacker-controlled server. The use of a misleading package name ('numoy', similar to 'numpy'), lack of legitimate business logic, and absence of user-facing features further reinforce the malicious intent.",
