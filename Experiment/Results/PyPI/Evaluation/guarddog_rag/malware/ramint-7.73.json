The encoded command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs them. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: it abuses the package installation process to execute arbitrary, hidden code on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscation, silent error suppression, and stealthy process creation (no window) are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is exclusively associated with malware.",
