The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file (likely a malicious payload) from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior is highly indicative of a dropper or loader malware, as it downloads and executes external code without user consent, uses obfuscation (base64 encoding), and runs in a hidden window to evade detection. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute automatically upon package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
