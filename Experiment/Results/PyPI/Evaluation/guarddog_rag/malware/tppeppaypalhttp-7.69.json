      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the setup process if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a common technique in malware to hide the true intent of the command and evade detection. The command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern, as it executes arbitrary code during package installation, potentially compromising the user's system. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification or consent, and the obfuscation of the payload are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
