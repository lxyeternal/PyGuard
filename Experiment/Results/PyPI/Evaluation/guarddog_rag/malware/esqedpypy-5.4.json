Specifically, it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious code is triggered during package installation, is obfuscated via base64 encoding, and downloads and executes a remote payload without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
