      "malicious_behavior": "This code overrides the setuptools install command (via the new_install class and cmdclass={'install': new_install}) to execute a _post_install function automatically upon package installation. The _post_install function collects sensitive information from the user's system, including the public IP address (via requests.get('https://api.ipify.org').text), the hostname (os.uname()[1]), and the current script path. It then encodes this information in base64 and sends it to an external, hardcoded domain (https://kotko.org) as a GET request, without any user notification or consent. This is a classic information-stealing and exfiltration pattern, strongly associated with supply chain attacks in Python packages. The behavior is hidden from normal package usage and only runs during installation, which is a hallmark of malicious packages. The use of base64 encoding for exfiltrated data, the lack of user interaction, and the targeting of a suspicious external domain further confirm the malicious intent.",
