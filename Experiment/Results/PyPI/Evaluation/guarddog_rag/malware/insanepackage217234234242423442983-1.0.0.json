      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It abuses the Python package installation process by defining a custom install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary, encrypted code during installation. Specifically, during installation on Windows systems, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and immediately executes a payload using Fernet decryption and exec. The payload is not visible in the source code, as it is encrypted and only revealed at runtime, which is a classic obfuscation and payload delivery technique used in supply chain attacks. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or awareness. The use of encrypted payloads, dynamic code execution, and modification of the installation process are all high-confidence indicators of malicious intent.",
