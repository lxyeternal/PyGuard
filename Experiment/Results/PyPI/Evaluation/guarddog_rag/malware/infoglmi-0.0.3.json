It downloads a binary executable ('node') from a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/misbebra-lol/actions-test/main/node) and writes it to /tmp/node. It also writes a configuration file to /tmp/config.json with settings for a cryptocurrency mining pool (144.76.245.112:22221, mode: 'nicehash'). The code then executes the downloaded binary with elevated permissions (chmod +x node && ./node --nicehash) via os.system, all without user consent or notification. These actions are performed automatically when the script runs, and the code is embedded in a setup.py file, meaning it will execute during package installation (a classic supply chain attack vector). The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code, especially a miner, during installation—is a hallmark of Python malware and supply chain attacks.",
