The payload uses __import__('builtins').exec(__import__('builtins').compile(__import__('base64').b64decode(...), '<string>', 'exec')) to decode and execute a base64-encoded string. The decoded payload imports tempfile, sys, os, writes a script to a temporary file, downloads and executes code from a suspicious external URL (https://zerotwo-best-waifu.online/778112985743251/wap/shalegay/injector0x9748), and attempts to execute it, suppressing all exceptions. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling remote code execution, data exfiltration, and system compromise. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and external network communication to a non-corporate domain are all strong indicators of malware.",
