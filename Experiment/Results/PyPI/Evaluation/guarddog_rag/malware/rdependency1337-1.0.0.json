      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware. Specifically: (1) It abuses the Python package installation process by defining a CustomInstall class that executes arbitrary code during installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (2) It collects sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, username) without user consent and exfiltrates this data to an external, suspicious domain (oastify.com), which is commonly used for payload delivery or data exfiltration in red teaming and malicious campaigns. (3) It executes a shell command to append a hardcoded SSH public key to the user's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file, creating a persistent backdoor for remote access without user knowledge or consent. (4) The code uses obfuscated variable names and lacks any legitimate package functionality, further indicating malicious intent. (5) There is no user interaction, logging, or error handling, and all actions are performed automatically during installation, maximizing stealth and impact. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
