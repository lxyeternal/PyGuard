      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen during the installation process (in setup.py). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and is executed only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common anti-analysis or persistence check. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory and then running it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell commands; (2) download and execution of remote code without user consent; (3) execution during package installation (setup.py); (4) use of hidden process creation to evade detection; (5) use of a suspicious or attacker-controlled domain. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script, and it is never observed in benign software.",
