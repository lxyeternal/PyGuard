      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple, critical indicators of malicious behavior. 1) It collects the victim's COMPUTERNAME environment variable and exfiltrates it to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation), which is a hallmark of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration. 2) It downloads a Windows executable (python-install.scr) from another suspicious domain (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), writes it to disk as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and immediately executes it via os.system('start '+filename). This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. 3) All of this is embedded in a custom setuptools install command (PostInstallCommand), ensuring the malicious actions are triggered automatically during package installation (a supply chain attack vector). 4) The code suppresses all exceptions, hiding errors and making detection harder. 5) There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or consent for these actions. 6) The package name ('elenium') is suspiciously similar to 'selenium', suggesting typosquatting. All these factors, especially the combination of data exfiltration, remote payload download/execution, and execution during install, are exclusively observed in malware and never in benign software.",
