      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior is a hallmark of malware: it downloads and executes potentially malicious binaries from the internet without user consent, during package installation (setup.py). The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. All these patterns—obfuscated command execution, remote payload download, execution during install, and error suppression—are strongly associated with supply chain attacks and malware in the Python ecosystem.",
