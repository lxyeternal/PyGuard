      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It programmatically locates and accesses sensitive files and directories associated with browsers (Chrome, Brave, Edge, Opera, etc.) and Discord, extracting stored credentials, cookies, and authentication tokens. It uses win32crypt and AES decryption to access protected data, a technique commonly used in credential-stealing malware. The code then writes this sensitive information to local files named with the current username, and subsequently exfiltrates these files to external servers via hardcoded Discord webhooks and Telegram bot APIs. The exfiltration is performed without user consent or notification. The code also deletes the evidence files after exfiltration, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The use of hardcoded, non-corporate endpoints, lack of legitimate user-facing functionality, and the combination of credential theft and automated exfiltration are all hallmarks of information-stealing malware.",
