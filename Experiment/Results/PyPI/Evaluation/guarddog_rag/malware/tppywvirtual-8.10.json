      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a highly obfuscated PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and run in hidden window mode (powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...), which is a classic malware technique for stealthy execution of arbitrary code, payload download, or further compromise. The encoded command appears to download and execute a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then invokes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation or setup, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
