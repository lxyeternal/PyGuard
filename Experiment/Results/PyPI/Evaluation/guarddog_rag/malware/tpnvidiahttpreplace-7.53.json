      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py context). Specifically, it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and attempts to run it, likely as a secondary payload. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
