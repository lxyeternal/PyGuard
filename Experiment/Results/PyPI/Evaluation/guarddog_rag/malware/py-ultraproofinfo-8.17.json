This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as the actual command is hidden from static analysis and can perform arbitrary actions on the victim's system. The command is triggered during the package setup process (i.e., when the package is installed), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of a suspicious URL (github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) in the encoded command suggests that it downloads and possibly executes a remote executable, further increasing the risk. The code also suppresses all exceptions, hiding any errors or detection attempts. These behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
