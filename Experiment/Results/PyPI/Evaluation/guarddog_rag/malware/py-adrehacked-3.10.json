      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it imports subprocess and os, checks for the absence of a file named 'tahg', and then executes a PowerShell command in hidden mode using an encoded (base64) payload. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic malware dropper technique, often used in supply chain attacks via Python packages. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW ensures the process runs stealthily, without user notification. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. The setup() call is legitimate, but the malicious payload is executed as a side effect during installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain malware.",
