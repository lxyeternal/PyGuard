      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded (base64) payload. The command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), and the use of '-WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flags is a classic indicator of stealthy, malicious activity. The encoded command downloads and/or executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. This behavior is executed automatically during package installation (setup.py), making it a supply chain attack vector. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate reason for this behavior in a package setup script. The code also suppresses all errors with a bare except, further hiding its actions.",
