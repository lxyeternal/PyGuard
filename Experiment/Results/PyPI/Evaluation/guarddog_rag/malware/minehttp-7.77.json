      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and executed with PowerShell's -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing potentially malicious payloads on Windows systems. The encoded command downloads and executes a file (Esquele.exe) from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware: it downloads and executes a remote binary without user consent, uses obfuscation to evade detection, and runs during package installation (setup.py), which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a package setup script.",
