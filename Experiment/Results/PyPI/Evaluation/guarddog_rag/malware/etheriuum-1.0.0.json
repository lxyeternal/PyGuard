It defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the presence of an encrypted payload, and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality further reinforce the malicious nature. The package name 'etheriuum' is also suspiciously similar to 'ethereum', suggesting typosquatting. This code matches multiple critical risk indicators: execution of decrypted code at install time, use of hardcoded cryptographic keys, obfuscation, and potential for arbitrary code execution and payload delivery.",
