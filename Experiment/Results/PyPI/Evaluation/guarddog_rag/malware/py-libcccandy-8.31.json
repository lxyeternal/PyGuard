      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed on the victim's machine without user consent or visibility. The command is triggered during package installation (in the setup.py context), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The base64 payload decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs them. This behavior enables remote code execution, potential persistence, and further compromise of the system. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, and the obfuscated payload are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
