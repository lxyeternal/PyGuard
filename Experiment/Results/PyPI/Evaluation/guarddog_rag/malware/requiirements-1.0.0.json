      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and exhibits multiple critical risk indicators associated with supply chain attacks and remote code execution. Specifically: (1) It overrides the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary code during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain malware. (2) The install hook imports 'requests' and 'fernet' dynamically and uses Fernet to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This is a classic obfuscation and payload delivery technique used to bypass static analysis and deliver secondary malware. (3) The payload is only executed on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), indicating targeted behavior. (4) The package name 'requiirements' is a typosquat of the legitimate 'requirements', a common tactic in malicious PyPI packages. (5) The code is obfuscated, with meaningless variable names and no legitimate installation logic. (6) The use of encrypted blobs and dynamic code execution (exec on decrypted data) is never seen in benign packages and is a strong indicator of malicious intent. (7) The package requires 'fernet' and 'requests' as dependencies, which are commonly used in malware for encryption and network communication. (8) There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate purpose for the code executed during installation.",
