      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and strongly malicious pattern: during package installation (in the setup.py context), it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg'. If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The command is base64-encoded, which is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the payload. Decoding the base64 reveals that the PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is triggered during installation, downloads and executes a remote payload, and does so without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All of these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
