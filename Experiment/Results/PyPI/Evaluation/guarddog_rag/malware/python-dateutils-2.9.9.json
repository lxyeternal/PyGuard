      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly obfuscated and exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior. It uses eval and compile to dynamically execute code that is base64-decoded at runtime, a classic technique for hiding and delivering malicious payloads. The variables 'magic', 'love', 'god', and 'destiny' contain large, encoded strings, which are concatenated and decoded to form executable code. The code also imports modules commonly used for system interaction and network communication (e.g., os, requests, subprocess, sys, platform), and it makes HTTP requests to suspicious, hardcoded URLs. There are clear signs of data exfiltration (e.g., sending IP address and system information to a remote server), and the code is structured to execute during installation or initialization, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and external communication without user consent are all strong indicators of malware.",
