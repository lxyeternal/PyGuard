It defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation without user consent. The use of obfuscated class names, a suspicious package name ('requiirments' - a common typo of 'requirements'), and the lack of any legitimate business logic further indicate malicious intent. The decrypted payload is not visible in the code, making it impossible to determine its full behavior statically, but the combination of dynamic decryption and execution is a critical risk and is never seen in benign software.",
