In its run() method, it collects the system's hostname and local IP address, then sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL using the discord.py and aiohttp libraries. This exfiltration of host-specific information to an external, non-corporate server occurs automatically and without user consent during installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious PyPI packages. The use of a Discord webhook for data exfiltration, the lack of user notification, and the execution of this logic in a setup script are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is not observed in benign software and is consistently associated with malware.",
