      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (esquelesquad.000webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquadesquadsquad.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then invokes it. This behavior is a hallmark of malware: it downloads and runs an untrusted executable from the internet without user consent, during package installation (setup.py context), and attempts to hide its activity (hidden window, encoded command, try/except suppression). The code is designed to run automatically when the package is installed, making it a supply chain attack vector. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
