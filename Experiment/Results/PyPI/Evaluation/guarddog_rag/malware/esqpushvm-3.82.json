      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the setup process of a Python package. Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and/or executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is triggered automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification, and is hidden from the user (WindowStyle Hidden, CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware, as it enables remote code execution and potential system compromise.",
