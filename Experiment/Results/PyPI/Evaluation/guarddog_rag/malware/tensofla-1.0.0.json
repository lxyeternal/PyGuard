      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly indicative of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack via a Python package. The setup.py script defines a custom install command class with an obfuscated, randomly generated name. During installation (specifically on Windows systems), it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' (from the cryptography library), then decrypts and immediately executes an encrypted payload using Fernet and exec. The encrypted payload is not visible in the source, making its intent and actions hidden from static analysis. This pattern—encrypted payload delivery, dynamic decryption and execution at install time, obfuscated class names, and lack of legitimate package functionality—is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages. There is no user interaction, consent, or transparency, and the code is designed to evade detection and analysis. The use of exec on decrypted data is a critical risk and is never seen in benign packages.",
