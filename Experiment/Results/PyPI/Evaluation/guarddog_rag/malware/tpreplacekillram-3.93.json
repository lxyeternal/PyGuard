      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed on the victim's machine without their knowledge. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution. The PowerShell command, once decoded, appears to download and execute further code from a suspicious external URL (github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe and WindowsCache.exe), which is a hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides the malicious activity. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks, as it is embedded in a setup script and will execute during package installation, potentially compromising any system that installs the package.",
