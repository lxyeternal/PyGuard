      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is provided as a long, base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is run with -WindowStyle Hidden and subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, ensuring no visible window appears, further increasing stealth. The encoded payload, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com), specifically a file named 'Esquele.exe', and attempts to run it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly seen in supply chain attacks via Python package setup scripts. The use of try/except to suppress errors and the lack of user notification or consent further confirm malicious intent.",
