It defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that, during package installation on Windows systems, dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden and obfuscated, only revealed and executed at install time, which can result in arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of encrypted payloads, dynamic imports, and execution during installation are all strong indicators of malware, as is the lack of any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python package malware.",
