      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and executed with PowerShell's -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution and payload delivery. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (the URL is obfuscated in the base64 string), likely without user consent or notification. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation or setup. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute remote code in this manner, and this pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples.",
