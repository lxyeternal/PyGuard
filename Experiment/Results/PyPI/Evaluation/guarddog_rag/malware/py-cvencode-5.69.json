The command is obfuscated and is executed only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a classic anti-analysis or persistence check. The PowerShell command is encoded, making its intent opaque, but this pattern is a hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand is a well-known technique for evading detection and running arbitrary or malicious code on Windows systems. This behavior is never observed in benign Python packages and is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or malware, especially as it is triggered during package installation without user consent or notification.",
