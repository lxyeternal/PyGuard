Specifically, it uses subprocess.Popen to run 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...', which is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The base64-encoded payload is not transparently visible, and the command is executed without user interaction, logging, or consent. The code also checks for the existence of a suspiciously named directory ('tahg'), which is a common tactic for evasion or persistence. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, especially in Python package setup scripts.",
