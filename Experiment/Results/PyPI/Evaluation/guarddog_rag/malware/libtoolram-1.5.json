      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell commands to be executed without user knowledge. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and attempts to run it, likely as a secondary payload. This behavior is highly indicative of a supply chain attack, as it is embedded in a setup script that would be triggered during package installation, enabling remote code execution on the victim's machine. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
