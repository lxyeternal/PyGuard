      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The command is obfuscated using PowerShell's -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for hiding the true intent of the payload and evading static analysis. The base64-encoded payload, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from an external, non-transparent URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and attempts to run it, likely as a secondary malicious payload. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery: it executes arbitrary code during package installation or setup, without user consent, and attempts to persist or further compromise the system. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner.",
