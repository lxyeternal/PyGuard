      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It abuses the Python package installation process by defining a custom install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary, hidden code during installation. Specifically, it imports Fernet and requests, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet's decrypt method and exec. The payload is not visible in the source code, indicating strong obfuscation and intent to hide its behavior. This pattern—encrypted payload delivery, dynamic code execution via exec, and execution during install—is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and Python malware. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute hidden, encrypted code at install time, especially without user consent or transparency. The use of non-descriptive names, lack of documentation, and suspicious metadata further reinforce the malicious nature.",
