Specifically, if the 'tahg' file or directory does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered during package installation, is obfuscated, downloads and executes a remote payload, and attempts to evade detection by hiding the process window and suppressing all exceptions. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is strongly associated with malware.",
