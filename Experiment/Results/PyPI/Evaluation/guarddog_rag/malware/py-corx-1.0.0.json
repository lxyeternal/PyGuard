It defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that, during package installation on Windows systems, dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python: it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, with the payload hidden and obfuscated via encryption. The use of hardcoded cryptographic keys, dynamic imports, and execution of decrypted code, all triggered automatically during installation, is strongly associated with malware and is never seen in benign packages. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior. The code is designed to evade static analysis and deliver a hidden payload, which could perform any malicious action (e.g., data exfiltration, backdoor installation, credential theft).",
