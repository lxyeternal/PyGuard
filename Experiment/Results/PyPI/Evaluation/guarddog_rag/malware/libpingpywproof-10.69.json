      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if not present, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using an encoded command. The encoded command is passed to PowerShell via the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing potentially malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is base64-encoded, making static analysis more difficult and hiding its true intent. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, especially in the context of a Python package setup script, as it enables remote code execution or payload delivery during installation (a classic supply chain attack vector). The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute hidden, obfuscated PowerShell commands without user consent.",
