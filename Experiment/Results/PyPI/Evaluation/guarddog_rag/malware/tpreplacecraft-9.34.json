      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command. The encoded command is passed to PowerShell using the '-EncodedCommand' flag and is run with '-WindowStyle Hidden', ensuring stealthy execution. This is a textbook technique for malware to download and execute further payloads, establish persistence, or exfiltrate data without user knowledge. The use of obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell commands, hidden execution, and the lack of any user interaction or notification are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the use of a non-standard directory name further support the assessment of maliciousness.",
