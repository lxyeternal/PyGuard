This behavior is executed automatically during the installation process, without user consent or notification, and serves no legitimate purpose in a package installation context. The use of a custom install hook for data exfiltration is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware. The code matches multiple high-confidence malicious patterns: exfiltration of host/user data, use of a suspicious external endpoint, and execution during package installation.",
