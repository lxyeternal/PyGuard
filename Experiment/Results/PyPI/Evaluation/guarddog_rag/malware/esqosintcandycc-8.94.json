The encoded command decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a classic malware dropper technique, commonly used in supply chain attacks via Python packages. The use of subprocess.Popen with PowerShell in hidden mode, encoded commands, and silent error suppression (broad try/except) are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The malicious behavior is triggered during package installation, not normal usage, which is a hallmark of supply chain malware.",
