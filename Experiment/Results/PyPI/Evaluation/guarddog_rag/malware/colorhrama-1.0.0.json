It overrides the setuptools install command (via cmdclass in setup.py) to execute arbitrary, encrypted code during package installation, but only on Windows systems. Specifically, it imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes a payload using exec(Fernet(...).decrypt(...)). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden (encrypted), only runs on install (not during normal package use), and is executed without user knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscation (encryption), dynamic code execution (exec), and the presence of suspicious, non-descriptive metadata (author, description, etc.) are all strong indicators of malware. The package name 'colorhrama' is also a likely typosquat of 'colorama', a popular legitimate package, further supporting the malicious intent.",
