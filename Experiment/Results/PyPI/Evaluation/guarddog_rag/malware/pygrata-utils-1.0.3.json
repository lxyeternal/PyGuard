It collects highly sensitive information from the host system, including AWS IAM credentials (via the EC2 metadata endpoint), AWS CLI credentials, SSH keys, environment variables (including .env files), hostname, username, current working directory, and IP addresses. It then exfiltrates this data to hardcoded, suspicious external servers (graph.pygrata.com and graphs.pygrata.com) using HTTP POST requests. The code also encodes the username and sends it via DNS queries to a suspicious domain (isuser.api.pygrata.com). All of these actions are performed without user consent, logging, or legitimate business logic. The code is embedded in a setup.py file, meaning it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The combination of credential theft, environment reconnaissance, and automated exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure is a classic pattern of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages.",
