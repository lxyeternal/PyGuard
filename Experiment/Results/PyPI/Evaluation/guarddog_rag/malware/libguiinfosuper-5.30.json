      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the setup process of a Python package. Specifically, if the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the user's system during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and external payload delivery is strongly associated with malware and is never observed in benign software. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its actions.",
