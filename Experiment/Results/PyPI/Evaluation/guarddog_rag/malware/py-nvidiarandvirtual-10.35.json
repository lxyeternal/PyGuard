      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded payload. The command is base64-encoded and is run with -WindowStyle Hidden, which is a classic technique for stealthy execution of malicious payloads on Windows systems. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code download and execution, obfuscation via base64 encoding, use of PowerShell in hidden mode, and execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector). The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script. This is a textbook example of a malicious supply chain attack in a Python package.",
