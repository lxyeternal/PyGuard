The base64-encoded PowerShell command decodes to a script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in the setup script, so it will execute automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the obfuscated payload delivery, and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality are all strong indicators of malware. This pattern is observed exclusively in malicious samples and is never seen in benign software.",
