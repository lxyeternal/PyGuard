Specifically, it checks if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden from static analysis, is executed without user consent, and is triggered during package installation. The use of subprocess.Popen with a hidden window and encoded PowerShell command is a strong indicator of malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution, remote payload delivery, and potential system compromise. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated payload delivery, hidden process execution, execution during install, and lack of user notification or consent.",
