The CustomInstall class simply calls the parent install.run() method without any additional logic. There are no suspicious imports, no code execution, no network communication, no file system manipulation, no obfuscation, and no evidence of data exfiltration or privilege escalation. The install_requires list includes some packages (requests, pyautogui, pycryptodome, pywin32-ctypes, psutil) that are sometimes used in malware, but their presence alone is not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. The script does not perform any actions during installation except for the standard package installation process. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
