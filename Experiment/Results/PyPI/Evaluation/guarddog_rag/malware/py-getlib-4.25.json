This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed without user consent or visibility. The command is triggered during the setup process (likely during package installation), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The encoded command appears to download or interact with a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com) and execute a file (Esquele.exe), which is highly indicative of malware delivery and remote code execution. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
