      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a highly obfuscated PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and run in hidden window mode, which is a classic technique for stealthy execution of secondary payloads or remote code. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and then running it. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence malware indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell commands; (2) downloading and executing a remote binary without user consent; (3) use of try/except to suppress errors and evade detection; (4) execution during package setup, a common supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a setup script, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
