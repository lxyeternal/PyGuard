If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The command is base64-encoded, which is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the payload. Decoding the base64 reveals that the PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs them. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is triggered during installation, downloads and executes remote payloads, and uses obfuscation and exception suppression to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples.",
