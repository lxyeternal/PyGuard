The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated and is executed without user interaction or consent, and only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware. The use of PowerShell in hidden mode with an encoded command is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script, and it is not related to the stated package functionality. This matches multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated payload delivery, hidden process execution, lack of user consent, and execution during install/setup (supply chain attack vector).",
