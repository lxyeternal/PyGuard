Specifically, it contains a long, obfuscated string and a numeric key, which are XORed together to reconstruct a hidden Python payload. This payload is then executed using eval(compile(..., 'exec')), allowing arbitrary code execution on the user's system at install time. The obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and execution during installation are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its behavior. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute hidden, obfuscated code during installation.",
