It defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that, during package installation on Windows systems, dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated package metadata (e.g., typosquatted name 'requeits', random author and description), dynamic imports, and encrypted payloads further indicate an attempt to evade detection and hide malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior. This matches multiple critical risk indicators, including execution of decrypted code at install time, use of hardcoded cryptographic keys, and obfuscation via encryption.",
