It then encodes this information as URL parameters and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external, hardcoded, non-corporate URL (http://pt.traktrain.com/RCE_PYTHON). This is a classic pattern of automated data exfiltration and system fingerprinting, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in the context of a setup script that would be executed during package installation (supply chain attack vector). There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or documentation justifying this behavior. The combination of system reconnaissance and exfiltration to an external server is strongly associated with malware and is not observed in benign software.",
