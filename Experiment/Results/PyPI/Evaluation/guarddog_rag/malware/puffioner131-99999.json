      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It abuses the Python package installation process by defining custom install and develop commands (PostInstallCommand and PostDevelopCommand) that automatically collect all environment variables from the victim's system and exfiltrate them via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (http://eewtrzyimp165no1u4kqfhv0nrtih95y.oastify.com) without user consent or notification. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, commonly observed in malicious PyPI packages. The exfiltrated environment variables may contain sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, tokens, and other secrets. There is no legitimate reason for a package to perform this action during installation or development, and this behavior is a strong indicator of credential-stealing malware.",
