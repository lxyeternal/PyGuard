This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed without user consent or visibility. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and/or executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), and writes it to a file in the user's home directory. This behavior is strongly associated with malware, especially supply chain attacks in Python packages, as it enables remote code execution during package installation. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute hidden, obfuscated PowerShell commands that download and run remote code.",
