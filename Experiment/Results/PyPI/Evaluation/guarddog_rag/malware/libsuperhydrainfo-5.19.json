The base64-encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in the setup script, so it will execute automatically when the package is installed (e.g., via pip). The use of try/except to suppress errors, the obfuscated and hidden execution, and the lack of user notification or consent are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code matches multiple high-confidence malware patterns, including remote payload download and execution, obfuscation, and execution during installation.",
