      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py script). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns: executing obfuscated commands, downloading and running remote executables, hiding execution from the user, and embedding this logic in a setup script to trigger during package installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks). The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
