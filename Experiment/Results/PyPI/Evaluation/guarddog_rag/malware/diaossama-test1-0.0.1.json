It then concatenates this information, encodes it in base64, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://162.62.15.24/v/%s). This is a classic data exfiltration pattern, commonly seen in malicious Python packages, especially those targeting supply chain attacks via PyPI. The code is executed at import time, not as part of any legitimate application logic, and is embedded in what appears to be a setup or installation script, which is a hallmark of supply chain malware. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate reason for this data collection and exfiltration. The use of a raw IP address, rather than a domain, further increases suspicion, as this is a common tactic to evade domain-based security monitoring.",
