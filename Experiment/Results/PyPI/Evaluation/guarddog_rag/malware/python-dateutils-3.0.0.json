      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation, including base64 and hex encoding, to hide its true functionality. The code reconstructs and executes additional code at runtime using eval and compile on decoded payloads, a classic malware technique for evading static analysis. The variables 'magic', 'love', 'god', and 'destiny' contain large, encoded payloads that are dynamically decoded and executed. The code also imports modules commonly used for system interaction and network communication (e.g., os, requests, subprocess, sys, platform), and it contains hardcoded URLs and webhook endpoints, which are typical for data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication. The presence of code that collects system and user information and sends it to an external server, combined with the execution of dynamically decoded code, is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote access trojans (RATs). There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation to justify these actions. All these factors, especially the dynamic code execution and obfuscated payloads, confirm that this code is malicious.",
