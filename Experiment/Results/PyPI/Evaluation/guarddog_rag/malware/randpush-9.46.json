Specifically, it checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and writes it to a location in the user's home directory (WindowsCache.exe). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: executing arbitrary, obfuscated code during package installation, downloading and running a remote executable, and doing so without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious behavior. All these characteristics match high-confidence indicators of malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
