Specifically, on Windows systems, it imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and immediately executes an encrypted payload using exec(Fernet(...).decrypt(...)). The payload is not visible in the source, is encrypted with a hardcoded Fernet key, and is only decrypted and executed at install time, making static analysis difficult and enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never seen in benign software. The use of obfuscated metadata, suspicious author information, and the embedding of this logic in a setup script further confirm malicious intent.",
