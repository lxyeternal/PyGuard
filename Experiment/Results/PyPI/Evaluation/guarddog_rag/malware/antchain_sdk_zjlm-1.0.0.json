It then exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to an external, hardcoded, non-corporate domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io), which is commonly used for out-of-band data collection and is not associated with any legitimate business logic. This behavior is executed automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification, and is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and dependency confusion malware. The use of a custom install hook to perform data exfiltration is a critical risk and is observed exclusively in malicious samples.",
