      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded (base64) payload. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known malware technique to evade static analysis and deliver further payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a file (Esquele.exe) from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then invokes it. This behavior is highly indicative of a supply chain attack, as it runs during package installation (setup.py), and is consistent with known malware delivery and execution patterns. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
