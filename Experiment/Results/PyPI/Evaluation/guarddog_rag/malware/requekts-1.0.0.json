      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It abuses the Python package installation process by defining a custom install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary, encrypted code during installation. Specifically, on Windows systems, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and immediately executes a Fernet-encrypted payload using exec. The payload is not visible in the source code, making its intent and actions completely opaque to the user or reviewer. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, commonly used in malicious PyPI packages to deliver and execute hidden malware on victim systems. The use of strong encryption (Fernet), dynamic code execution (exec), and the lack of any legitimate package functionality are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic for this behavior. The package name ('requekts') is also a typosquat of the popular 'requests' library, further supporting the conclusion that this is a malicious package designed to trick users.",
