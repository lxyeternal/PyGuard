      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is provided as a long, base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The decoded command downloads and/or executes a remote payload from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code download and execution, obfuscation via base64 encoding, use of PowerShell in hidden mode, and execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate justification for this behavior in a setup script. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern seen in malicious PyPI packages.",
