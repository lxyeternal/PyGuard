Specifically, if the 'tahg' path does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as a hidden executable in the user's temp directory, then runs it. This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, and the obfuscated payload all strongly indicate malicious intent.",
