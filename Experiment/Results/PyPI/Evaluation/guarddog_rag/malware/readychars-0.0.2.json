The decoded payload performs the following actions: (1) downloads and executes code from external sources (specifically from hardcoded IP addresses such as 193.42.33.24), (2) writes files to disk, (3) attempts to execute downloaded payloads as processes, and (4) uses try/except blocks to suppress errors and evade detection. The use of dynamic imports, obfuscated code, and immediate execution of remote content is a hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate business logic for these actions. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware and is a critical risk for remote code execution and system compromise.",
