The encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe', then runs it and deletes it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: it abuses the setup/install process to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell, hidden window execution, and silent error suppression are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code is not related to any legitimate installation logic and is designed to evade detection and persist on the system.",
