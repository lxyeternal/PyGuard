The command uses '-EncodedCommand' to obfuscate its true intent, which is a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior enables remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential system compromise without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides malicious activity. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
