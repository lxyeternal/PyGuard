The setup.py script executes arbitrary Python code via subprocess.Popen during installation, specifically importing modules from a dependency ('secrevtwo') in a way that is not standard for benign setup scripts. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors and the lack of user notification or documentation further increase suspicion. The pattern of executing code during installation, especially from a dependency that could be malicious or typosquatted, is a critical risk and is strongly associated with malware. This technique allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the user's system as soon as the package is installed, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further payload delivery. The package and module names ('secrevtwo', 'dist_util') are also suspicious and do not correspond to any well-known, reputable libraries.",
