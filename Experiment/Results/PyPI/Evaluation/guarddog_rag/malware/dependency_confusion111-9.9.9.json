During installation (via pip install or python setup.py install/develop/egg_info), it collects sensitive information from the victim's machine, including the hostname, current user, and current working directory. It then encodes this data as JSON, hex-encodes it, splits it into chunks, and exfiltrates it covertly via DNS queries to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled domain (uchpuchmak.lol). The use of raw socket DNS requests for exfiltration is a classic stealth technique to bypass standard HTTP monitoring. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate reason for this data collection and exfiltration. The code is embedded in the setup.py install hooks, ensuring it runs automatically on package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The package name ('dependency_confusion111') and the description claiming 'research' are common social engineering tactics used to disguise malicious intent.",
