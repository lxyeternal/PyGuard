The only flagged line is a hardcoded URL ('hhttp://spacestudio-orbit-propagation.exoops.37.59.31.223.sslip.io') in the get_host_settings method. While the domain uses an IP-based subdomain and a dynamic DNS service (sslip.io), there is no evidence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or any other malicious behavior. The URL is statically defined and only used for API endpoint configuration, which is standard in SDKs. There are no suspicious imports, no shell command execution, no file or credential access, and no dynamic code loading. The code is well-documented, transparent, and consistent with benign SDK configuration logic. The only issue is the typo in the URL scheme ('hhttp'), which would actually prevent network communication unless corrected. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
