      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded (base64) payload. The command is obfuscated and is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and static analysis. The encoded command downloads and/or executes a file from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware: remote code download and execution, obfuscation via base64 encoding, use of hidden PowerShell, and execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector). The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
