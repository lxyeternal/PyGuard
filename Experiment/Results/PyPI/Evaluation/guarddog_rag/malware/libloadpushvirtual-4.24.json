      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the package installation process (in the setup.py script). Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered during installation, is obfuscated, downloads and executes a remote payload, and attempts to evade detection by hiding the PowerShell window. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to avoid detection or interruption. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
