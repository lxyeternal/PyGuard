      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py script). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and attempts to run it, as well as another executable (WindowsCache.exe) from the user's home directory. This behavior is highly indicative of a supply chain attack, as it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
