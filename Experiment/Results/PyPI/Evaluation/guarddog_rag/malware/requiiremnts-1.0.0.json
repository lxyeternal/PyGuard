      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It subclasses setuptools' install command to execute arbitrary code during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. Specifically, the custom install class imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then uses Fernet decryption with a hardcoded key to decrypt an opaque, encrypted payload, which is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern (decryption followed by exec in an install hook) is never observed in benign software and is a strong indicator of malware. The use of obfuscated class names, lack of legitimate functionality, and execution of hidden code during installation further confirm malicious intent. The code is designed to run only on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), which is a common targeting technique. There is no user notification, validation, or legitimate reason for this behavior.",
