      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and exhibits multiple critical risk indicators associated with supply chain attacks and Python malware. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command that executes arbitrary, encrypted code during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (2) The payload is encrypted with Fernet and immediately decrypted and executed via exec(), which is a classic obfuscation and payload delivery technique used exclusively in malware. (3) The code imports 'requests' and 'fernet' dynamically within the install hook, further hiding its intent and increasing the risk of credential theft, data exfiltration, or remote code execution. (4) The package metadata (name, author, email) is nonsensical, which is typical of typosquatted or malicious packages. (5) The code is triggered automatically on Windows systems during installation, without user consent or notification, and there is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality. (6) The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution is never observed in benign Python packages, especially in setup scripts. All these factors, combined with the absence of any legitimate purpose, confirm this is a malicious package designed to compromise user systems.",
