      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if not present, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and obfuscated, and is executed in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), which is a classic stealth technique. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgny.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in a setup script, runs automatically on install, downloads and executes a remote binary, and does so without user interaction or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the behavior. All these characteristics are exclusively observed in malware and are never present in benign software.",
