      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the setup process if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a common technique in malware to hide the true intent of the command and evade detection. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, as it runs automatically during package installation (via setup.py), enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise without user consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and ensure execution. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
