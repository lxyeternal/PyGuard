During installation, it automatically downloads a Windows executable (CBLines.exe) from a remote URL (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe) using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest, saves it to the current working directory, and then immediately executes it using PowerShell's Start-Process. This is done without any user interaction, consent, or notification. The use of shell=True in subprocess calls, the download and execution of a remote binary, and the execution of this logic during package installation are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a classic technique for delivering and executing malicious payloads on victim systems.",
