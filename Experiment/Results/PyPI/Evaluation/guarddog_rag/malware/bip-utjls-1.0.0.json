Specifically, on Windows systems, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then uses Fernet to decrypt an encrypted payload and immediately executes the result with exec(). The encrypted payload is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true behavior from static analysis. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks: arbitrary, hidden code execution during install, use of obfuscation/encryption, and no user notification or legitimate install logic. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a critical risk, as it allows for arbitrary code execution, which could include data exfiltration, credential theft, or further malware installation. The package metadata (author, description, etc.) is also suspicious and non-descriptive, further supporting the malicious assessment.",
