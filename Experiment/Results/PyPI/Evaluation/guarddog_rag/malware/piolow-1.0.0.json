      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It abuses the Python package installation process by defining a custom install command (GruppeInstall) that executes arbitrary, encrypted code during installation. Specifically, it uses Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt a payload at install time and immediately executes it via exec. The encrypted payload is not visible in the source, making its intent and actions opaque and preventing static analysis. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, commonly seen in malicious PyPI packages. The use of obfuscated author information, meaningless descriptions, and the presence of both 'requests' and 'fernet' as dependencies further support the conclusion that this package is designed to deliver and execute a hidden, potentially harmful payload on the victim's system without their knowledge or consent. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is a critical risk indicator.",
