After performing standard setuptools setup, it imports urllib, os, and subprocess, then downloads data from a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://frvezdffvv.pythonanywhere.com/getpackage). The downloaded data is written as a base64-encoded payload to a Python file in the user's AppData\\Roaming directory, a location commonly abused for persistence and stealth. The code then immediately executes this file in a hidden subprocess (using subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW), running arbitrary code received from the remote server. This pattern—downloading code from an untrusted source, writing it to disk, decoding and executing it, and hiding the process window—is a hallmark of Python malware and supply chain attacks. There is no user interaction, validation, or legitimate business logic for this behavior, and the use of base64 encoding, dynamic code execution, and suspicious file paths further elevate the risk. This code is highly likely to be malicious.",
