      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (i.e., in the setup.py script). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command downloads an executable ('Esquele.exe') from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. It then attempts to execute this file. This behavior is highly indicative of a supply chain attack, as it leverages the package installation process to deliver and execute a remote payload without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
