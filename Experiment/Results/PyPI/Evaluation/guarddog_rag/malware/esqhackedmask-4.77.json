Specifically, if the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command in hidden mode using the '-EncodedCommand' flag. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks via Python package installation scripts. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user interaction or notification, and the obfuscation of the payload further confirm malicious intent. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python-based malware.",
