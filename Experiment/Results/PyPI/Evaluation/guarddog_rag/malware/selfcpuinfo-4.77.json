If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic malware technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious commands on the victim's system without their knowledge. The use of a hidden window, encoded command, and the context of execution during package installation (setup.py) are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads and/or executes further payloads from a remote server (the encoded string contains a suspicious URL: 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0'), which is a hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute such a command, especially in a hidden and obfuscated manner.",
