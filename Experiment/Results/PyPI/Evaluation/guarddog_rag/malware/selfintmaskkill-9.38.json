      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious payloads on Windows systems. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com), specifically a file named 'Esquele.exe', and saves it to a hidden location. This behavior is a classic indicator of malware: it downloads and executes a remote payload without user consent, uses obfuscation to evade detection, and runs during package installation (setup.py), which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these characteristics match critical risk indicators for Python malware and supply chain attacks.",
