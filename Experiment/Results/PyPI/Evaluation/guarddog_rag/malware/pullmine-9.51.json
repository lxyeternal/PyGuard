The encoded PowerShell command is passed to 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...', which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The use of subprocess.Popen with a hidden window, the obfuscated payload, and the lack of user interaction or notification are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware, especially in supply chain attacks via Python packages, and is never seen in benign software. The code is designed to execute arbitrary or attacker-controlled code on the victim's system without their knowledge, which can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment.",
