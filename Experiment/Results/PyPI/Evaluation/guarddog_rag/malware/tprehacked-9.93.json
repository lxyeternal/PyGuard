      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process of a Python package (via setup.py). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and/or executes content from a suspicious external URL (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and attempts to run it, likely as a secondary payload. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, enabling remote code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, and the obfuscation of the payload further confirm malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware.",
