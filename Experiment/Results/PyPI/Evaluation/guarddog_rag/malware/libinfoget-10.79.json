      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern: during installation (in the setup.py script), it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg'. If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious PowerShell commands on Windows systems. The encoded command downloads and/or executes content from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0), saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', and then invokes it. This behavior is strongly associated with malware: it enables remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential system compromise without user consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute automatically upon package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem.",
