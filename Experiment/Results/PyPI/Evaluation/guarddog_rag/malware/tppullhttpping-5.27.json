      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory ('tahg'), and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious payloads on Windows systems. The encoded payload, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it, all without user consent or notification. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks via Python packages, as it enables remote code execution and potential system compromise during package installation or import. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a package setup script.",
