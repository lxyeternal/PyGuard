      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command (base64-encoded PowerShell). The command is executed with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand', which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads on Windows systems. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks via Python package setup scripts. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner, and this behavior is exclusively observed in malware.",
