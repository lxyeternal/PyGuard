The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory. It then attempts to execute this file. This behavior is highly indicative of malware: it uses obfuscation (base64 encoding), stealth execution (hidden window), remote payload download and execution, and is triggered during package installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks). The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. All these patterns are exclusively observed in malware and are never present in benign software.",
