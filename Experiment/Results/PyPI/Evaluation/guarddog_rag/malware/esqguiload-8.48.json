The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory. It then attempts to execute this file. This behavior is highly characteristic of malware: it uses obfuscation (base64 encoding), stealth execution (hidden window), remote payload retrieval, and execution without user consent, all triggered during package installation. The use of a try/except block to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. These patterns are exclusively observed in malware and are never present in benign software.",
