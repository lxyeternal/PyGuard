It defines a custom setuptools install command (Updater) that, during package installation, constructs an obfuscated URL (using string concatenation and misleading variable names) pointing to a remote server (filebin.net/95iifmxlei9dcctd/qrcodegen.py). It then downloads a Python file from this remote location using the requests library and writes it as 'qrcodegen.py' in the current directory. Immediately after, it executes this downloaded file using subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, 'qrcodegen.py']). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks: it enables arbitrary code execution on the installer's machine, with the payload fully controlled by the remote server. The obfuscation of the URL, the lack of user notification or consent, the execution of remote code during installation, and the use of a non-official, non-corporate domain are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is a critical risk for remote code execution and system compromise.",
