The encoded command (base64) is passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of arbitrary or obfuscated payloads. The command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgny.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in a setup script, runs automatically on install, and attempts to download and execute a remote payload without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the behavior. All these patterns are exclusively observed in malware and are never justified in benign software.",
