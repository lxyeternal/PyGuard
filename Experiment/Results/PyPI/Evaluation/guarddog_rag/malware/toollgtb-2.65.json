      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py script). Specifically, if the 'tahg' file or directory does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a classic technique for executing obfuscated or malicious payloads on Windows systems. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute remote binaries in this manner.",
