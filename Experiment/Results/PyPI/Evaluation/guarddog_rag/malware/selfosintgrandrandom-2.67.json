      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded PowerShell command decodes to a script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and writes it to a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is embedded in a setup script, so it will execute automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All of these behaviors—obfuscated command execution, remote payload download, execution during installation, and error suppression—are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
