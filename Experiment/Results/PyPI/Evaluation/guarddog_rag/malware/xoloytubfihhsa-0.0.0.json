      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a classic example of credential-stealing malware, specifically targeting Roblox users. It uses the browser_cookie3 library to extract the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie from multiple browsers (Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome) without user consent. This cookie is a sensitive authentication token that allows full access to the victim's Roblox account. The code then collects additional sensitive information, including the victim's public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org/), Roblox account details (username, Robux balance, account creation date, friends, RAP, premium status), and constructs links to the victim's profile and Rolimons page. All of this information, including the stolen cookie, is exfiltrated via a hardcoded Discord webhook (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1038471028231385098/Ahvffm0o38deC_39_s730s6Hd9NO_DkHRgozmoEbHfjB8o699D1dm4Zvg3VQlbOHkHVZ), which is controlled by the attacker. The code also checks if the cookie is valid and, if not, still exfiltrates the expired cookie. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate purpose for these actions. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware: credential theft, data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled endpoint, lack of user interaction, and targeting of sensitive browser data.",
