It connects to a remote host (6.tcp.eu.ngrok.io) and port (19048) using a TCP socket, then redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to this socket. It spawns an interactive bash shell, allowing the remote server to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. This pattern is a textbook example of a remote access trojan (RAT) and is never observed in benign software. There is no user interaction, authentication, or legitimate purpose for this behavior. The use of a hardcoded external domain, immediate shell spawning, and redirection of I/O to a remote server are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
