This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python packages. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding and is executed only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of subprocess.Popen with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution without user consent or notification. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of package installation scripts.",
