      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen during the package setup process. The command is obfuscated and runs in hidden mode (powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...), which is a classic technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. The encoded command appears to download and execute a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior is highly indicative of a supply chain attack, as it enables remote code execution on the victim's system without user consent, and is never observed in benign software. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks in Python packages.",
