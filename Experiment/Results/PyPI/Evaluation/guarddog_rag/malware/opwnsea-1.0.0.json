      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution, combined with the lack of any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, further supports the assessment of malicious intent. The package metadata (name, author, description) is also suspicious and non-descriptive, which is common in malicious or typosquatted packages. The code is specifically targeted at Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), which is a common tactic for targeting a large user base. The use of Fernet decryption in install scripts is never seen in benign software and is a strong indicator of malware.",
