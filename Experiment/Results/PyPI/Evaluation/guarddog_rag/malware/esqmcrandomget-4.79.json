      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and encoded, which is a classic technique for hiding malicious intent and evading static analysis. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs them. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell commands; (2) downloading and executing remote payloads without user consent; (3) use of hidden windows to evade user detection; (4) execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector); (5) lack of legitimate business logic for such actions in a setup script. The code is designed to compromise the system stealthily and is strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
