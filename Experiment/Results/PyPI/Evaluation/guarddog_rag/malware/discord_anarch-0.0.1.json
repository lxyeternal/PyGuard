      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. The most critical is the init_nuker class method, which downloads a remote Python file (main.py) from a Discord CDN URL directly into the Windows Startup folder (C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup), and then immediately executes it in a new thread. This is a classic persistence mechanism used by malware to ensure code is run on system startup, and the downloaded code is executed without any validation, user interaction, or integrity checking. The code also provides methods to ban, kick, and delete Discord users and channels via direct HTTP requests, which can be used for mass disruption ('nuking') of Discord servers. The use of hardcoded Discord API endpoints, lack of user consent, and the ability to execute arbitrary code from a remote source all point to malicious intent. The combination of remote payload download, persistence, and execution is a textbook malware pattern, and is never observed in benign software.",
