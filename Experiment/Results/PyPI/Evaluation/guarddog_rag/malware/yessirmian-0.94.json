Specifically, in the CustomInstallCommand.run() method, it collects the victim's hostname and local IP address using socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname(), then exfiltrates this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL via the discord.Webhook API. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code runs automatically during installation (without user consent or notification), collects system-identifying information, and sends it to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint. There is no legitimate reason for a package install script to perform this kind of data exfiltration, and this pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of malicious PyPI packages.",
