The PowerShell command is encoded and executed with '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a classic technique for stealthy execution. The encoded command downloads and/or executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery: it downloads and runs an external executable without user consent, uses obfuscation to evade detection, and attempts to hide its execution. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples.",
