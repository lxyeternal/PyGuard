      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and exhibits multiple critical risk indicators associated with supply chain attacks and remote code execution. Specifically: (1) The setup.py script overrides the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary code during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain malware. (2) The custom install class (with an obfuscated name) imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' only if the OS is Windows, then uses Fernet to decrypt an encrypted payload and immediately executes it with exec(). (3) The encrypted payload is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the code from static analysis and security tools. (4) There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate installation logic; the install hook is abused solely for payload execution. (5) The package name 'tensogflow' is a typosquat of 'tensorflow', a common malware distribution tactic. (6) The code structure, variable naming, and lack of documentation are all consistent with malicious intent. (7) The use of exec() on decrypted data is a critical risk, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. (8) The inclusion of 'requests' as a dependency suggests possible network communication, data exfiltration, or further payload retrieval. All these behaviors are exclusively observed in malware samples and never in benign software.",
