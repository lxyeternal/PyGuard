      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if not present, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using an encoded command. The encoded command (base64) is passed to PowerShell with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of arbitrary or malicious payloads. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: it executes a remote payload during package installation, without user consent or notification, and attempts to evade detection by running in a hidden window and suppressing errors. The use of try/except to silently ignore errors further increases the stealthiness. All these behaviors are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never justified in benign software, especially in a setup script.",
