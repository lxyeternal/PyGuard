      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and executed with PowerShell's -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing potentially harmful payloads on Windows systems. The encoded command appears to download and/or execute a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), and saves or runs a file named 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code download and execution, use of obfuscation, lack of user consent, and execution during package setup (a common supply chain attack vector). The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a package setup script, and it is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks.",
