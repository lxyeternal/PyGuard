It defines custom setuptools install and develop commands (PostInstallCommand and PostDevelopCommand) that execute during package installation or development setup. In both cases, the overridden run() methods make HTTP GET requests to the hardcoded, suspicious domain 'http://poiqwe.info/install_post' and 'http://poiqwe.info/install_post_dev' without user consent, notification, or error handling. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered automatically during installation, enabling exfiltration of environment or host information, or acting as a beacon to a command-and-control (C2) server. The domain is not associated with any legitimate service, and there is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this network communication. The use of this pattern is strongly associated with malware, as it enables data exfiltration, tracking, or further payload delivery, and is never observed in benign open-source packages.",
