      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory ('tahg'), and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command. The encoded command (base64) is passed to PowerShell with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a classic malware technique for stealthy execution. Decoding the base64 reveals that the command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external domain (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is placed in a setup script, so it will run automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, and there are no legitimate reasons for such actions in a package setup script.",
