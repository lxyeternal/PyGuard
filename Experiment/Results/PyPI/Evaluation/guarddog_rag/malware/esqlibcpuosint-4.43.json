The command is only executed if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common anti-analysis or persistence technique. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote payload from an external, suspicious domain (esquelesquad.000webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquad.exe) and attempts to run it on the victim's machine. This pattern—downloading and executing a remote executable via a hidden process during package installation—is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and Python malware. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote code retrieval, all triggered automatically on install, matches multiple high-confidence malware indicators and is never seen in benign software.",
