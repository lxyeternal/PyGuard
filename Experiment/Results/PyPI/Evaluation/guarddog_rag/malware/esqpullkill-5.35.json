      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded (base64) payload. This is a classic malware technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code is triggered automatically during the package setup process (i.e., when the package is installed or built), which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the lack of any legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script further confirm the malicious nature. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and never in benign software.",
