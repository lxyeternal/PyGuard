The command is base64-encoded, which is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the payload. Decoding the base64 string reveals that it downloads and executes a file from a remote, non-trusted domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is embedded in a setup script to achieve remote code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are exclusively associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
