      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' argument. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code download and execution, use of obfuscated/encoded payloads, execution during package setup (supply chain attack vector), and lack of user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. This pattern is never observed in benign code and is a hallmark of Python-based malware, especially in supply chain attacks.",
