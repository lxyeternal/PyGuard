Specifically, it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command in hidden mode using an encoded payload. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious payload is triggered during package installation, without user interaction or consent, and the use of an encoded PowerShell command is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. The code is wrapped in a broad try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. These behaviors are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign software. The use of subprocess.Popen with a hidden window, encoded command, and no user notification is a critical risk indicator.",
