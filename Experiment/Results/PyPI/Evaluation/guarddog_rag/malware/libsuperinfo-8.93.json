Specifically, it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command. The decoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and writes it to a location in the user's home directory, then executes it. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign software. The use of obfuscated PowerShell, hidden process creation, and remote payload retrieval and execution during package installation is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malware.",
