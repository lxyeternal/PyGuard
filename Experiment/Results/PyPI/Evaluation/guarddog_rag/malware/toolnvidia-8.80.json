      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is provided as a long, base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a classic malware technique for obfuscating and delivering payloads. This command is executed with no user interaction, logging, or consent, and is run in a hidden window (WindowStyle Hidden, CREATE_NO_WINDOW), further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The encoded payload, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com), which is a hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The use of try/except to suppress errors and the placement of this logic in a setup script (commonly executed during package installation) are also strong indicators of a supply chain attack. All these behaviors are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign code.",
