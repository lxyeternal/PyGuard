The most egregious behavior is in the custom install command (TotallyInnocentClass), which executes a large, base64-encoded payload during package installation. Decoding this payload reveals that it performs the following actions: (1) collects system information (platform/system type), (2) renames and executes files, (3) downloads and executes additional code from remote servers, and (4) exfiltrates data to external, suspicious URLs (including 'grabify.link', a known IP logger and tracking service). The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic code execution (exec), and network communication to untrusted domains, all triggered during installation, are hallmarks of Python supply chain malware. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute such code during installation, especially without user consent or documentation. This is a textbook example of a malicious PyPI package designed to compromise user systems.",
