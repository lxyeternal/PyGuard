      "malicious_behavior": "The code is highly obfuscated and uses several classic malware techniques. It prints 'tkinter' as a decoy, then immediately executes a base64-decoded payload using builtins.exec and builtins.compile. The decoded payload performs the following actions: (1) creates a temporary file, (2) downloads code from a hardcoded external IP address (http://20.226.18.203/grab/ry2K1CIVRSFa59vT and http://20.226.18.203/clip), (3) writes the downloaded content to the temporary file, (4) attempts to execute the downloaded file as a Windows executable (renaming it to w.exe), and (5) deletes the temporary file after execution. This is a classic pattern for a dropper/downloader: it fetches and executes remote code, which is a critical risk and a hallmark of malware. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded external IPs, and lack of user interaction or consent further confirm the malicious intent.",
