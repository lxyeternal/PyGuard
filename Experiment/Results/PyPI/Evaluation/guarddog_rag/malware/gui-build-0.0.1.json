During the installation or development process of the Python package (via setup.py), it automatically downloads a Windows executable (Cleaner.exe) from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://a4a08d21-3950-435e-8b39-12ab7788cd10.id.repl.co/Cleaner.exe) without user consent or notification. It then immediately executes this downloaded binary using os.system with a command that may attempt to bypass User Account Control (UAC) via the RunAsInvoker compatibility layer. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code during package installation—is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is exclusively observed in malware samples. There is no legitimate reason for a GUI-building Python package to perform these actions, and the absence of user interaction, logging, or error handling further supports the malicious classification.",
