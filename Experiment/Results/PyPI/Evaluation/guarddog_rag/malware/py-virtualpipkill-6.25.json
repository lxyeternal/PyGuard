      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed without user knowledge. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64-encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in the setup script, so it will run automatically during package installation, potentially compromising any system where the package is installed. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All of these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
