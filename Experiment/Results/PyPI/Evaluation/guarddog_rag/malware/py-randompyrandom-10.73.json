The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and runs it, all without user interaction or notification. This behavior is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary, obfuscated, and potentially harmful code on the victim's system. The use of PowerShell in hidden mode, base64 encoding, silent error suppression, and the lack of any legitimate installation logic are all strong indicators of malware. The code matches multiple critical risk patterns observed exclusively in malware, such as stealthy payload delivery, remote code execution, and anti-detection techniques.",
