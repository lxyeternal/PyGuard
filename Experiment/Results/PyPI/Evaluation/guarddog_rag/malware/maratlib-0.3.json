First, it uses obfuscated variable names and a function (l111_cringe_) that decodes and dynamically executes code via eval on a string reconstructed from a sequence of character manipulations, a classic obfuscation and code injection technique. Second, it executes a shell command during package installation (via __import__('os').system(...)) to download and execute a remote shell script from a suspicious, non-official URL (https://github.com/nedog123/files/raw/main/aza-ob.sh), saving it to /tmp/gay.sh, making it executable, and running it. This enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system without user consent. Third, the malicious actions are embedded in a setup.py context, meaning they will be triggered automatically during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying these actions. The combination of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, remote payload download and execution, and execution during installation is a strong, exclusive indicator of malware.",
