It then immediately executes this file using os.system('start ' + filename) without any user interaction, consent, or notification. This pattern—downloading and executing a remote binary automatically during package installation or script execution—is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware. The code lacks any legitimate business logic, error handling, or user prompts, and the package metadata is generic and suspicious. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine and can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware deployment.",
