      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command. The encoded command (base64) is passed to PowerShell using the '-EncodedCommand' flag and '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The decoded command downloads and/or executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly seen in supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner.",
