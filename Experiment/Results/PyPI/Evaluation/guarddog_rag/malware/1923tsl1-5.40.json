      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior. It checks if the current user is not 'Tahg', then downloads an executable ('esqueleDrp.exe') from a hardcoded Dropbox URL to the user's TEMP directory, adds a registry key to ensure persistence (RunOnce), and executes the downloaded file in a hidden window. These actions are performed without user interaction, consent, or notification. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its activity. The use of a try/except block to silently ignore errors, the execution of a downloaded binary, and the registry modification for persistence are all classic malware techniques. The code is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, indicating a supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate reason for a Python package to perform these actions during installation.",
