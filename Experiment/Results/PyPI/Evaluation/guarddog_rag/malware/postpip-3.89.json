Specifically, if the 'tahg' file or directory does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a classic technique for executing obfuscated or malicious payloads without user consent or visibility. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence indicators of malware: remote payload download and execution, obfuscation via base64 encoding, execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector), and suppression of all exceptions to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
