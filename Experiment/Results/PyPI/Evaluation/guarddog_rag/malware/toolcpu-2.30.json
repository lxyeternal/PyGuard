      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it imports subprocess and os, checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using an encoded command. The encoded command (base64) is passed to PowerShell with the -EncodedCommand flag and -WindowStyle Hidden, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of arbitrary code or payloads. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote, non-standard domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This behavior is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: it executes arbitrary code during package installation, downloads a potentially malicious payload, and runs it without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
