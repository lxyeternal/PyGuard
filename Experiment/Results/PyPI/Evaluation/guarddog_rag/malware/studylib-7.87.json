The command is only executed if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated, but the use of '-EncodedCommand' and the presence of a suspicious, non-standard URL (dl.dropbox.com) in the decoded payload strongly indicate that it downloads and/or executes a remote file or script. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the user's system during package installation without their knowledge or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
