The command is obfuscated and uses '-EncodedCommand', a classic malware technique to evade detection. The encoded payload, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'EsqueleSquad.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a textbook supply chain attack vector, as it will execute automatically when the package is installed, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the check for a non-descriptive file/directory ('tahg'), and the lack of any legitimate business logic further confirm malicious intent. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
