Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is triggered during package installation, uses obfuscation, downloads and executes remote code, and attempts to evade detection by hiding the PowerShell window. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to avoid detection or interruption. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
