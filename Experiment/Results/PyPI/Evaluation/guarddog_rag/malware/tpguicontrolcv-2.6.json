The command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding and is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag to avoid user detection. The decoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling remote code execution on the victim's machine without user consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these characteristics are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign Python packages.",
