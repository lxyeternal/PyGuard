The command is base64-encoded and obfuscated, which is a classic malware technique to evade detection. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote payload from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign Python packages. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand further indicates an attempt to hide execution from the user. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner, especially without user consent or notification. The code is designed to run automatically upon installation, making it highly dangerous.",
