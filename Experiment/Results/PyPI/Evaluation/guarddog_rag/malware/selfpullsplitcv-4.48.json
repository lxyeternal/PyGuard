      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory ('tahg'), and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command. The encoded command (base64) is passed to PowerShell with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The decoded command downloads and/or executes a file from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes them. This is a classic supply chain attack vector, often seen in malicious PyPI packages, where code is executed at install time (via setup.py or similar scripts) to compromise the system. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a package setup script to download and execute binaries from the internet without user consent. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks.",
