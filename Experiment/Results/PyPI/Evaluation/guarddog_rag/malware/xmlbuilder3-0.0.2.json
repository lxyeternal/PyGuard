This means that arbitrary code within the 'poc_nvk.my_module' module will be executed automatically on the user's system during installation, without user consent or notification. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution at install time. The package name ('xmlbuilder3') and description ('DEPEndency C0nfusion P0C for Mirantis') further suggest this is a proof-of-concept for a dependency confusion attack, a known supply chain threat vector. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute arbitrary code during installation in this manner, especially without clear user-facing justification or documentation.",

This pattern—gathering system information and sending it to a non-corporate, non-standard domain—is a hallmark of information-stealing malware and is not observed in benign software. The absence of user-facing features, documentation, or clear justification for this data transfer further elevates the risk. The use of the requests library to transmit this data, combined with the hardcoded external endpoint, matches well-established malicious exfiltration techniques.",
