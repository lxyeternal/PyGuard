      "malicious_behavior": "This code is clearly malicious. It attempts to steal the user's credentials by presenting fake authentication dialogs on Linux (using zenity), macOS (using osascript), and Windows (using PowerShell's Get-Credential). It collects the username, hostname, and the entered password, then exfiltrates this sensitive information to an external, suspicious endpoint (https://en0w6ukj0qarx.x.pipedream.net/) via HTTP POST requests. The code runs automatically upon execution, without user consent or legitimate purpose, and uses techniques (fake prompts, credential collection, exfiltration to a hardcoded external server) that are strongly associated with credential-stealing malware. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or error handling for these actions, and the endpoint is not associated with any known, reputable service.",
