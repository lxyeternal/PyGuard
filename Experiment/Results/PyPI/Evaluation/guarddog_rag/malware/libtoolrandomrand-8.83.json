Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered during package installation, is obfuscated, downloads and executes a remote payload, and attempts to evade detection by hiding the window and suppressing all exceptions. The use of a suspicious domain, encoded payload, and execution during install time are all strong indicators of malware.",
