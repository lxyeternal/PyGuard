The PowerShell command is obfuscated and is executed only if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common anti-analysis or anti-redundancy technique. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell commands; (2) download and execution of remote code without user consent; (3) execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector); (4) use of hidden process creation to evade detection. These patterns are exclusively observed in malware and are never present in benign software.",
