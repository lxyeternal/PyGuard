      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the setup process if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for hiding malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery: it downloads and runs an untrusted executable from the internet without user consent, during package installation, and attempts to evade detection by hiding the PowerShell window. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
