      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command during the package installation process (in the setup.py script). The command is obfuscated and uses '-EncodedCommand', a common technique for hiding the true intent of the payload. The PowerShell command downloads and/or executes content from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and writes it to a file in the user's home directory (WindowsCache.exe), then attempts to execute it. This is a classic supply chain attack vector, as the code is triggered automatically upon installation of the package, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
