The command is base64-encoded and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, a classic obfuscation and evasion technique. Decoding the base64 reveals that it downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) using PowerShell, saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs them. This is a textbook supply chain attack: the code is triggered automatically on install, downloads and executes remote payloads, and uses obfuscation and exception suppression to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware.",
