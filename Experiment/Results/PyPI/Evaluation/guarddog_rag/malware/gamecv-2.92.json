      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: during installation (in the setup.py script), it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the command. Decoding the base64 reveals that it downloads an executable (Esquele.exe) from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a textbook supply chain attack: the code is triggered during package installation, downloads and executes a remote payload, and uses obfuscation and exception suppression to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware.",
