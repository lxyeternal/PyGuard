(2) It decodes and decompresses payloads using base64, zlib, and codecs, then immediately executes the resulting code, a classic malware pattern for hiding and delivering secondary payloads. (3) The code sets built-in attributes to obfuscated values, which is a known anti-analysis and anti-debugging technique. (4) There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation; all code is focused on obfuscation and dynamic execution. (5) The code includes suspicious, encoded data blobs and reconstructs code at runtime, which is a hallmark of malware delivery and execution. (6) The code is structured to evade static analysis and detection, and could easily be used to download, execute, or exfiltrate data without user consent. All these behaviors are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign software.",
