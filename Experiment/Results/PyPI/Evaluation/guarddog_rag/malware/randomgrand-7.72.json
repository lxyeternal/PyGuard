      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command during the package setup process, specifically if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and executed with '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a classic technique for stealthy execution. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, non-transparent URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is triggered during installation (setup.py), is obfuscated, downloads and executes a remote payload, and does so without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, and there are no legitimate reasons for such actions in a package setup script.",
