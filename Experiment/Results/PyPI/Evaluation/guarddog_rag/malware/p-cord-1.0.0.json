It defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that, during package installation on Windows systems, dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware. The use of encrypted payloads, dynamic code execution during installation, and obfuscated author/package metadata are all critical risk indicators. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is designed to execute arbitrary, hidden code on the victim's machine without consent, making it highly dangerous.",
