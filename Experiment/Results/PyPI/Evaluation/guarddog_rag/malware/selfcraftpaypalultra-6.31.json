      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is provided in base64-encoded form via the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The decoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence malware indicators: (1) obfuscated payload delivery, (2) remote code download and execution, (3) execution of code during package installation (supply chain attack vector), (4) use of try/except to suppress errors and evade detection, and (5) lack of user interaction or consent. The presence of a suspicious author and email, as well as a non-standard directory check, further supports the malicious classification.",
