      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and classic malware pattern: it uses a try/except block to silently execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen during package installation or import. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and uses '-WindowStyle Hidden' to suppress the window, which is a common technique to evade user detection. The decoded command downloads and executes a payload from a remote, hardcoded, and obfuscated URL (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code download and execution, obfuscation, error suppression, and execution during install time (setup.py abuse). The use of a hidden directory/file check ('tahg') is also a known evasion technique. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script, and it is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware distribution via Python packages.",
