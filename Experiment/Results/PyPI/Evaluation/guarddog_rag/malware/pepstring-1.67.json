      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with the -EncodedCommand flag. The command is base64-encoded, which is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the payload from static analysis and security tools. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file (likely an executable) from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence malware indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded shell commands; (2) downloading and executing code from an external source without user consent; (3) use of hidden PowerShell windows to evade user detection; (4) execution during package setup, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a Python package setup script to perform these actions.",
