The encoded PowerShell command is passed to 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...', which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, especially in the context of a Python package setup script, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the lack of any legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script further support the assessment that this is a supply chain attack vector, commonly used to deliver malware via package installation.",
