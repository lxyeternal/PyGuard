Specifically, it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious code is triggered during package installation, downloads and executes a remote payload, and does so without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and remote payload delivery are all strong indicators of malware. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its behavior.",
