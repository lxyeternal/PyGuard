      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (i.e., in setup.py). This is triggered if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent and evade detection. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware: remote code download and execution, obfuscation, execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector), and lack of user notification or consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides malicious activity. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
