It defines a custom setuptools install command (GruppeInstall) that, during package installation on Windows systems, dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is used exclusively in malware samples. The use of encrypted, obfuscated payloads and dynamic code execution during installation is a critical risk, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. There is no legitimate reason for a package install script to execute hidden, encrypted code in this manner. The package metadata (name, author, description) is also suspicious and non-descriptive, further supporting the malicious classification.",
