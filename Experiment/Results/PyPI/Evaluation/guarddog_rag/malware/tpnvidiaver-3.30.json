Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and/or executes content from a suspicious external URL (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never seen in benign Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, the obfuscated payload, and the execution of remote code all indicate clear malicious intent.",
