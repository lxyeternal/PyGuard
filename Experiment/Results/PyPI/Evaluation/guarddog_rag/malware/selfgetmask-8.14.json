      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed without user consent or visibility. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64-encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs them. This behavior is a hallmark of malware: it downloads and executes remote code, uses obfuscation, and is triggered during package installation (setup.py), making it a supply chain attack vector. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and all observed patterns match known malicious behaviors.",
