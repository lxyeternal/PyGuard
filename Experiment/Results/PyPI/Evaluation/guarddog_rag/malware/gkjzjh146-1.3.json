      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (PostInstallCommand) that, upon package installation, executes a function (reverse_shell) which establishes a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded external IP address (49.233.121.53:54). The host and port are obfuscated using base64 encoding. The reverse_shell function redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to the socket, then spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i), effectively granting remote shell access to the attacker's server. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, as the code is executed automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation, hardcoded external IP, and execution of a shell with redirected I/O are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
