The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious payload is delivered and executed automatically upon installation or import of the package. The use of subprocess.Popen with PowerShell in hidden mode, the obfuscated payload, the external download, and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user notification are all strong indicators of malware. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python-based supply chain attacks.",
