It then sets the file as executable and appends a command to the user's .bashrc to run this file on every shell startup, establishing persistence. There is no user notification, validation, or integrity check of the downloaded file, and the code is only executed on Linux systems. These behaviors—downloading and executing remote code, establishing persistence via .bashrc modification, and using a non-corporate, hardcoded IP—are all strong indicators of malware, as they match well-known malicious patterns and are not found in benign software.",

It downloads a file from a hardcoded external IP address (145.249.104.71) over HTTP, writes the downloaded content as a binary file named '.drv' in the user's home directory, sets the file as executable, appends a command to run this file in the user's .bashrc (establishing persistence), and then immediately executes the file using os.system. These actions are performed automatically during package installation (via setup.py), without user consent, validation, or any legitimate business logic. The use of a hidden file, direct execution of a remotely downloaded binary, and persistence via .bashrc modification are all strong indicators of malware, particularly supply chain attacks targeting Python environments. There is no legitimate reason for a package installer to perform these actions, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
