      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a highly obfuscated PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and run with '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a classic malware technique to hide execution from the user. The decoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com), specifically an executable named 'Esquele.exe', and saves it to the user's home directory. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is embedded in a setup script to download and run arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware.",
