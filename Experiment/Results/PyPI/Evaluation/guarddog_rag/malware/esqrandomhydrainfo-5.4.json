      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a PowerShell command in hidden mode using an encoded (base64) payload. The encoded command downloads and/or executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic supply chain attack vector, as the code is embedded in a setup script and will execute automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of PowerShell with -EncodedCommand, hidden window, and remote payload retrieval is a hallmark of malware, especially in Python packages targeting Windows systems. The code is obfuscated, lacks legitimate business logic, and is designed to evade detection and user awareness.",
