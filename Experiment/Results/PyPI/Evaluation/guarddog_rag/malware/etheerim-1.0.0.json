It overrides the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary, obfuscated, and encrypted code during package installation, specifically on Windows systems. The install hook imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' (from cryptography), then decrypts and executes a payload using exec() on the decrypted data. The payload is stored as an encrypted blob in the source code, making static analysis difficult and hiding its true intent. This pattern is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where arbitrary code is executed on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution is exclusively observed in malware and never in benign software. There is no legitimate installation logic; the install command is abused solely for malicious payload execution.",
