It defines a custom setuptools install command (InstallCommand) that, during package installation, downloads a remote Python script (WindowsUpdate.py) from a suspicious, non-official GitHub URL and immediately executes it using subprocess with shell=True. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware. The downloaded code is executed without any validation, user notification, or consent, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The package metadata (name, description) is also suspicious ('Python File Crypter FUD'), further indicating malicious intent. The use of a custom install hook to execute remote code is never seen in benign software and is a critical risk vector for remote code execution, system compromise, and further payload delivery.",
