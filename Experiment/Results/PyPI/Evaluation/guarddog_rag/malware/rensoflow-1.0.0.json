      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly indicative of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack via a Python package. The setup.py script defines a custom install command class with an obfuscated, randomly generated name. During installation (on Windows), it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet. The payload is not visible in the source code, making its intent opaque and preventing static analysis. This pattern—encrypted payload delivery, dynamic code execution via exec, obfuscated class names, and execution during package installation—is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute hidden, encrypted code at install time, and this technique is used exclusively in malware to evade detection and deliver secondary payloads.",
