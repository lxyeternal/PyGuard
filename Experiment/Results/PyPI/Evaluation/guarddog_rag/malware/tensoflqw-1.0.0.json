The setup.py script defines a custom install command class with an obfuscated name. During installation (on Windows), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then uses Fernet to decrypt an encrypted payload and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). The payload is not visible in the source, is encrypted, and is only decrypted and executed at install time, which is a classic malware delivery technique. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never present in benign code. The use of strong obfuscation (encryption, random class name), dynamic code execution, and execution during package installation without user consent are all critical risk indicators. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute hidden, encrypted code during installation, and this is a well-known vector for supply chain attacks.",
