      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious payloads on Windows systems. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW ensures the process is invisible to the user, further increasing stealth. The encoded payload, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote server (the URL is obfuscated in the base64 string), which is a classic malware delivery and execution technique. This behavior is highly indicative of a supply chain attack, as it is embedded in what appears to be a setup script for a Python package. The use of try/except to suppress errors and avoid detection further supports the malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute remote code in this manner.",
