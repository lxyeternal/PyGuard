      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a classic example of an information-stealing malware (token grabber) targeting Discord and browser data. It searches for Discord and browser tokens in various application directories, decrypts them using the system's master key, and validates them by making requests to the Discord API. Upon successful validation, it collects sensitive user information (username, email, phone, MFA status, Nitro subscription, IP address, PC username, computer name, and the decrypted token itself). This data is then exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled Discord webhook. The code also collects the victim's public IP address by making a request to https://api.ipify.org, which is a common technique for fingerprinting and tracking victims. The use of win32crypt, AES decryption, and the targeting of browser/Discord data directories are all strong indicators of credential theft. The code is heavily obfuscated with try/except blocks to suppress errors and evade detection. There is no user notification or legitimate business logic present; the sole purpose is covert data theft and exfiltration.",
