      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (i.e., in the setup.py script). Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: executing arbitrary, obfuscated code during package installation, downloading and running a remote executable, and attempting to evade detection by hiding the process window and suppressing all exceptions. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the obfuscated payload, and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user notification are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
