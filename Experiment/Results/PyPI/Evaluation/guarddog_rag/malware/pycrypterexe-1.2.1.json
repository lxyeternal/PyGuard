It collects highly sensitive information from the victim's system, including WiFi passwords, Chrome browser passwords and cookies, and Discord authentication tokens. It exfiltrates this data to an external Discord webhook (hardcoded in the source), which is a common tactic for information-stealing malware. The code also implements a reverse shell (RAT) capability, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine by connecting to a specified IP and port. The use of random filenames in system directories, the lack of user notification or consent, the use of win32crypt to decrypt protected data, and the automated upload of stolen files to external servers (e.g., gofile.io) further confirm its malicious intent. The code is obfuscated via class encapsulation and misleading comments, and it is labeled as 'SylexPIP Malware', which is a known malware family. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality; all actions are focused on data theft and remote control.",
