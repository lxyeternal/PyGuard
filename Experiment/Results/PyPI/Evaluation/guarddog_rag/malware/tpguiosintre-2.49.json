      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command during the package setup phase. Specifically, if the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution and payload delivery. The decoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it, then attempts to invoke another executable ('WindowsCache.exe'). This behavior is highly indicative of a supply chain attack, as it enables remote code execution on the victim's system during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never present in benign code.",
