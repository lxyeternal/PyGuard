      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command during package installation (in the setup.py file). Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, runs a base64-encoded PowerShell command with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand'. Decoding the base64 payload reveals that it downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a critical risk pattern, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent, and is a hallmark of malicious PyPI packages and supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and remote payload delivery are all strong indicators of malware.",
