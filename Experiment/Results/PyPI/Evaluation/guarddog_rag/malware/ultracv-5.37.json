This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell commands to be executed without user knowledge. The command is triggered during the setup process (i.e., when the package is installed), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its behavior. The base64-encoded PowerShell command appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a strong indicator of malware delivery or remote code execution. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute hidden, obfuscated PowerShell commands that download and run remote executables.",
