If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic malware technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious code on the victim's system without their knowledge. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, the obfuscated payload, and the execution during installation (supply chain attack vector) are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely downloads and/or executes further payloads from a remote server, as suggested by the presence of a suspicious URL in the decoded string. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python supply chain attacks.",
