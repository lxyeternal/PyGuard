      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in setup.py). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command. The decoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory and then running it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands, (2) download and execution of remote code without user consent, (3) use of hidden process creation to evade detection, (4) embedding this logic in a setup script to trigger on package installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks), and (5) use of a suspicious or attacker-controlled domain. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a benign Python package.",
