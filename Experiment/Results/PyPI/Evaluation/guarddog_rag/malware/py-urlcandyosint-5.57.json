      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the setup process if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a common technique in malware to hide the true intent of the command. The decoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the user's system during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user interaction, and the obfuscation of the payload further indicate malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
