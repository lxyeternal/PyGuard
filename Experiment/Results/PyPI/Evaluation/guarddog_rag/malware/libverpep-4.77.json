In the setup script, before the legitimate setup() call, it checks if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, executes a highly obfuscated PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and is run with '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a strong indicator of intent to hide execution from the user. The decoded command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then invokes it. This is a textbook example of a malicious payload delivery mechanism, designed to run automatically during package installation (supply chain attack). The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
