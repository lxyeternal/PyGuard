The base64-encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in the setup script, so it will execute automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the obfuscated command, the lack of user interaction, and the use of a non-corporate, suspicious domain all strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of malware propagation and remote code execution.",
