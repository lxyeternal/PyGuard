Specifically, if the 'tahg' file or directory does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and attempts to run it, likely as a secondary payload. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never seen in benign Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, and the execution of remote code during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
