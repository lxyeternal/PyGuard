      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a classic malware technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The base64-encoded PowerShell command decodes to a script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded commands; (2) downloading and executing code from an external source without user consent; (3) use of hidden windows to evade user detection; (4) execution during package installation (setup.py), which is a common supply chain attack vector. The code is also wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, and are never observed in benign software.",
