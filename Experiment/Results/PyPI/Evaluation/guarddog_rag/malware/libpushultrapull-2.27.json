      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The command is base64-encoded and executed in hidden mode, which is a classic technique for stealthy code execution and payload delivery. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence malware indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded shell commands; (2) downloading and executing a remote payload without user consent; (3) use of hidden process creation to evade detection; (4) execution during package setup, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The code is also wrapped in try/except blocks to suppress errors and avoid detection. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script, and it is never observed in benign software.",
