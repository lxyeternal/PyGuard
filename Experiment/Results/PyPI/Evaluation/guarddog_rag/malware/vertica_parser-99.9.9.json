It then exfiltrates this data to an external, hardcoded domain (uchpuchmak.lol) using custom DNS requests, which is a stealthy and non-standard method for data exfiltration that can bypass many network monitoring tools. The use of a custom DNS request function, encoding the data as hex, and splitting it into chunks for transmission further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware, as it abuses the package installation process to leak environment details to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate reason for a package to perform these actions during installation, and the behavior matches known malicious patterns in Python malware.",
