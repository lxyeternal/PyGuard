It abuses the Python package installation process by defining a custom install command (via the 'cmdclass' argument in setup()) that executes arbitrary, hidden code during installation. Specifically, the custom install class 'unixYadVKYAtciRLyqlbgcIJHxvfSbRJiPCXjPfCvGXbTjNmlRWfCtxIJaVTsoUXSBziZUXFYBGNcbt' overrides the 'run' method to import 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts and immediately executes (via exec) an encrypted payload. The payload is hidden using Fernet symmetric encryption, and the decryption key and ciphertext are hardcoded. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious code is executed automatically on install, without user consent or notification, and the actual payload is obfuscated and hidden from static analysis. The use of strong obfuscation (encryption, random class name), dynamic code execution (exec), and the abuse of the package installation process are all strong indicators of malware, as confirmed by the knowledge base. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute encrypted, hidden code during installation.",
