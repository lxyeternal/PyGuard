      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior: it executes a hidden PowerShell command with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) payload during the package setup process. Specifically, if the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution and payload delivery. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is executed during package installation, potentially compromising the system without user consent or awareness. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
