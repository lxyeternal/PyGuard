      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command during the package setup process. Specifically, if the 'tahg' file or directory does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command in hidden mode using the '-EncodedCommand' flag. The encoded payload, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and attempts to run it, likely as a secondary payload. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages.",
