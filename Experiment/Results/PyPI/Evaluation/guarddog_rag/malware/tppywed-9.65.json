The encoded command is passed to PowerShell via the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing potentially harmful or remote code without user consent or visibility. The use of subprocess.Popen with a hidden window and encoded PowerShell command is a hallmark of malware, especially in supply chain attacks targeting Python package installation. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script, and the presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' further increases suspicion. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never found in benign software.",
