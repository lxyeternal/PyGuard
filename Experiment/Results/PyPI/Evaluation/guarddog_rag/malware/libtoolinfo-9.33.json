      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py context). Specifically, it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it launches a PowerShell process with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and attempts to run it, as well as another executable (WindowsCache.exe) from the user's home directory. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: execution of obfuscated, encoded commands; downloading and running remote executables; execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector); use of try/except to suppress errors and evade detection; and use of a suspicious, non-corporate domain. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples.",
