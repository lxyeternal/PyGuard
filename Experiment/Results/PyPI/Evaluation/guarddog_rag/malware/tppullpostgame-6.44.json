      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is provided as a long base64-encoded string, which is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. Decoding the base64 reveals that the PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), specifically a file named 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation or setup, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is a strong indicator of malware, especially in the context of Python packages and supply chain attacks.",
