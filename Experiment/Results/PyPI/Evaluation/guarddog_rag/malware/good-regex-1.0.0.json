      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command (CustomInstall) for a Python package. During installation (i.e., when pip install is run), it collects sensitive system information: the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (fo7288ar9hjgo6tp8p6c1efxpovgja7z.oastify.com), which is a known interaction/collaboration endpoint often used for exfiltration and testing in security research. This exfiltration occurs automatically, without user consent or notification, and is not justified by any legitimate package functionality. The use of a custom install command to perform this action is a classic supply chain attack vector, and the pattern of collecting and exfiltrating host-specific information to an external server is a hallmark of credential-stealing or reconnaissance malware. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a benign package, and this pattern is observed exclusively in malicious samples.",
