It defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class names, a misleading package name ('BeaotifulSoup', a typosquat of 'BeautifulSoup'), and the presence of encrypted payloads further indicate an attempt to evade detection and deliver a hidden malicious payload. The code is specifically targeted at Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), and the decrypted payload could perform any action, including data exfiltration, credential theft, or further compromise. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a strong indicator of malware.",
