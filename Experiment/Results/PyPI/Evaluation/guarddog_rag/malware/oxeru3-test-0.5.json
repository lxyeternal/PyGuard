      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. Specifically: (1) The createfile() function collects sensitive system information, including OS details, platform, and the host's IP address, and then exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64) over a raw TCP socket, without user consent or notification. (2) This exfiltration is triggered automatically during package installation by hooking into the setuptools install command via the PostInstallCommand class and the cmdclass argument in setup(). This ensures the malicious code runs as a side effect of installing the package, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (3) There is no legitimate user-facing functionality, documentation, or error handling around these operations, and the use of a hardcoded, non-corporate IP address is highly suspicious. (4) The code is not part of any known, reputable open-source project and the package metadata appears generic or misleading. All these factors, in combination, match multiple high-confidence indicators of malicious Python code as outlined in the provided knowledge base.",
