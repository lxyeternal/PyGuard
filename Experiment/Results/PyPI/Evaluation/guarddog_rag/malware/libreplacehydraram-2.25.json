The encoded PowerShell command (base64) is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the payload. The command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in the setup script, runs automatically on install, and attempts to download and execute a remote payload without user consent or notification. The use of a hidden window, encoded command, and silent error suppression (broad try/except) further indicate malicious intent and an attempt to evade detection.",
