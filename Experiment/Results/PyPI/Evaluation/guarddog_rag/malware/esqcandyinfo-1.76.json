The command is run only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated, but the use of '-EncodedCommand' and the presence of a suspicious, non-corporate URL (dl.dropbox.com) in the encoded string strongly indicate that it downloads and/or executes a remote payload. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python packages, enabling arbitrary code execution on user systems during package installation. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, and the obfuscation via base64 encoding further reinforce the malicious nature of the code.",
