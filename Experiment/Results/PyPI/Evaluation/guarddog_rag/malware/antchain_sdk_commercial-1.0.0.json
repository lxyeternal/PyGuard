It defines a custom installation command (CustomInstall) for a Python package, which is executed automatically when the package is installed (e.g., via pip). During installation, it collects sensitive information from the victim's system, including the hostname, current working directory, and username, without user consent or notification. It then exfiltrates this data to an external, hardcoded, suspicious domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io) via an HTTP GET request. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and dependency confusion attacks, where malicious code is executed during package installation to steal information or compromise systems. The use of a custom install command to perform data exfiltration, especially to a non-legitimate, external endpoint, is a strong and exclusive indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a package setup script to collect and transmit this information externally.",
