The command is base64-encoded, which is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the payload. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This behavior is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: it executes arbitrary, obfuscated code during package installation, without user consent or notification, and is designed to evade detection by running in a hidden window. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. All these behaviors are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign software.",
