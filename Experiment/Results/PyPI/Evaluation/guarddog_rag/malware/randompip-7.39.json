      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a file ('tahg'), and if not present, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using an encoded command. The encoded command is base64-encoded PowerShell, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of arbitrary or malicious payloads. The command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, obfuscated URL (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a classic malware dropper pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks via Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the obfuscated payload, and the execution of a remote binary without user consent are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is a textbook example of a supply chain attack.",
