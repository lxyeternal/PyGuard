      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process of a Python package (via setup.py). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and/or executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns associated exclusively with malware, including: (1) execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands, (2) downloading and executing remote payloads, (3) running code during package installation (supply chain attack vector), (4) use of try/except to suppress errors and evade detection, and (5) lack of user notification or consent. The code is designed to execute automatically upon installation, making it highly dangerous and a clear example of a supply chain attack.",
