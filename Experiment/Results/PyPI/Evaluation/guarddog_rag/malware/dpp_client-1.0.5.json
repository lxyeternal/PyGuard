(2) It collects a directory listing of the parent directory ('./../'), which may expose user files or project contents. (3) It immediately exfiltrates this data via an HTTP POST request to an external, hardcoded URL (http://pt.traktrain.com/req.php) without any user notification, consent, or legitimate purpose. (4) This data collection and exfiltration occurs at the top level of the setup.py file, meaning it will execute automatically during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. (5) There is no error handling, logging, or legitimate justification for these actions. All of these behaviors are strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
