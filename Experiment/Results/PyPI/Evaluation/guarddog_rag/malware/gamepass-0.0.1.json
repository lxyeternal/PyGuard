      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple, critical indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware and information stealers. Key points include: (1) It downloads remote content from attacker-controlled URLs (e.g., rentry.co, Discord webhooks) and uses the responses as configuration or payloads. (2) It collects highly sensitive data from the victim's system, including browser cookies, saved passwords, Discord tokens, and files from common user directories (Desktop, Documents, Downloads). (3) It decrypts browser-stored credentials using Windows DPAPI, a technique used exclusively by malware for credential theft. (4) It exfiltrates all collected data to an external Discord webhook, which is a common C2/exfiltration method for modern stealers. (5) It achieves persistence by copying itself to the Windows startup folder. (6) It includes anti-debugging and anti-VM checks to evade analysis. (7) It uploads files to gofile.io, a public file hosting service, and sends the download links to the attacker's webhook. (8) It injects malicious JavaScript into Discord installations to steal future credentials/tokens. (9) The code is heavily obfuscated, uses non-standard variable names, and lacks any legitimate user-facing functionality. (10) There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate reason for any of these actions. All of these behaviors are hallmarks of credential-stealing malware, and none are found in benign software.",
