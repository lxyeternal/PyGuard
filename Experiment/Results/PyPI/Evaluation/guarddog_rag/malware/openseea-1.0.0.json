It abuses the setuptools install hook by defining a custom install class that, during package installation, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then uses Fernet decryption with a hardcoded key to decrypt an opaque, encrypted payload. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and Python malware, as it allows arbitrary, hidden code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or visibility. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and execution in the install hook is never seen in benign software and is a critical risk indicator. The code also dynamically installs dependencies (requests, fernet) to ensure the payload can run, further increasing the risk. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script.",
