      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It subclasses the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary code during package installation. Specifically, in the Updater class, the run() method constructs an obfuscated URL pointing to a Discord CDN (cdn.discordapp.com) and downloads a remote Python file (qrcodegen.py) using the requests library. It then writes this file to disk and immediately executes it using subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, 'qrcodegen.py']). This pattern—downloading and executing remote code during installation, especially from a non-standard, hardcoded, and obfuscated URL, without any integrity or authenticity checks, and without user consent—is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and Python malware. The use of obfuscated variable names and string concatenation further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine at install time, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware deployment.",
