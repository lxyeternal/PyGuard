The command is base64-encoded and obfuscated, and it is executed only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a common technique in malware to hide the true intent of the payload and evade static analysis. The encoded payload appears to download and/or execute a file from an external, non-standard domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is not related to the stated purpose of the package. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: (1) arbitrary code execution at install time, (2) obfuscated payload delivery, (3) use of hidden process execution, (4) download and execution of remote code, and (5) lack of user notification or consent. These patterns are exclusively observed in malware and are never present in benign Python packages.",
