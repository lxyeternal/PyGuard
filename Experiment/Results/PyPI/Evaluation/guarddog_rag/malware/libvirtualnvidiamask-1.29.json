The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and obfuscated, which is a classic malware technique to evade detection. The decoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest, saving it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory and then executing it. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware: it downloads and runs arbitrary code from the internet without user consent, during package installation, and attempts to hide its activity by running PowerShell in hidden mode. The use of a check for a file named 'tahg' is a primitive persistence or anti-redundancy mechanism. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
