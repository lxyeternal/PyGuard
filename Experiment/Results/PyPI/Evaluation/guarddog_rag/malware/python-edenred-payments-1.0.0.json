      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install hook (CustomInstall) that is executed automatically during package installation. In the run() method, it collects sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, and username) and immediately exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (cdf5rwk2vtc0000c78d0ggz1hqeyyyyyb.oast.fun). This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. The use of a non-standard, likely attacker-controlled domain, the lack of user notification or consent, and the execution of this code during installation (when users do not expect such actions) are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a package install script to collect and transmit this information, and this pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples.",
