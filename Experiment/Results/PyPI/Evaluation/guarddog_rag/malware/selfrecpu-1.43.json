      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a highly obfuscated PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and run in hidden window mode, which is a classic technique for stealthy execution of secondary payloads or remote code. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and then running it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation or setup, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never found in benign software.",
