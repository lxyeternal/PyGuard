This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell commands to be executed without user knowledge. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64-encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior is strongly associated with malware, particularly supply chain attacks via Python packages, as it enables remote code execution and potential system compromise during package installation. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
