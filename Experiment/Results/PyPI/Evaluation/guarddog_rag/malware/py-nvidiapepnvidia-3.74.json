The command is run only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated, but it is likely designed to download and execute a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and save it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded shell commands during package installation (supply chain attack vector), (2) downloading and executing remote files, (3) use of try/except to suppress errors and evade detection, (4) lack of user notification or consent, and (5) use of a suspicious, non-corporate domain. These are all strong indicators of malware, especially in the context of a setup script for a Python package.",
