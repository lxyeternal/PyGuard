There is no user interaction, notification, or validation of the downloaded file. The use of a hidden/system-like directory, the lack of integrity checks, and the immediate execution of a remote payload are all strong indicators of malware. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a textbook example of a dropper or loader, which is used to deliver and execute additional malicious payloads on the victim's system.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads two Windows executable files (ZYXMN.exe and ZYRBX.exe) from hardcoded Discord CDN URLs, writes them to disk, renames them to appear as Windows system files in a suspiciously named directory (C:\\$Windows.~SXK), and then immediately executes both files using os.startfile. After execution, it attempts to delete the original files and the directory, likely to cover its tracks. There is no user interaction, notification, or validation of the downloaded files, and the actions are performed during the package installation process (as the code is placed in setup.py). This pattern is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where arbitrary code is executed on the victim's machine during package installation. The use of Discord CDN for payload delivery, the lack of integrity checks, the execution of untrusted binaries, and the attempt to hide and clean up after execution are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior is never observed in benign software and matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware.",
