It overrides the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary, obfuscated, and encrypted code during the package installation process, specifically on Windows systems. The install hook imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then uses Fernet to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is immediately executed via exec(). The payload is not visible in the source, making its behavior opaque and likely harmful. This pattern is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: it abuses the installation process to run hidden code, uses obfuscation and encryption to evade detection, and leverages dynamic imports and execution. The package name 'selemiumm' is a typosquat of 'selenium', further indicating malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute hidden, encrypted code on install, especially without user interaction or notification.",
