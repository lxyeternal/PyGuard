It then queries an external geolocation API to enrich the IP data. All of this information is formatted and sent via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded webhook URL, which is obfuscated using base64 encoding. The webhook URL decodes to 'https://dude.ong/api/proxy', which is not a standard or well-known endpoint and is likely attacker-controlled. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data exfiltration. The use of base64 encoding to hide the webhook URL is a classic obfuscation technique seen in malware. This pattern—collecting host/user/network information and exfiltrating it to an external, obfuscated endpoint without user consent—is a hallmark of information-stealing malware.",
