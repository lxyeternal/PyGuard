The command is passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for executing arbitrary, potentially harmful code in a stealthy manner. The encoded payload, when decoded, downloads and/or executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware: it downloads and runs a remote payload without user consent, uses obfuscation to evade detection, and executes during package installation (setup.py), which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions.",
