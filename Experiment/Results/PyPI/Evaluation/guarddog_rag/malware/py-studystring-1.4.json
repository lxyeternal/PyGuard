Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the target system during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
