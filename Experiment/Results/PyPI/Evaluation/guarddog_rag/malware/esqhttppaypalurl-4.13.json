Specifically, it checks for the absence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if not present, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command decodes to a script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious code is triggered during package installation, downloads and executes a remote payload, and does so without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and external payload delivery are all strong indicators of malware. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its behavior.",
