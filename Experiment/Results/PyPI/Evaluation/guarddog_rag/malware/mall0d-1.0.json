It collects sensitive data from browsers (passwords, cookies, tokens, wallet files), exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook (C2), and uploads files to external services (transfer.sh). It programmatically kills processes (e.g., browsers, Steam) to access locked files, installs dependencies at runtime, and uses threading for stealthy, parallel data theft. The code targets browser and Discord data directories, decrypts stored credentials, and sends them externally without user consent. It also attempts to evade detection and includes no legitimate user-facing functionality. The presence of hardcoded webhooks, dynamic code execution, and automated data exfiltration to non-corporate domains are all hallmarks of malware, specifically information stealers often distributed via supply chain attacks or malicious packages.",
