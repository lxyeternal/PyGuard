The encoded PowerShell command (EncodedCommand) is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. The command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then invokes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation (setup.py). The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user interaction or notification, the obfuscated payload delivery, and the execution of a remote binary are all strong indicators of malware. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malicious activity.",
