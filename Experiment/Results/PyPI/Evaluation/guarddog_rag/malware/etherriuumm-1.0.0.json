The setup.py script defines a custom install command (with an obfuscated class name) that, during installation, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet. The payload is not visible in the source code, making its intent and actions opaque and preventing static analysis. This pattern—executing dynamically decrypted code at install time, especially with obfuscated class names and no user interaction or consent—is a hallmark of Python malware, particularly those distributed via typosquatted or malicious PyPI packages. The use of exec on decrypted data is a critical risk, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute hidden, encrypted code during installation, and this technique is exclusively observed in malware samples.",
