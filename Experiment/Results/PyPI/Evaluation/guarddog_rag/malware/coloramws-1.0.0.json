      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It abuses the Python package installation process by defining a custom install command (GruppeInstall) that executes hidden, encrypted code during installation. Specifically, during installation on Windows systems, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and immediately executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The payload is not visible in the source code, making its intent and actions opaque and preventing static analysis. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, commonly used in malicious PyPI packages to deliver and execute arbitrary code on victim systems without user consent. The use of exec on decrypted data, the obfuscated and non-descriptive package metadata, and the lack of any legitimate package functionality are all strong indicators of malware. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a critical risk for remote code execution and system compromise.",
