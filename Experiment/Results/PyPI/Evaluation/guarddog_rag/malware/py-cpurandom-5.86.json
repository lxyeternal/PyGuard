The command is base64-encoded and is run with -WindowStyle Hidden, which is a classic technique for stealthy execution of malicious payloads on Windows systems. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware: it downloads and executes a remote binary without user consent, uses obfuscation (base64 encoding), and attempts to hide its execution. The use of a try/except block to suppress errors further increases suspicion, as it is a common evasion technique. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and malicious PyPI packages.",
