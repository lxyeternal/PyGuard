      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command (base64) is passed to PowerShell with the -EncodedCommand flag and -WindowStyle Hidden, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The decoded command downloads and/or executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code download and execution, obfuscation via base64 encoding, use of hidden PowerShell windows, and execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate justification for this behavior in a setup script. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion.",
