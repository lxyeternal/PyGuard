      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (i.e., in the setup.py script). Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and/or executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery: it leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code, downloads a remote executable, and runs it without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and external payload delivery is strongly associated with malware and is never seen in benign Python packages.",
