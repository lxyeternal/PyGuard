      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior. On line 8, it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a PowerShell command in hidden window mode using an encoded command string. The encoded command (Base64) is passed to PowerShell with the '-WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The decoded command downloads and/or executes a remote file (likely a malicious payload) from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then invokes it. This is a classic dropper/loader pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks via trojanized Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, the obfuscated payload, and the abuse of the package setup process for code execution all strongly indicate malicious intent.",
