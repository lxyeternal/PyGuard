      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed on the victim's machine without user consent or visibility. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64-encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and attempts to run it, potentially compromising the system. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides the malicious activity. Embedding this logic in a setup script means it will be triggered during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
