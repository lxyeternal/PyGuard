      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It is a classic example of a supply chain attack via a malicious setup.py script. The CustomInstall class overrides the setuptools install command, so the code is executed automatically during package installation. The script collects extensive system and user information, including the output of 'uname -a', 'systeminfo', 'ifconfig', 'ipconfig', the current working directory, the public IP address (via an external service), the username (whoami), and the hostname. It then exfiltrates all this data to a hardcoded Slack webhook via an HTTP POST request. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this data collection and exfiltration. The use of os.popen to execute shell commands and requests to send data externally, especially during installation, is a hallmark of Python malware and supply chain attacks. The code matches multiple high-confidence malicious patterns: data exfiltration, execution of shell commands, use of a custom install hook, and hardcoded external endpoints.",
