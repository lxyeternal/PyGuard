      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (i.e., in setup.py). Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads an executable ('Esquele.exe') from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. It then attempts to execute this file. This pattern matches several critical risk indicators: execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands, downloading and running remote executables, use of hidden windows to evade user detection, and embedding this logic in a setup script to trigger during package installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks). The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a Python package setup script to perform these actions.",
