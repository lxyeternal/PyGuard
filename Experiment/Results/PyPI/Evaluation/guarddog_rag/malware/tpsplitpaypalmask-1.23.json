Specifically, the subprocess.Popen call on line 9 runs 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...', which is a well-known malware technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The base64-encoded payload is not transparently visible, and there is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate justification for this action in a setup script. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed during package installation. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the creation of a directory named 'tahg' (possibly for staging or persistence) further supports the malicious classification.",
