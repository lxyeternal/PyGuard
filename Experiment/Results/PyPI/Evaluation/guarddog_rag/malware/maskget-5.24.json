      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command during the package setup process. Specifically, if the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution and payload delivery. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from an external, non-transparent URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnytzbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never present in benign software.",
