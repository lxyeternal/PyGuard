The command is base64-encoded and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, a classic obfuscation technique to hide its true intent. Decoding the base64 reveals that it downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) using PowerShell, saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory and then executing it. This is a textbook supply chain attack vector, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign Python packages.",
