      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a highly obfuscated PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and run in hidden window mode, which is a classic technique for stealthy payload delivery, remote code execution, or further malware installation. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign software. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth and evasion. The setup.py script is thus weaponized to execute arbitrary code on installation, which is a critical risk for users and systems.",
