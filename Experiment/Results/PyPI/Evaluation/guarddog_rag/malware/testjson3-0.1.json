The CustomCommand.run() method dynamically imports a function (main) from testjsonn1 and immediately calls it with a hardcoded URL pointing to a remote Python script (hosted on Discord's CDN) and a local filename ('testnp.py'). This pattern is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: it downloads and likely executes code from an untrusted, external source during installation, without user interaction, validation, or notification. The use of a remote, non-standard domain (Discord CDN), the lack of integrity checks, and the execution of arbitrary code as part of the install process are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior is never observed in benign packages and is a hallmark of Python malware and supply chain attacks.",
