      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a classic example of an information-stealing malware (infostealer) targeting Windows systems. It exhibits multiple critical risk behaviors: (1) It searches for and extracts sensitive data such as browser cookies, saved passwords, Discord tokens, and cryptocurrency wallet files from well-known locations (AppData, Local, Roaming, browser directories, wallet folders, Telegram data, etc.). (2) It decrypts browser-stored credentials using Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData) and the browser's master key. (3) It collects system and user information, including the external IP address, username, and geolocation. (4) It exfiltrates all collected data (tokens, passwords, cookies, files, zips) to a hardcoded Discord webhook (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...), which is a common C2/exfiltration method for modern malware. (5) It uses multi-threading to speed up data collection and exfiltration, and attempts to evade detection by suppressing exceptions. (6) It installs dependencies at runtime (requests, pycryptodome) to ensure it can run on any victim machine. (7) It targets a wide range of sensitive services (Coinbase, Gmail, Steam, Discord, Riot Games, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, Epic Games, Spotify, Roblox, Twitch, Minecraft, PayPal, Binance, Telegram, Netflix, etc.) by searching for related keywords in cookies and passwords. (8) It uploads stolen files to anonymous file hosting services (Anonfiles, Gofile) and sends the download links to the attacker's webhook. (9) There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for any of these actions. All of these behaviors are exclusive to malware and are never found in benign software. The code is highly obfuscated in places, uses misleading variable names, and is labeled as 'EVIL$ STEALER' in its output, further confirming its malicious intent.",
