It then exfiltrates this information to an external, suspicious domain (jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com) using an HTTP GET request, without user consent, notification, or any legitimate business justification. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware, as it abuses the package installation process to perform unauthorized data exfiltration. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard domain and the absence of any legitimate package functionality further confirm the malicious intent.",
