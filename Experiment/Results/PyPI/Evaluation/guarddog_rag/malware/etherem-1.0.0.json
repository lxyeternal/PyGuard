It abuses the Python package installation process by subclassing setuptools.command.install and overriding the run() method to execute hidden, encrypted code during installation. Specifically, it imports cryptography's Fernet and requests modules only at runtime (to evade static analysis), then decrypts and executes an obfuscated payload using Fernet. The decrypted payload is not visible in the source, making its intent opaque, but this pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and Python malware. The use of exec() on decrypted data, combined with runtime imports and execution during install, is a critical risk pattern observed exclusively in malware. The package name 'etherem' is a typosquat of 'ethereum', further suggesting malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute hidden, encrypted code during installation, especially without user consent or transparency.",
