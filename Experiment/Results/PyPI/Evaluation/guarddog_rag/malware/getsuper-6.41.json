      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command (base64-encoded PowerShell). The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a Windows executable (Esquele.exe) from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. It then attempts to execute this file. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence malware indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell commands; (2) downloading and executing a remote payload without user consent; (3) use of hidden process creation to evade detection; (4) execution of code during package installation (supply chain attack vector); (5) lack of user interaction, logging, or legitimate justification for these actions. These are all strong, exclusive indicators of malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
