      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: during package installation (in the setup.py context), it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg'. If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command using subprocess.Popen and the '-EncodedCommand' flag. The base64 string decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it to the user's Windows Startup folder as 'WindowsCache.exe', then attempts to execute it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered during installation, is obfuscated, downloads and executes a remote binary, and attempts to establish persistence by writing to the Startup folder. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
