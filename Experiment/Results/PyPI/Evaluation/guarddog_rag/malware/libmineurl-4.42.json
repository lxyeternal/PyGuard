The command is base64-encoded and obfuscated, which is a classic malware technique to evade detection. The decoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: (1) arbitrary code execution at install time, (2) obfuscated payload delivery, (3) use of a hidden process, (4) download and execution of remote code, and (5) abuse of the Python packaging ecosystem for supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script, and it is never observed in benign software.",
