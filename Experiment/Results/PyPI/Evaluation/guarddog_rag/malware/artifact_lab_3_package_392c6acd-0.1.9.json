      "malicious_behavior": "This code implements a classic reverse shell. It connects to a hardcoded external host (4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io) and port (10308), redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to the socket, and then spawns a bash shell whose I/O is fully controlled by the remote server. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine remotely, effectively granting full remote access. The use of a hardcoded, non-corporate domain, lack of user interaction or consent, and direct execution of a shell with redirected I/O are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never present in benign software.",
