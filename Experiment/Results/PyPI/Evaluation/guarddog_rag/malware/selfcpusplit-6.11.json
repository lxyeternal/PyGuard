The command is base64-encoded and obfuscated, which is a classic malware technique to evade detection. The decoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) without user consent or notification. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign Python packages. The use of a hidden process, encoded payload, and execution during installation (before any legitimate package functionality is exposed) is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malware.",
