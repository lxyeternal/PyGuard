The command is base64-encoded and obfuscated, which is a classic malware technique to evade detection. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from an external, non-standard domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory and then running it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: (1) arbitrary code execution at install time, (2) obfuscated payload delivery, (3) use of a hidden process, (4) download and execution of remote code, and (5) lack of user notification or consent. These patterns are never observed in benign software and are hallmarks of supply chain attacks and Python malware.",
