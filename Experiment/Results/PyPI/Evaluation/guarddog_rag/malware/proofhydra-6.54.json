      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py script). Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and executing potentially malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbuqmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is triggered during package installation, downloads a remote executable, and runs it without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
