      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if not present, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The encoded PowerShell command (base64) is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the payload. The command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This behavior is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where arbitrary code is executed on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of a hidden window, encoded command, and silent error suppression (broad try/except) further indicate malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
