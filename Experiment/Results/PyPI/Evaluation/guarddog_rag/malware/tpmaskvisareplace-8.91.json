      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen during the installation process (in setup.py). The PowerShell command is obfuscated and is executed only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common anti-analysis or persistence technique. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote payload from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell commands; (2) download and execution of remote code without user consent; (3) use of hidden process creation to evade detection; (4) embedding this logic in a setup script to trigger on package installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks); (5) use of a suspicious, attacker-controlled domain. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a benign package, and it is a classic pattern for Python-based malware distributed via PyPI or similar channels.",
