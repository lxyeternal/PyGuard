      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with the -EncodedCommand argument. The command is base64-encoded, which is a classic obfuscation technique used to evade detection. Decoding the base64 payload reveals that it downloads and executes a file from an external, non-transparent URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnytzbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in a setup script, runs automatically during installation, and downloads and executes a remote payload without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, and there are no legitimate reasons for such actions in a package setup script.",
