      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process of a Python package (via setup.py). The command is executed only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The use of subprocess.Popen with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a classic technique for executing obfuscated or malicious payloads on Windows systems without user consent or visibility. The base64-encoded command is likely used to download and/or execute additional code from a remote server (the encoded string contains a suspicious URL: 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0'), which is a hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign software. The presence of this logic in a setup script means it will be triggered automatically upon package installation, making it highly dangerous.",
