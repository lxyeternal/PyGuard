      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command. The encoded command is passed to PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of arbitrary code, often used in malware. The command appears to download and/or execute a payload from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgn.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior is highly indicative of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in the setup script, runs automatically during installation, and attempts to download and execute further payloads without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. All these behaviors match critical risk indicators and are never observed in benign software.",
