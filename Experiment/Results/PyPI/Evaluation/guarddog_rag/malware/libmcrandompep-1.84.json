The PowerShell command is obfuscated and is executed only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common anti-analysis or persistence technique. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest, saving it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware: (1) execution of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell commands; (2) download and execution of remote code without user consent; (3) execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector); (4) use of hidden process creation to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script, and it is a classic pattern for Python-based malware distributed via PyPI or similar channels.",
