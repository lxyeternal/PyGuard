It then immediately executes this file using os.system('start ' + filename) without any user interaction, consent, or validation. This pattern—downloading and executing a remote binary automatically during package setup or import—is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware. The code lacks any legitimate business logic, user notification, or error handling, and the use of a suspicious, hardcoded URL further increases the risk. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine and can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation.",
