      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command during the setup phase of a Python package (likely to be triggered during installation). The command uses '-EncodedCommand' to obfuscate its intent, which is a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. The encoded payload, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and attempts to run it, establishing a potential backdoor or delivering further payloads. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the check for a non-descriptive file/directory ('tahg'), and the lack of user notification or consent further confirm malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack.",
