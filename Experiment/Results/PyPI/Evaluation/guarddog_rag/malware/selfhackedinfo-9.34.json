      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if not present, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command. The encoded command is executed in a hidden window (using -WindowStyle Hidden and subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW), which is a well-known stealth technique used by malware. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This behavior is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: it executes arbitrary, obfuscated, and remotely controlled code during the installation process, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. All these behaviors are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign code.",
