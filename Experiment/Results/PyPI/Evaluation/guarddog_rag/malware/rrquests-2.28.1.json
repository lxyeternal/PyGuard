      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. Upon invocation of any HTTP method wrapper (get, post, put, patch, delete, head, options, request), the execute() function is called. This function performs the following actions: (1) It makes an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt) to retrieve a list of executables. (2) For each executable matching the current operating system, it downloads the file from the same remote server. (3) It writes the downloaded file to disk without any validation or user notification. (4) It sets executable permissions (on Linux/macOS) and immediately executes the file in the background (or uses 'start' on Windows). This is a classic 'dropper' pattern, where remote code is fetched and executed on the victim's machine without consent, integrity checks, or legitimate purpose. The use of a raw IP address, lack of user interaction, and immediate execution of remote payloads are all critical risk indicators, strongly associated with malware and never observed in benign software.",
