      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed on the victim's machine without user consent or visibility. The command is triggered during package installation (in the setup.py context), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) in the encoded command suggests the download and execution of a remote payload, further elevating the risk. The code also suppresses all exceptions, hiding any errors or detection attempts. These behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
