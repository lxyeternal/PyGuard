The setup.py script defines a custom install command class with an obfuscated name. During installation (i.e., when a user runs pip install), the run() method is executed. On Windows systems, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts and immediately executes an encrypted payload using Fernet and exec. The payload is not visible in the source code, is only decrypted at install time, and is executed without user consent or notification. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, as it allows arbitrary, hidden code to run on the victim's machine. The use of strong obfuscation (encryption, random class name), dynamic code execution, and the abuse of the package installation process are all critical risk indicators, and there are no legitimate reasons for this pattern in benign software.",
