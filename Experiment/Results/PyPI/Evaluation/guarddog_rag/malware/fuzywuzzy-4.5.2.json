      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior. 1) It collects the COMPUTERNAME environment variable (host fingerprinting) and exfiltrates it to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. 2) It downloads a Windows executable (python-install.scr) from another suspicious domain (https://python-release.com), writes it to disk as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and immediately executes it via os.system('start '+filename) without any user interaction, validation, or consent. 3) All of this is triggered automatically during package installation by hooking into setuptools' install command (PostInstallCommand), ensuring the payload runs as soon as the package is installed, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. 4) The code suppresses all exceptions, hiding any errors or detection attempts. 5) There is no legitimate business logic, documentation, or user-facing functionality to justify these actions. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
