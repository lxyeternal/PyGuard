      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command. The encoded command (base64) is passed to PowerShell with the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for executing obfuscated or hidden payloads on Windows systems. The decoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never seen in benign software.",
