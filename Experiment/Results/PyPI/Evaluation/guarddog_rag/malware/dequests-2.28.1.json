      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits several hallmarks of malicious behavior. The 'execute' function automatically runs whenever any of the HTTP methods (get, post, put, patch, delete, head, options, request) are called. It performs the following actions: (1) Contacts a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt) to retrieve a list of executables; (2) Downloads one or more executables from the same remote server, based on the local operating system; (3) Writes these executables to disk without user consent or validation; (4) Sets executable permissions (on Linux/macOS) and immediately executes the downloaded files using os.system, again without user interaction, validation, or logging. This pattern is a classic malware delivery and execution chain, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. The use of hardcoded IPs, lack of user notification, absence of error handling, and automatic execution of remote payloads are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
