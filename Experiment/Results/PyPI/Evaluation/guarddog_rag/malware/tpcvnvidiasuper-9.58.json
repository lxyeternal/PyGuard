Specifically, if the file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' flags, which is a classic technique for executing obfuscated or malicious payloads on Windows systems without user consent or visibility. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where arbitrary code is executed on the user's system during package installation. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, the obfuscated payload, and the execution of remote code all strongly indicate malicious intent.",
