It overrides the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary, obfuscated, and encrypted code during package installation, specifically on Windows systems. The custom install class imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' (from the cryptography package), then decrypts and executes a hardcoded, encrypted payload using exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden from static analysis, only runs on install, and can perform any action on the victim's machine, including data exfiltration, further malware installation, or system compromise. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and the abuse of the install hook are all strong indicators of malware. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute hidden, encrypted code during installation, especially without user consent or transparency.",
