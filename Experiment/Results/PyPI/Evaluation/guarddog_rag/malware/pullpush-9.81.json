The PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated (base64-encoded), and is run with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand', which are classic indicators of malware attempting to evade detection and execute arbitrary or malicious code on the victim's system. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed during package installation, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases the stealthiness of the attack. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute an obfuscated PowerShell command in this manner.",
