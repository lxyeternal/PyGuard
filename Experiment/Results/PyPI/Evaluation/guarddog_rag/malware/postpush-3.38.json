      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it spawns a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with the -EncodedCommand flag. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (the decoded command references a suspicious URL: http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnytzbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a textbook supply chain attack vector, as the code is placed in a setup script and will execute automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, and are never observed in benign software.",
