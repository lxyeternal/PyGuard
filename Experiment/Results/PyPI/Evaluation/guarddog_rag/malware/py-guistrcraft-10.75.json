      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a PowerShell command in hidden mode using an encoded (base64) payload. The payload is passed to PowerShell via the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious code on Windows systems. The encoded command appears to download and/or execute a file from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com), and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then likely executes them. This behavior matches multiple high-confidence malware indicators: obfuscated payload delivery, remote code execution, use of hidden PowerShell, and execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector). The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a package setup script, and it is never observed in benign software.",
