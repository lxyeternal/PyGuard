      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command during the package setup phase, specifically if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and executed with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand', which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from an external, non-transparent URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnytzbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: remote code download and execution, obfuscation via base64 encoding, execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector), lack of user consent or notification, and use of try/except to suppress errors and evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware.",
