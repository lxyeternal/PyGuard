      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the absence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not present, executes a highly obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen. The command is encoded in base64 and is run with '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a classic technique for stealthy execution of malicious payloads on Windows systems. The encoded command downloads and/or executes a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation or setup, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further increases stealth. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python packages and supply chain attacks.",
