      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior. It checks if the current user is not 'Tahg', then constructs a path in the TEMP directory for a file named 'temp-PipInstall.exe'. It then: (1) adds a registry entry to 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce' to achieve persistence by executing the downloaded file on next login; (2) downloads an executable from a suspicious Dropbox URL using curl and saves it to the constructed path; (3) immediately executes the downloaded file. All of these actions are performed without user consent, logging, or legitimate justification, and are wrapped in a try/except block that suppresses all errors, further hiding its activity. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of a suspicious URL, registry modification for persistence, and execution of a remote payload are all strong, exclusive indicators of malware.",
