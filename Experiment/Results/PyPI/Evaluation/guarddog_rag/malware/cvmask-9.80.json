      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command during package installation (in the setup.py context). Specifically, if the 'tahg' path does not exist, it runs a base64-encoded PowerShell command with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand', which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing malicious payloads on Windows systems. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This behavior is highly indicative of malware: it achieves remote code execution, payload delivery, and persistence, all without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of malicious PyPI supply chain attacks.",
