      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged code is a custom build and install script for a Python package that uses setuptools. The detected 'code-execution' patterns (e.g., self.spawn([...])) are standard subprocess invocations used for building C/C++ extensions, managing build artifacts, and copying/removing files as part of the build process. All commands are static, well-known system utilities (e.g., git, cmake, cp, rm, mkdir, tar, ls) and are scoped to the project/build directories. There is no evidence of network exfiltration, obfuscated payloads, dynamic code execution (e.g., eval/exec on untrusted data), or contact with suspicious external endpoints. The subprocess calls do not use shell=True, reducing the risk of command injection. The code does not access or transmit user data, credentials, or environment information beyond what is necessary for building the package. The use of setuptools install/build hooks is legitimate for C/C++ extension compilation. The URLs referenced are for open-source dependencies and not for downloading or executing arbitrary code. Therefore, the tool's detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of subprocess calls in a setup script, which is common in benign build systems for Python packages with native extensions.",
