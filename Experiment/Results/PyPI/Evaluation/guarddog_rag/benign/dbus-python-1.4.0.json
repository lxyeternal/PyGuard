There is no evidence of obfuscation, network communication, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or execution of arbitrary/untrusted code. All subprocess invocations use static, well-known commands and do not use shell=True, reducing the risk of command injection. The context is a setup/build script for a well-known open source project, and the commands executed are standard for compiling and installing native extensions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
