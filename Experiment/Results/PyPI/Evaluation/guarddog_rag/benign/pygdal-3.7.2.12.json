This is a standard and common pattern in Python setup scripts for C/C++ extension modules that depend on external libraries (in this case, GDAL). The command is not constructed from untrusted input, does not use shell=True, and is limited to querying configuration information from a well-known, trusted binary. There is no evidence of code injection, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or any other suspicious or malicious behavior. The code is part of a legitimate build process for Python bindings to GDAL, a widely used geospatial library. The use of subprocess here is transparent, controlled, and consistent with benign, open-source package setup scripts.",
