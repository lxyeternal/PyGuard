      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command (Install) that is executed automatically during package installation via the cmdclass argument in setup(). In the Install.run() method, it decodes a base64-encoded domain ('d3d3LmRsMDEucHduei5vcmc=' → 'www.dl01.pwnz.org'), resolves its IP address using socket.gethostbyname, and then calls a method (self.tesy) with the resolved IP. Although the tesy method is likely a typo for 'test' and only prints 'Testing!', the presence of a custom install hook, obfuscated (base64-encoded) external domain, and network resolution during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, where code is executed on the user's system during package installation, potentially enabling data exfiltration, remote code execution, or further payload delivery. The use of an external, non-corporate, and suspicious domain further elevates the risk. Even though the current payload is inert, the infrastructure and obfuscation are consistent with known malware techniques.",
