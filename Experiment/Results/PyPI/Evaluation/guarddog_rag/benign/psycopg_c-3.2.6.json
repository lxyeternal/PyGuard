This is a standard and benign pattern in Python packages that build C extensions against PostgreSQL (such as psycopg2/psycopg3). The command is not constructed from untrusted or user-supplied input, does not use shell=True, and does not perform any network operations, code execution, or data exfiltration. The subprocess output is only used to configure build paths for C extensions. This pattern is common in legitimate setup.py scripts for database adapters and does not match any of the critical or high-risk malicious behaviors described above.",
