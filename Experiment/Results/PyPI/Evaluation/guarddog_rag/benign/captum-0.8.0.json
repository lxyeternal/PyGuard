      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line (subprocess.check_call(command)) is used in the context of a setup.py script for the open-source Captum library. The command being executed is a static, project-local shell script ('./scripts/build_insights.sh'), which is only run if the BUILD_INSIGHTS environment variable is set. There is no evidence of obfuscation, dynamic or remote code execution, data exfiltration, or any other suspicious behavior. The subprocess call does not use shell=True, reducing the risk of command injection. The code is transparent, well-documented, and consistent with standard build processes in Python projects that require building frontend assets. Therefore, this is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of subprocess usage in a setup script, which can be risky in some contexts but is justified and safe here.",
