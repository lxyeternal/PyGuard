Its purpose is to send progress bar updates to a Discord channel using a bot, which requires legitimate use of the Discord API endpoint (https://discord.com/api/v10). The code does not collect or exfiltrate sensitive user data, execute arbitrary code, or perform any obfuscated or suspicious operations. All network communication is limited to sending progress updates to a user-specified Discord channel via a bot token, which is a documented and expected use case. The presence of the Discord API URL is not inherently malicious; it is required for the intended functionality. There is no evidence of privilege escalation, code injection, or data exfiltration beyond the explicit, user-controlled progress updates. The code is well-documented, transparent, and consistent with legitimate application logic.",

Its purpose is to send progress updates to a user-specified Telegram chat via a bot, using the official Telegram Bot API endpoint (https://api.telegram.org/bot). The code does not contain any obfuscation, code execution, privilege escalation, credential collection, or exfiltration of sensitive data. All network communication is limited to sending progress messages to Telegram, as configured by the user (with explicit token and chat_id). The use of the Telegram API is well-documented, and the endpoints are standard for this legitimate use case. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data theft, or abuse of the user's environment. The detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of a hardcoded external API endpoint, which in this context is benign and expected.",
