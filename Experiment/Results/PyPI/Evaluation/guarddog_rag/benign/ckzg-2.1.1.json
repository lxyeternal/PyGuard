      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines use subprocess.check_call to execute build scripts (a Windows batch file and a 'make' command) as part of a setuptools build_ext customization. This is a common and legitimate pattern in Python packages that include native extensions or require compilation of C/C++ code. The commands are static, do not involve network access, do not execute arbitrary or downloaded code, and are limited to building project dependencies. There is no evidence of obfuscation, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or other suspicious behaviors. The code is transparent, well-structured, and consistent with open-source build processes. The detection is a false positive due to the generic flagging of shell command execution in setup scripts, which, while risky in some contexts, is benign and necessary here for building native extensions.",
