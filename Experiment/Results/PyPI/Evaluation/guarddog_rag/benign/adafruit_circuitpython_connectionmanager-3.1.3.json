The flagged line (a dictionary entry with {\"host\": \"discord.com\"}) is part of a static list of well-known API and service hosts, used for connectivity or SSL validation tests. There is no code that sends data to, retrieves data from, or otherwise interacts with discord.com or any other host in a suspicious manner. The code does not perform any of the following: exfiltration of data, execution of remote code, privilege escalation, obfuscation, or any other typical malicious behaviors. All network operations are limited to connection attempts for the purpose of testing SSL/TLS connectivity and are not used for data exfiltration or command-and-control. The presence of 'discord.com' in a static host list is not, by itself, an indicator of malicious activity, especially in the context of a connectivity test suite. No evidence of code execution, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. This is a clear false positive.",
