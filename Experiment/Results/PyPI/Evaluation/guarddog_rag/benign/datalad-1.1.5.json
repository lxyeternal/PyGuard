The flagged line (oldprint = getattr(builtins, 'print')) is not malicious; it is used to save a reference to the original print function so that it can be restored after being temporarily overridden within a context manager (swallow_outputs). This is a common and benign pattern in Python for redirecting or capturing output, especially in testing or logging scenarios. There is no evidence of obfuscation, code injection, network communication, privilege escalation, or any other malicious behavior. The code is well-documented, transparent, and does not match any of the high-risk or critical risk indicators for malware. The security tool's detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the use of getattr on builtins, which is a benign and common practice in advanced Python code.",
