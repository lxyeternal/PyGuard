The endpoint is dynamically constructed to point to the official AWS Cognito service (https://cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/), and the data being sent is required for device confirmation and management as part of the Cognito SRP authentication protocol. There is no evidence of exfiltration to attacker-controlled or suspicious domains, no obfuscation, no credential theft, and no execution of arbitrary code. The use of requests.post here is consistent with standard SDK or authentication library behavior, and all network communication is with AWS infrastructure. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
