There are no network requests, code execution, file system manipulation, or any of the typical indicators of malicious behavior. All external URLs are related to documentation, project repositories, or legitimate feedback channels. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or exfiltration is present. The flagged domain is the official site for the Sphinx Awesome Theme, matching the project context. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
