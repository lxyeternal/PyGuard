      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged subprocess and code execution patterns are present in the context of a setup/build script for a well-known cryptography library (M2Crypto). The subprocess calls are used to: (1) query the macOS SDK path, (2) invoke the C preprocessor to discover include directories, and (3) preprocess OpenSSL header files to generate SWIG interface code. All commands are static, do not use shell=True, do not involve network communication, do not execute arbitrary or downloaded code, and are consistent with standard build/compilation workflows. There is no evidence of obfuscation, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or code injection. The subprocess usage is transparent, logged, and limited to legitimate build-time operations. Therefore, the tool's detection is a false positive due to the presence of subprocess usage in a setup script, which is common and benign in this context.",
