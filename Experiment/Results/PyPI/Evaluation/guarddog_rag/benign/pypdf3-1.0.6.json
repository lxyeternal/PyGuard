      "false_positive_reason": "The code in question is a utility module for a PDF library (likely PyPDF2 or a derivative), providing compatibility functions for Python 2 and 3, type checking, and some basic cryptographic and stream utilities. The lines flagged by the security tool (use of getattr on builtins for 'xrange', 'basestring', and 'unicode') are standard compatibility patterns for supporting both Python 2 and 3, not obfuscation for malicious purposes. There are no signs of network communication, code execution, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or any of the critical or high-risk behaviors associated with malware. The code is well-documented, transparent, and consistent with benign open-source library practices. The flagged lines are false positives due to their superficial similarity to obfuscation patterns, but in this context, they are legitimate and widely used in cross-version Python code.",
