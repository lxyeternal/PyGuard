      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged code (use of subprocess.run to invoke pkg-config and capture its output) is a standard, benign pattern in Python build and setup scripts, especially for scientific or C-extension packages. The subprocess call is used to query system configuration for library paths and flags, not to execute arbitrary or user-supplied code. There is no evidence of obfuscation, remote code execution, network exfiltration, or any of the typical malware behaviors described above. The command arguments are constructed from static, trusted sources (package/library names and flags), and there is no use of shell=True or dynamic code execution. The context is a setup/build script for a well-known scientific package (likely PyTables or similar), and all subprocess usage is transparent and justified. Therefore, the security tool's detection is a false positive.",
