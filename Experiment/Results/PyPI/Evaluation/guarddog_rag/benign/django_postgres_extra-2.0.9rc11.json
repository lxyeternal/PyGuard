The commands are statically defined, not constructed from untrusted or external input, and do not involve network access, obfuscated payloads, or code execution from remote sources. There is no evidence of privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or persistence mechanisms. The use of subprocess here is a common, benign pattern in Python package setup scripts to automate linting, formatting, and testing. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are present.",
