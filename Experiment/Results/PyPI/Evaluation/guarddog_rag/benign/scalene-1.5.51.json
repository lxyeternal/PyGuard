      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged code is a typical setup.py script for a Python package that builds C++ extensions and manages platform-specific build steps. The use of subprocess.run and self.spawn is limited to compiling code (e.g., running make or a compiler) and does not involve shell=True, dynamic code execution, or network communication. There are no signs of obfuscation, data exfiltration, remote code download, or execution of arbitrary code. All subprocess calls are for legitimate build operations, and no sensitive data is accessed or transmitted. The use of custom setuptools commands (cmdclass) is standard for packages with compiled extensions. No evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack patterns is present.",
