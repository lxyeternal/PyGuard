      "false_positive_reason": "The code provided is a standard setup.py script for a Python package. It uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and custom build/develop commands. The only subprocess usage is in the pip_install function, which is not invoked anywhere in the script. There are no suspicious network operations, no obfuscated or encoded payloads, no use of exec/eval, no data exfiltration, and no shell=True subprocess calls. All file operations are related to reading version and requirements files, which is typical for Python packaging. The setup() call on line 74 is standard and does not overwrite or execute arbitrary code. The detection is likely a false positive due to the presence of a setup() call in a packaging script, which is a common and benign pattern.",
