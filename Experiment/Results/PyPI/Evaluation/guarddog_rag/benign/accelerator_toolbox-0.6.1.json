      "false_positive_reason": "The code in question is a setup.py script for building Python C/C++ extensions, commonly found in scientific or numerical computing packages. The flagged lines use eval(os.environ.get('MPI', 'None')) and eval(os.environ.get('OPENMP', 'None')) to interpret environment variables as Python expressions, which is generally discouraged due to potential security risks if untrusted input is provided. However, in this context, the environment variables are expected to be set by the user or build system to simple values like 'True', 'False', or 'None', controlling whether MPI or OpenMP support is enabled. There is no evidence of code injection, remote code execution, network communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The use of eval here is not ideal, but it is not being used to execute arbitrary or attacker-controlled code, and there are no other suspicious behaviors present. This is a common (if slightly unsafe) pattern in benign build scripts, not a hallmark of malware.",
