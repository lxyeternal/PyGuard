This IP address is the well-known Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun) ECS instance metadata service, which is used by cloud SDKs to retrieve temporary security credentials for the instance's assigned RAM role. The code is part of a class (EcsRamRoleSigner) that inherits from a Signer base class, and is used to refresh and manage session credentials for authenticated API requests. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, code execution, or other malicious behaviors. The use of a hardcoded IP is standard for cloud metadata services, and the code is consistent with legitimate SDK credential management patterns. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
