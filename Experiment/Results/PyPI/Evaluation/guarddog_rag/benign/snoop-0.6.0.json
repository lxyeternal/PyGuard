      "false_positive_reason": "The code in question is part of a debugging/logging utility, likely from the 'snoop' Python package, which provides advanced tracing and pretty-printing of expressions. The flagged line (and getattr(builtins, node.id, object()) == value) is used in the context of AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) analysis to determine if a node represents a built-in name and if its value matches the runtime value. This is a legitimate technique for introspection and debugging, not for obfuscation or malicious activity. There are no signs of code execution, network communication, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or any other typical malicious behaviors. The code does not use eval/exec on untrusted data, does not manipulate the file system or environment in suspicious ways, and does not contact external servers. The use of getattr on builtins is a standard Python idiom for safe attribute access and is not inherently suspicious. The detection is a false positive, likely triggered by a generic pattern-matching rule that does not account for the benign context of AST analysis in debugging tools.",
