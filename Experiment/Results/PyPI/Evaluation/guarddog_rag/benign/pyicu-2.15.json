      "false_positive_reason": "The code in question is a setup/build script for the PyICU Python package, which is a well-known open-source library for ICU (International Components for Unicode) bindings. The flagged lines involve the use of subprocess (check_output) to invoke system utilities such as 'icu-config' and 'pkg-config' to detect and configure build flags for compiling the C++ extension. These subprocess calls are static, transparent, and only interact with standard system utilities required for building the extension. There is no evidence of obfuscation, network communication, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or execution of arbitrary/untrusted code. The subprocess usage is limited to querying system configuration, which is a common and benign pattern in setup scripts for native extensions. No suspicious endpoints, payloads, or install hooks are present. Therefore, the tool's detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the generic presence of subprocess calls, which in this context are safe and expected.",
