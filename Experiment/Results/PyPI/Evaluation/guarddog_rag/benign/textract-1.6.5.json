The only reference to an external URL is in a help string for the --option argument, which points to 'http://bit.ly/textract-options' to provide users with documentation about available options. There are no network operations, no code execution from remote sources, no obfuscation, no exfiltration, and no suspicious API usage. The code is transparent, well-documented, and uses standard libraries and patterns. The flagged 'shady-links' detection is a false positive, as the URL is only present in a help message and not used programmatically. This is a common and benign pattern in open-source CLI tools.",
