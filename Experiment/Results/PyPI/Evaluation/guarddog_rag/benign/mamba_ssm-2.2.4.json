      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged subprocess.check_output calls are used to query the version of CUDA (nvcc -V) and HIP (hipcc --version) compilers, which is standard practice in Python packages that build native extensions for GPU support. The commands are static, do not use shell=True, do not execute arbitrary or user-supplied code, and are not used to download, execute, or exfiltrate data. There is no evidence of obfuscation, privilege escalation, code injection, or network exfiltration. The subprocess usage is transparent, limited to environment detection, and is consistent with benign, open-source build scripts. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
