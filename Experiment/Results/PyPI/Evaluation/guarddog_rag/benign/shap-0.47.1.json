This is a common and legitimate pattern in scientific and machine learning libraries that provide GPU acceleration. The command is constructed from static, project-related arguments and does not involve user input, network access, or obfuscated payloads. There is no evidence of privilege escalation, code injection, data exfiltration, or any other suspicious behavior. The subprocess call does not use shell=True, reducing the risk of command injection. The context is a setup/build script for a well-known library (SHAP), and all operations are transparent and consistent with standard build workflows. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
