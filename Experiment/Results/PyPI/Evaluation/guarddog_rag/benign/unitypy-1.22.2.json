This is a common and benign pattern in Python packaging to adapt build flags based on the detected compiler version. The command is static, does not use shell=True, does not execute arbitrary or user-supplied code, and does not contact external servers or exfiltrate data. There is no evidence of obfuscation, privilege escalation, or suspicious network/file operations. The subprocess call is strictly for environment detection and is a standard practice in legitimate build scripts. Therefore, the tool's detection is a false positive.",
