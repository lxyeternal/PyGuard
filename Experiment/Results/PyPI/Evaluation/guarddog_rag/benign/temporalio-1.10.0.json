      "false_positive_reason": "The code in question is part of a restrictive importer for a workflow sandbox, designed to control and restrict module imports and access to built-in functions in a controlled environment. The flagged line (ret = _ThreadLocalCallable(getattr(builtins, name))) is not obfuscation for malicious purposes, but rather a mechanism to wrap built-in functions in a thread-local callable for safe, sandboxed execution. There is no evidence of network communication, code execution from untrusted sources, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or any of the typical malicious behaviors described. The code is well-documented, uses standard library modules, and is consistent with legitimate sandboxing and security practices. The use of getattr and dynamic function wrapping is for enforcing restrictions, not for evasion or payload delivery. Therefore, the tool's detection is a false positive.",
