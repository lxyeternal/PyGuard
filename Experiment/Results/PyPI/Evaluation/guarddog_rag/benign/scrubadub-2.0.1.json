The only external URL present ('http://bit.ly/unipain @nedbat') is included as a humorous reference in an error message string, not as an endpoint for network communication or data exfiltration. There are no network operations, no code execution, no file system manipulation, no obfuscation, and no evidence of any malicious behavior. The flagged line is a benign informational message, not an indicator of malware. This is a clear false positive, likely triggered by the presence of a shortened URL in a string literal.",
