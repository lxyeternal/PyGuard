      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line uses subprocess.check_call to invoke the Go compiler ('go build') to build a C-shared library as part of a setuptools build_ext hook. This is a common and legitimate pattern for Python packages that wrap Go code as native extensions. The command is static, does not use shell=True, does not download or execute remote code, and does not manipulate user/system data or exfiltrate information. The context is a build process for a well-known open-source package ('tdewolff-minify'), and the subprocess call is only used to compile code, not to execute arbitrary or untrusted commands. There is no evidence of obfuscation, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or other malicious behaviors. The use of subprocess in this context is benign and expected for building native extensions.",
