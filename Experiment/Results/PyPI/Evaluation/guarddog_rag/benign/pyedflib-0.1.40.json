The subprocess call is used to retrieve the current git commit hash for versioning purposes, and it does not use shell=True, nor does it execute arbitrary or untrusted code. There is no evidence of network exfiltration, obfuscated payloads, dynamic code execution, or any of the high-risk behaviors associated with Python malware or supply chain attacks. All subprocess and file operations are limited to legitimate build, versioning, and packaging tasks. The code structure, documentation, and context are consistent with benign, open-source package management practices.",
