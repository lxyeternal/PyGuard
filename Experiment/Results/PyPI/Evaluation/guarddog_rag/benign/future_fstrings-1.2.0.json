      "malicious_behavior": "This code abuses the setuptools install hook to inject a .pth file containing Python code that is executed automatically on interpreter startup. Specifically, it creates a .pth file with the contents 'import sys; exec(...)', where the executed code attempts to import and register the 'future_fstrings' module. The use of 'exec' in a .pth file is a well-known supply chain attack vector, as it enables arbitrary code execution on every Python startup for any user who installs this package. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and is never observed in benign software. Even though the payload here appears to only register 'future_fstrings', the mechanism allows for arbitrary code execution and could be trivially modified to perform malicious actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or persistence. The use of a custom install class to manipulate .pth files and inject code is a hallmark of Python package malware.",
