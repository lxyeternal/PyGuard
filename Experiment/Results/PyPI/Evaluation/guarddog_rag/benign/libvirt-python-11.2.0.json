      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines use subprocess.check_output to run local commands (e.g., pkg-config, git) and capture their output. These commands are used to gather build information, generate documentation, and collect author/changelog data for packaging purposes. There is no evidence of network exfiltration, remote code execution, obfuscation, or use of untrusted input in command construction. All subprocess calls use static, well-known commands relevant to the build process, and do not use shell=True (which would increase risk). The code is consistent with standard, transparent build and packaging scripts for Python C extensions, and does not exhibit any of the high-risk or critical-risk behaviors associated with malware or supply chain attacks.",
