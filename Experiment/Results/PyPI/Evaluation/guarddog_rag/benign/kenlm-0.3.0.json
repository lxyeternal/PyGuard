This is a common and legitimate pattern in build scripts, especially those using setuptools to build C/C++ extensions. The command is constructed from static, hardcoded values (header and library names), and there is no evidence of obfuscation, network communication, data exfiltration, or execution of arbitrary/untrusted code. The use of os.system here is limited to build-time checks and does not present a security risk in this context. The rest of the script is a standard setup.py for building a Python extension module (kenlm), with no suspicious or malicious behaviors present.",
