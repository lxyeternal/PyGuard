      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines (os.system('pip install .') and subprocess.check_output(cmd)) are used in the context of a setup.py script for a Python package. Their usage is limited to ensuring proper installation of dependencies and handling local package installation, particularly in environments like ReadTheDocs or when handling starred dependencies. There is no evidence of obfuscated code, remote code execution, data exfiltration, or any network communication to untrusted endpoints. The subprocess and os.system calls are not constructed from untrusted input, do not use shell=True, and are not used to execute arbitrary or downloaded code. The code is transparent, well-documented, and follows patterns seen in legitimate package management scripts. Therefore, the tool's detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of process execution APIs in a setup script, which in this context is benign.",
