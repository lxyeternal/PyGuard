The commands are static, do not use shell=True, do not execute arbitrary or user-supplied code, and do not contact external or suspicious domains. There is no evidence of obfuscation, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or payload delivery. All subprocess calls are for legitimate build environment detection and configuration, which is common in open-source Python packages that compile C extensions. No other indicators of compromise or malicious intent are present.",
