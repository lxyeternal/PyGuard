      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line (output = subprocess.check_output('make', shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)) appears in the context of a custom setuptools command (BDDTestCommand) that is only executed when explicitly invoked (e.g., via 'python setup.py bddtest'). The command runs 'make' in firmware test directories as part of a test/build process, which is a standard and expected operation in many Python projects that interface with native code or embedded systems. The use of shell=True does increase the risk of command injection if untrusted input is used, but in this code, the command is static ('make') and not constructed from user or external input. There is no evidence of obfuscation, data exfiltration, network communication, credential theft, or other malicious behaviors. The code is well-documented, open source, and follows standard patterns for build/test automation. Therefore, this is a false positive due to the legitimate use of subprocess with shell=True in a controlled, non-automatic context.",
