      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line sends a POST request to an API endpoint ('/api/v1/assets/upload') with project files and metadata, including a thumbnail, to a user-supplied URL. The code reads files from a specified directory, encodes them in base64, and uploads them as part of a deployment process. The endpoint, headers, and payload structure are consistent with legitimate deployment or asset upload workflows (e.g., for a cloud service or web application). The use of an API key from an environment variable (HAL9_TOKEN) and the lack of obfuscation, privilege escalation, or suspicious endpoints further support benign intent. There is no evidence of credential theft, code execution, or exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure. The code does not run automatically on install, nor does it access sensitive system/user files outside the project directory. The detection is likely a false positive due to the generic pattern of file enumeration and HTTP POST, which can be used for both benign and malicious purposes, but in this context is clearly part of a legitimate deployment workflow.",
