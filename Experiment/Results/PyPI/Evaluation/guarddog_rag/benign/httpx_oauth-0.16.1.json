      "false_positive_reason": "The code implements a standard OAuth2 client for Discord, using well-known and documented Discord API endpoints (authorize, token, revoke, profile). These endpoints are not suspicious or attacker-controlled; they are the official endpoints for Discord's OAuth2 flow. The code does not perform any obfuscated operations, does not execute code from remote sources, does not exfiltrate data to untrusted domains, and does not manipulate the file system or execute shell commands. All network communication is consistent with legitimate OAuth2 authentication and user profile retrieval. The flagged lines are only hardcoded references to Discord's public API, which is expected in an OAuth2 client. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation. The security tool likely flagged the code due to the presence of hardcoded external URLs, but in this context, they are legitimate and necessary for the application's function.",
