This pattern is common in Python packaging to provide a 'clean' command that removes build artifacts and temporary files generated during packaging and installation. The command only deletes project-specific build and cache directories/files, does not access sensitive system locations, does not execute arbitrary or remote code, does not exfiltrate data, and is not obfuscated. There is no evidence of privilege escalation, code injection, or network activity. This usage is well-documented and widely accepted in open-source Python projects. Therefore, the security tool's detection is a false positive.",
