      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged code uses subprocess.Popen to execute '/usr/bin/xcodebuild -version' on macOS systems, capturing its output. This is a standard, transparent check to determine the installed Xcode version, which is relevant for build configuration in Python packages with native extensions. The command is static, does not use shell=True, does not process untrusted input, and does not contact external servers or exfiltrate data. The result is used only to set an environment variable (ARCHFLAGS) for build compatibility. There is no evidence of privilege escalation, code injection, obfuscation, data exfiltration, or other malicious behaviors. This pattern is common in legitimate setup scripts for cross-platform Python packages that need to adapt to different build environments. The detection is a false positive due to the presence of subprocess usage in a setup script, but the context and implementation are benign.",
