The command is static, does not use shell=True, does not execute arbitrary or user-supplied code, and does not contact external servers or exfiltrate data. The subprocess call is used solely to retrieve build configuration information, not to perform code execution or system manipulation. The rest of the setup script is standard for Python packages with C++ extensions. There are no signs of obfuscation, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or other malicious behaviors. This is a common pattern in benign, open-source Python projects that use pybind11.",
