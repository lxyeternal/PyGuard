There is no evidence of data exfiltration, network communication, code execution, privilege escalation, obfuscation, or any other suspicious or malicious behavior. Clipboard access alone is not inherently malicious, especially when it is clearly documented, used in a utility context, and not combined with data exfiltration or process injection. The code is well-documented, transparent, and does not interact with external servers or perform any hidden actions. The security tool likely flagged this due to the use of clipboard access APIs, which can be abused in malware, but in this context, the usage is legitimate and benign.",

The use of pyperclip to read from and write to the clipboard is clearly documented, and all clipboard operations are performed in the context of user-driven automation tasks (e.g., copying from or pasting to UI elements). There is no evidence of data exfiltration, network communication, code execution, privilege escalation, or obfuscation. The code is well-structured, documented, and does not perform any suspicious or hidden actions. Clipboard access alone is not inherently malicious; it is a common requirement in automation and RPA tools. The security tool's detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of clipboard access APIs, which are sometimes abused in malware but are also widely used in legitimate automation and testing software.",
