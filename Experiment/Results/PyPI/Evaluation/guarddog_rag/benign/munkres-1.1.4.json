The command being executed is a static, well-known documentation generator (pdoc) with no dynamic or untrusted input. There is no evidence of obfuscation, network exfiltration, privilege escalation, or execution of arbitrary/untrusted code. The use of os.system in this context is a common, benign pattern in setup scripts for building documentation. The rest of the code is standard for a setup.py file, with no suspicious imports, payloads, or install-time execution hooks. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
