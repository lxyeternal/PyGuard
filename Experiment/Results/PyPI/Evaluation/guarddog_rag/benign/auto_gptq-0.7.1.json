      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines involve subprocess execution during the build process in a setup.py script for a Python package (auto_gptq). Specifically, the code uses subprocess to (1) query CPU core information via 'cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep cores | head -1' and (2) run a local Python script ('./autogptq_extension/qigen/generate.py') to generate kernels for the package. These actions are typical for packages that need to compile native extensions or optimize builds based on the host system. There is no evidence of network communication, data exfiltration, obfuscated payloads, or execution of remote/untrusted code. The subprocess calls are limited to local system introspection and local script execution, which are common and expected in build scripts for performance-oriented Python packages. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present according to the provided knowledge points.",
