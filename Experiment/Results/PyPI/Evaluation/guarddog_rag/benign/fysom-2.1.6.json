The run method only calls these empty methods before and after the standard install process. There are no suspicious imports, no network operations, no file system manipulation, no obfuscation, no code execution, and no exfiltration of data. The setup() call is standard for Python packages. While subclassing setuptools.command.install and using install hooks can be abused for malicious purposes, in this case, there is no actual malicious payload or behavior present. The detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of a custom install class, which is not inherently malicious without further suspicious actions.",
