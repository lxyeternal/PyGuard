This is a common and legitimate pattern in Python packages that use Cython for performance. The subprocess call does not use shell=True (which would increase risk), and the command arguments are constructed from static, project-local variables, not from untrusted or external input. There is no evidence of code execution from remote sources, data exfiltration, obfuscation, or other malicious behaviors. The code is consistent with standard package build scripts and does not perform any suspicious actions outside of the expected build process.",
