      "false_positive_reason": "The code in question is part of a template and AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) manipulation utility, likely from a templating engine or code generation library (e.g., Chameleon). The flagged line (getattr(builtins, node.id, None) is not None) is used to check if a given identifier corresponds to a Python built-in, which is a common and benign pattern in code that manipulates or analyzes Python ASTs. There is no evidence of network communication, code execution from untrusted sources, file system manipulation, data exfiltration, or any of the critical or high-risk behaviors associated with malware. The use of getattr on builtins is not, by itself, an indicator of obfuscation or maliciousness in this context; it is a standard way to check for built-in names. The rest of the code is focused on AST transformation, code generation, and symbol management, with no suspicious or dangerous operations. Therefore, the tool's detection is a false positive, likely triggered by a generic obfuscation heuristic that does not apply in this legitimate context.",
