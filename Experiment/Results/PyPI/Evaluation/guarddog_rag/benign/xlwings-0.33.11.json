      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged code (clipboard.copy(text)) is used in the context of a legitimate 'copy' command, which copies the contents of a local file (such as a VBA module or script) to the user's clipboard. The code only accesses the clipboard after explicit user action (e.g., running 'xlwings copy vba'), and the data copied is not exfiltrated or sent to any external server. There is no evidence of clipboard monitoring, hijacking, or stealthy data exfiltration. The code does not perform any suspicious network operations, code execution, or privilege escalation. Clipboard access in this context is a standard feature for developer tools and is accompanied by user notification ('Successfully copied to clipboard.'). Therefore, the security tool's detection is a false positive, as the clipboard access is both transparent and user-initiated, with no malicious intent or behavior.",
