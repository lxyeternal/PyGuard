This pattern is used here to resolve variable names by looking them up in the built-in namespace if they are not found in the local variable mapping. This is a common and legitimate technique in AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) processing and code analysis tools to evaluate or reconstruct expressions that may reference built-in Python functions or constants (e.g., 'len', 'all', 'None'). There is no evidence of code execution via exec/eval, no network or file system access, no obfuscation, and no suspicious or privileged operations. The code is well-documented, appears to be part of a library for analyzing or recomputing Python expressions, and does not match any of the high-risk or critical-risk malware patterns described above. The use of getattr on builtins is transparent and contextually justified for AST evaluation, not for obfuscation or evasion.",
