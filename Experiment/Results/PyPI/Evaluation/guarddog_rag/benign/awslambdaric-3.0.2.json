      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines involve the use of subprocess.check_call and subprocess.check_output to execute a local shell script (./scripts/preinstall.sh) and to invoke a local binary (./deps/artifacts/bin/curl-config) for build configuration. These actions are performed as part of a build process for a native extension in a setup.py script, which is a common and legitimate pattern in many open-source Python projects, especially those that need to compile C/C++ extensions or manage native dependencies. There is no evidence of network communication, code obfuscation, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or execution of remote/untrusted code. The commands are static, local, and related to the build process. The code is from a well-known, reputable open-source project (AWS Lambda Runtime Interface Client). Therefore, the tool's detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the generic pattern of shell command execution in setup scripts, which, while risky in some contexts, is benign and expected here.",
