      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines use os.system to invoke the 'black' code formatter as part of a custom setuptools command (FormatCommand) in setup.py. This is a common and benign pattern in Python projects to provide code formatting or linting commands via setup.py. The commands are static, do not involve network access, do not execute arbitrary or user-supplied code, and are not triggered automatically during installation—they are only run if the user explicitly invokes 'python setup.py format' or similar. There is no evidence of obfuscation, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code. The use of os.system here is transparent and limited to a well-known developer tool, matching benign patterns in open-source projects.",
