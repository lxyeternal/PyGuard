      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line (with urllib.request.urlopen(url, context=context) as response:) is part of a function (download) that downloads a file from a given URL and saves it to a specified destination on disk. This is a common pattern in package management, build tools, and legitimate software that needs to fetch resources (e.g., dependencies, binaries, configuration files) from remote servers. The code does not exfiltrate local or sensitive data, does not send any information to the remote server, and does not execute or process the downloaded data in a suspicious way (e.g., via exec, eval, or shell execution). The URL is provided as a parameter, and there is no evidence of hardcoded, suspicious, or attacker-controlled endpoints. There is also proper error handling and retry logic. The context of the code (build utilities, resource management) and the absence of any obfuscation, exfiltration, or code execution on downloaded content further support that this is benign. The security tool likely produced a false positive by flagging any use of urllib.request.urlopen as potentially exfiltrating, but in this context, it is only used for legitimate file download.",
