      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines use os.popen with curl to query public IP address services (ifconfig.me, ipinfo.io, myip.dnsomatic.com) in order to determine the machine's external IP address. This is a common and benign pattern in networking utilities and is not used here for data exfiltration, code execution, or persistence. The endpoints are well-known public IP-checking services, not attacker-controlled or suspicious domains. The code does not collect or transmit sensitive user data, nor does it execute or download arbitrary code. There is no evidence of obfuscation, privilege escalation, or other typical malware behaviors. The use of os.popen for curl could be replaced with a more secure method (e.g., using requests or urllib), but in this context, it is not inherently malicious. The code is transparent, well-documented, and its intent is clear and legitimate.",
