      "false_positive_reason": "The code defines a CustomInstall class that overrides the setuptools install command, but the only action performed in the run() method is printing 'hello world'. All potentially suspicious code (collecting hostname, username, and sending them via requests to an external URL) is commented out and therefore not executed. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, code execution, or any other malicious behavior in the active code. The use of cmdclass to override install is a common and benign pattern in Python packaging, provided the overridden method does not perform harmful actions. In this case, the override is harmless. The security tool likely flagged this due to the presence of the commented-out suspicious code and the use of cmdclass, but as written, the code is not malicious.",
