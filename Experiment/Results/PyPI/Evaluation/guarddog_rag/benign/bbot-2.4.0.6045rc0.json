      "false_positive_reason": "The code is a Python client implementation for interact.sh, an open-source tool used for out-of-band (OOB) interaction detection, commonly used in security testing and vulnerability research. The flagged line (server_list = [\"oast.pro\", ...]) contains a list of interact.sh public servers, which are legitimate endpoints for this service. The code does not perform any of the following: arbitrary code execution, exfiltration of local sensitive data, privilege escalation, or obfuscated payload delivery. All network communication is consistent with the documented purpose of interact.sh (registering, polling, and deregistering for OOB events). There is no evidence of credential theft, system manipulation, or hidden persistence mechanisms. The code is well-documented, transparent, and does not match any of the critical or high-risk malware patterns described above. The detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of non-standard domains, but these are legitimate for the context of interact.sh.",
