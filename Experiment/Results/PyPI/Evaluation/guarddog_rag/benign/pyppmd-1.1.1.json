      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged code customizes the setuptools setup() call by providing a custom cmdclass for build_ext and egg_info, which is a common and benign pattern in Python packages that build C extensions. The custom build_ext_compiler_check class only adjusts compiler flags (e.g., -Werror, /WX) based on user options and platform, and the my_egg_info class works around a known setuptools issue by removing a build artifact file (SOURCES.txt) before proceeding. There are no signs of code execution, network communication, obfuscation, data exfiltration, or other suspicious behaviors. All file and directory operations are limited to build artifacts and project directories. The code does not match any of the high-risk or critical-risk patterns associated with malware or supply chain attacks. The security tool likely flagged this due to the override of cmdclass in setup(), but this is a standard and well-documented practice in Python packaging for legitimate build customization.",
