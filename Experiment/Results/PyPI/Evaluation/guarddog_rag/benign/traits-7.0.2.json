This is a common and benign pattern in open-source Python projects that use Git for versioning. The subprocess call does not use shell=True (which would increase risk), and the arguments are statically defined within the code (not user-controlled or obfuscated). There is no evidence of network exfiltration, code injection, privilege escalation, or execution of arbitrary/untrusted code. The context is a setup script for a well-known open-source package (Enthought Traits), and all subprocess usage is transparent, documented, and limited to version control operations. No suspicious endpoints, obfuscation, or data exfiltration is present. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
