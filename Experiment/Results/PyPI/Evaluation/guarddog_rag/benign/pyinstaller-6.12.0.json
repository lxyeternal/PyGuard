The subprocess call is used to compile the bootloader component by invoking a local build script (./waf configure all) within the project's own directory. The command is static, does not use shell=True, does not download or execute remote code, and does not exfiltrate data or perform any obfuscated or suspicious actions. This pattern is common and benign in legitimate build systems that require native code compilation. There is no evidence of privilege escalation, code injection, data exfiltration, or other malicious behaviors. The code is transparent, well-documented, and consistent with standard open-source project practices.",
