      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines use os.popen to execute 'odbc_config' commands in order to retrieve compiler and linker flags for building a Python C extension (pyodbc). This is a common and legitimate pattern in setup scripts for Python packages that need to interface with system libraries (in this case, ODBC). The commands are static, do not involve user or network input, do not exfiltrate data, do not download or execute remote code, and are not obfuscated. There is no evidence of privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or code injection. The context is a well-known open-source package (pyodbc), and the shell commands are standard for build configuration. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
