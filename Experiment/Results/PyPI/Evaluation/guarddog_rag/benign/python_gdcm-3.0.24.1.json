      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged subprocess calls (subprocess.run, subprocess.check_call) are used in the context of building and configuring native Python extensions with CMake, SWIG, and platform-specific tools (patchelf, install_name_tool). These are standard operations for Python packages that need to compile C/C++ code and adjust shared library dependencies for portability. There is no evidence of obfuscation, network communication, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or execution of arbitrary/untrusted code. All subprocess invocations use static, well-known build tools and arguments, and do not use shell=True (which would increase risk). The code is consistent with legitimate build logic for a Python package with native extensions, and does not match any of the critical or high-risk malware patterns described above.",
