      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged code (def c(x): return check_call(x, shell=True)) is used within a custom setuptools Command class (Preprocess_command) to automate build steps such as running Cython and SWIG for code generation. The shell=True usage is limited to static, well-known build commands (e.g., 'cython --version', 'cython ...', 'swig ...'), and there is no evidence of dynamic or untrusted input being passed to the shell. There are no network operations, obfuscated payloads, credential exfiltration, or other suspicious behaviors present. The context is a standard build process for a scientific Python package (HTSeq), and the use of shell=True is justified for compatibility with build tools. This pattern is common in legitimate setup.py scripts for packages that require C/C++ extension compilation. Therefore, the detection is a false positive.",
