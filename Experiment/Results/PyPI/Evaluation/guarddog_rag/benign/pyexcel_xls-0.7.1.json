      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines (os.system(GS_COMMAND) and os.system(PUBLISH_COMMAND)) are used within a custom setuptools Command class (PublishCommand) in a setup.py script. Their purpose is to automate package publishing tasks, such as building distributions and uploading to PyPI or triggering a GitHub release, which are standard operations in Python packaging workflows. The commands are static, do not involve user data, do not fetch or execute remote code, and are not triggered automatically on install (they require explicit invocation via 'python setup.py publish'). There is no evidence of obfuscation, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or other malicious behaviors. This pattern is common in open-source Python projects and does not match the high-risk indicators for malware or supply chain attacks.",
