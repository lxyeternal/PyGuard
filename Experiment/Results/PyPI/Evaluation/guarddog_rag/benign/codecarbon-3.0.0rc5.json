The endpoint, data structure, and authentication header are consistent with legitimate API usage for configuration and user authentication. There is no evidence of exfiltration of sensitive user/system data to an attacker-controlled or suspicious domain, nor is there any obfuscation, privilege escalation, or code execution from untrusted sources. The code is part of a CLI tool for configuring and managing CodeCarbon projects, and all network operations are transparent, documented, and require user interaction. The use of requests.post here is for legitimate credential/token management, not for data theft or malicious activity.",

      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line (requests.post(self.endpoint_url, json=payload, timeout=10)) is used to send emissions data, including the current username, to a user-specified HTTP endpoint. While this pattern (collecting username and sending it over HTTP) can be seen in malicious code, in this context it is part of a well-documented, open-source library (CodeCarbon) designed to track and report carbon emissions from code execution. The endpoint is not hardcoded or obfuscated, but provided by the user, and the data sent is not inherently sensitive (unless the emissions data itself is sensitive in a particular deployment). There is no evidence of obfuscation, privilege escalation, code injection, or other typical malware behaviors. The code is transparent, with error handling and logging, and is not executed automatically on install or import. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
