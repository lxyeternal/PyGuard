      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line uses subprocess.check_output to invoke 'qd-config' with a specific argument, capturing its output. This is a common and benign pattern in build scripts (such as setup.py) to query system configuration for compiling C/C++ extensions. The command is constructed in a controlled way (['qd-config'] + ['--' + arg]), with 'arg' being a fixed string ('libs' or 'cflags'), not user-supplied or untrusted input. There is no evidence of code injection, privilege escalation, exfiltration, or obfuscation. The subprocess call does not use shell=True, reducing the risk of command injection. The context is a standard build configuration for a Python package, and all other code is consistent with legitimate setup/build logic. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
