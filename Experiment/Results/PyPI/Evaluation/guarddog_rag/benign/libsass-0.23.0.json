These commands do not execute arbitrary or obfuscated code, do not contact external servers (other than legitimate git operations), and do not exfiltrate data or perform privilege escalation. The use of os.system here is for standard file operations (creating a .nojekyll file and copying built documentation), which is a common pattern in deployment scripts. There is no evidence of obfuscation, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or other malicious behaviors. The context is transparent, well-documented, and consistent with legitimate open-source project maintenance workflows.",
