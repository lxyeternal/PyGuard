The command is constructed from static, trusted sources (environment variable or default 'pkg-config'), does not use shell=True, and does not execute arbitrary or remote code. There is no evidence of obfuscation, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or any other suspicious behavior. The subprocess output is used to configure build parameters, not for code execution or system manipulation. This pattern is common in legitimate open-source build scripts (such as cffi's setup.py) and does not match any high-risk or critical-risk malware indicators. The detection is a false positive due to the generic use of subprocess for build-time configuration.",
