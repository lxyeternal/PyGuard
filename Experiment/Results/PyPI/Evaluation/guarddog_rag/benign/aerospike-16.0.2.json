      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines involve the use of subprocess.call and subprocess.run to execute build-related commands (e.g., 'make', 'msbuild', 'dsymutil') within a setuptools/distutils build script for a Python C extension. These commands are static, well-known, and are used to compile native code dependencies (the Aerospike C client) as part of the package build process. There is no evidence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network communication, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation. The commands are not constructed from untrusted input, do not use shell=True, and are limited to standard build operations in project-specific directories. This pattern is common and expected in legitimate Python packages with native extensions. Therefore, the security tool's detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the generic presence of code execution APIs in a setup script, which is benign in this context.",
