The commands executed are standard build commands (./configure, make, make install, autoreconf) and operate only on local, project-scoped directories. There is no evidence of network communication, code obfuscation, execution of remote code, exfiltration, or privilege escalation. The subprocess calls do not use shell=True, and all command arguments are statically defined and not derived from untrusted input. This pattern is common and benign in Python packages that need to build native extensions with bundled dependencies. The code does not exhibit any of the critical or high-risk behaviors associated with malware or supply chain attacks.",
