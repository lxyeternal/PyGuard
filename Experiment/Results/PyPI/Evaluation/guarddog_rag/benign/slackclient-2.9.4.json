      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged use of subprocess.check_call(command) occurs within custom setuptools Command subclasses (e.g., UploadCommand, ValidateCommand) in a setup.py context. The commands executed are standard Python packaging, testing, and publishing commands (e.g., pip install, building wheels, running pytest, uploading to PyPI, git tagging). There is no evidence of obfuscation, external network communication to untrusted domains, exfiltration, or execution of arbitrary/untrusted code. All subprocess calls use static, well-known commands and do not use shell=True, reducing the risk of command injection. The code is transparent, well-documented, and consistent with common patterns in open-source Python package management. Therefore, the detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of subprocess usage in a setup script, which is a common but benign pattern in legitimate Python projects.",
