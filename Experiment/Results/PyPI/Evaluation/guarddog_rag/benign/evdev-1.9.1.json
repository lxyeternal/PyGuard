      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines use subprocess.run to execute local Python scripts (genecodes_c.py and genecodes_py.py) as part of a build process for a Python package (likely evdev or similar). The commands are constructed from static, trusted sources (sys.executable and local script paths), do not use shell=True, do not involve network communication, and do not process untrusted input. The code is part of a setuptools build_ext customization, which is a common and legitimate pattern for generating C source files and Python modules during package installation. There is no evidence of obfuscation, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or execution of arbitrary/untrusted code. The subprocess calls are transparent, logged, and their outputs are written to project-specific files. This is a benign, standard build script pattern, and the security tool's detection is a false positive due to the presence of subprocess.run in a setup script.",
