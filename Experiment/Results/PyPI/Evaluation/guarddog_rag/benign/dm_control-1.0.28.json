      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged code is part of a standard setup script for the 'dm_control' package, a well-known open-source project from DeepMind. The use of subprocess.check_call(command) is to invoke an internal code generation script (autowrap.py) for building CTypes bindings to MuJoCo, which is a legitimate and documented build step. The command arguments are constructed from static, trusted sources (header file paths, output directory), and there is no evidence of obfuscation, network communication, code injection, or execution of untrusted code. The setup() function and custom setuptools commands are standard for Python packages that require code generation or compilation during installation. There are no suspicious endpoints, no exfiltration, no obfuscated payloads, and no privilege escalation. The subprocess call does not use shell=True, reducing the risk of command injection. All operations are transparent, well-documented, and consistent with benign package build practices.",
