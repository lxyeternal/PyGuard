The code is part of the Pyro5 library, a well-known open-source remote object library. There is no evidence of code execution, obfuscation for malicious payload delivery, network exfiltration, or any of the typical behaviors associated with Python malware. The use of getattr on builtins is transparent, not obfuscated, and is only used to reconstruct exception types during deserialization, not to execute arbitrary code. The rest of the code is consistent with standard (de)serialization logic and does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
