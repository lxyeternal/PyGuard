      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line (requests.get) is used to download data (likely package data or source archives) from a remote URL, as part of a package management or data retrieval workflow. The code does not exfiltrate local or sensitive data; instead, it downloads remote resources and extracts them into a local cache directory. There is no evidence of code execution, data exfiltration, credential theft, or obfuscation. The use of requests.get is transparent, with logging, error handling, and extraction limited to tar/zip files. The code is consistent with legitimate package management or data caching logic, not malware. No suspicious endpoints, obfuscated payloads, or install-time execution are present. The detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of a network request, but the context and usage are benign.",
