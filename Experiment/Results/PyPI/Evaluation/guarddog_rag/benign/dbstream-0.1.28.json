      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines (requests.post with data=json.dumps(body)) are used to send monitoring or audit information (such as instance ID, table name, schema, row/column counts, and local working directory) to a URL specified by the MONITORING_URL environment variable. This is a common pattern in enterprise data pipeline, ETL, or database management tools for operational monitoring, auditing, or compliance. The code does not collect or transmit sensitive user credentials, files, or system secrets, nor does it execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or use obfuscated/unknown endpoints. The endpoint is not hardcoded and is expected to be set by the deployment environment, which is typical for legitimate monitoring. There is no evidence of privilege escalation, code injection, or stealthy exfiltration. The code is transparent, with print statements for status codes, and is consistent with benign application telemetry. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
