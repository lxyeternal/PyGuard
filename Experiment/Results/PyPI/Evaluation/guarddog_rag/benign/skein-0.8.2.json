This is a common and legitimate pattern in projects that include Java components and need to build them during installation or development. The command arguments are static, constructed from trusted variables (e.g., VERSION), and do not involve shell=True, dynamic code execution, or network communication. There is no evidence of obfuscation, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or execution of arbitrary/untrusted code. The subprocess call is limited to building project-specific artifacts and does not interact with sensitive system files or external endpoints. This pattern is typical in benign, open-source, multi-language projects and does not match any high-risk or critical malware indicators.",
