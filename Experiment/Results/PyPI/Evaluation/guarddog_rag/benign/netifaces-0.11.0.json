The use of getattr(builtins, 'print', ...) is a compatibility pattern to support both Python 2 and 3, not obfuscation or an attempt to evade detection. The use of os.popen(abspath, 'r') is part of a legitimate build-time test to check if a compiled C test program runs successfully, which is a common pattern in setup scripts for Python C extensions. There is no evidence of code execution from untrusted sources, no network communication, no exfiltration, no obfuscation, and no suspicious or hidden payloads. The code is part of the well-known 'netifaces' package and all operations are consistent with standard build and configuration logic for Python extensions.",
