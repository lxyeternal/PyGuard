      "false_positive_reason": "The code in question is a setup/build script for the DyNet library, a well-known open-source deep learning toolkit. The flagged lines relate to (1) the use of setuptools.setup() to define package metadata and (2) the use of subprocess.Popen to invoke build tools (cmake, make, compilers) as part of the build process. These are standard and expected behaviors for Python packages that include native extensions. There is no evidence of obfuscated code, data exfiltration, arbitrary code execution from untrusted sources, or any of the high-risk behaviors associated with malware. All subprocess calls are to well-known build tools with static arguments, and there is no use of shell=True or dynamic code execution. The only network activity is downloading a dependency (Eigen) from a legitimate GitHub release URL, which is a common practice in scientific computing packages. No sensitive data is collected or transmitted, and all file operations are limited to build directories. Therefore, the tool's detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of subprocess calls and setup hooks, which are benign in this context.",
