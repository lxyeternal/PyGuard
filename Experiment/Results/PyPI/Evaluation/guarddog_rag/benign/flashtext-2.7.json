This is a common and benign pattern in Python packaging. The subprocess call does not use shell=True (reducing injection risk), does not execute arbitrary or remote code, does not contact external servers, and is not triggered automatically during installation or import. It is only executed when the user explicitly runs the test command. There is no evidence of obfuscation, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or other malicious behaviors. The code is transparent, well-documented, and consistent with standard open-source Python packaging practices.",
