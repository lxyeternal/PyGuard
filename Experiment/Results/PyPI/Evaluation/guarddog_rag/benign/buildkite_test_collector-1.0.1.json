      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged code is part of a legitimate analytics/reporting workflow for Buildkite Test Analytics. The function 'submit' collects test result payloads and sends them to the Buildkite Analytics API endpoint (https://analytics-api.buildkite.com/v1/uploads) using an authentication token from the environment. The endpoint, headers, and payload structure are consistent with standard API usage for CI/CD analytics. There is no evidence of obfuscation, credential theft, code execution, or exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure. The code includes error handling and logging, and the endpoint is a well-known, legitimate service. The use of environment variables for configuration and the requests library for HTTP POST is standard practice in such integrations. The detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the generic pattern of sending data via HTTP POST, but the context and implementation are benign.",
