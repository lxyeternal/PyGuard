      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line (use of subprocess.check_output with shell=True) is present in the get_output function, which is only used to invoke krb5-config and similar system utilities to detect system configuration for building C extensions. The commands are constructed from static strings or environment variables that are expected in the context of building GSSAPI bindings (e.g., 'krb5-config --libs gssapi'). There is no evidence of obfuscation, remote code execution, data exfiltration, or any other suspicious behavior. The code is part of a well-known open source project (python-gssapi), and the subprocess usage is a standard pattern for build-time configuration detection in Python C extension setup scripts. No user data is collected or transmitted, and no arbitrary or untrusted input is executed. The use of shell=True is justified by the need to support complex shell command lines, but the commands themselves are not constructed from untrusted sources. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
