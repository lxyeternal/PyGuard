Both are standard operations in cloud/ML infrastructure code, specifically for AWS SageMaker and HuggingFace model management. The code does not exfiltrate sensitive data to untrusted or attacker-controlled endpoints, nor does it execute or process the responses in a suspicious way (e.g., via exec, eval, or shell commands). The endpoints are either local (AWS ECS metadata) or well-known (HuggingFace API). There is no evidence of obfuscation, credential theft, or unauthorized data transmission. The code is consistent with legitimate SDK/library behavior for cloud and model management, and does not match any of the critical or high-risk malware patterns described above.",
