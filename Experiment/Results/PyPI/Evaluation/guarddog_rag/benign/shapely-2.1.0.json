The command and its arguments are not constructed from untrusted or user-supplied input, but from environment variables or static values. There is no evidence of obfuscation, code injection, network exfiltration, or execution of arbitrary or remote code. The subprocess call does not use shell=True, reducing the risk of command injection. The rest of the code is consistent with standard build and packaging logic for a scientific Python library. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
