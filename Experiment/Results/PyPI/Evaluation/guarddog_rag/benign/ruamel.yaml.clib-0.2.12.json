      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines (os.system('pip install .') and subprocess.check_output(cmd)) are used in the context of a setup.py script for a Python package. The os.system('pip install .') call is only executed if the environment variable READTHEDOCS is set to 'True', which is a common pattern for ensuring dependencies are installed in ReadTheDocs build environments. The subprocess.check_output(cmd) is used to install local dependencies (starred packages) during certain tox or pip-egg-info install scenarios, and the command is constructed from trusted, static sources (the local Python executable and local setup.py paths). There is no evidence of obfuscation, network exfiltration, remote code execution, or other typical malware behaviors. All subprocess and os.system calls are limited to local package installation and do not use shell=True or untrusted input. The code is verbose, well-documented, and follows patterns seen in advanced but benign setup.py scripts for complex Python packages. Therefore, the tool's detection is a false positive due to the presence of code execution APIs in a legitimate packaging context.",
