      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged code is a standard use of setuptools.setup() with custom build commands (cmdclass) in a setup script for a Python package (OmegaConf). The custom commands (ANTLRCommand, CleanCommand, SDistCommand, BuildPyCommand, DevelopCommand) are imported from a local build_helpers module, which is a common pattern for extending setuptools functionality in legitimate projects. There is no evidence of network communication, code execution, obfuscation, data exfiltration, or any of the high-risk behaviors associated with Python malware or supply chain attacks. All file and directory operations are limited to package management and build processes. The context, naming, and usage are consistent with benign, open-source package setup scripts. The security tool likely flagged this due to the presence of custom cmdclass entries, which can be abused in malicious packages, but in this context, there is no indication of malicious intent or behavior.",
