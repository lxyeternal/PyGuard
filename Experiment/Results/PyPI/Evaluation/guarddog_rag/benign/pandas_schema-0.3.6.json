The commands are static, do not use shell=True, do not involve any network access, code injection, or obfuscation, and are not triggered automatically during installation (they are only run if the user explicitly invokes the custom commands). There is no evidence of privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or execution of arbitrary/untrusted code. This pattern is common in legitimate Python packages that automate documentation generation. The code is transparent, well-documented, and does not match any high-risk or critical-risk malware patterns described above.",
