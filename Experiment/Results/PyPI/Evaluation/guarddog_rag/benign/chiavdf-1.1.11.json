This is a common and legitimate pattern in Python packages that wrap C/C++ extensions, especially in open-source projects. The command is static, does not use untrusted input, and does not contact external servers or perform any obfuscated or suspicious actions. The use of shell=True is necessary for some build environments but does not, in this context, introduce a code injection risk because the command is hardcoded and not constructed from user input. There is no evidence of privilege escalation, data exfiltration, obfuscation, or other malicious behaviors. The code is consistent with standard build and install scripts for Python packages with native extensions.",
