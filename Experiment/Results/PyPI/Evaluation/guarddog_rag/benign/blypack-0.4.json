This means that whenever the package is installed (e.g., via pip), the code will execute a shell command on the user's system without their knowledge or consent. Executing arbitrary shell commands during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware in the Python ecosystem. While 'whoami' itself only reveals the current username and does not exfiltrate data or perform further actions, the pattern of executing shell commands at install time is highly suspicious and is almost never justified in benign packages. This pattern is used exclusively in malware samples for environment fingerprinting, privilege escalation, or as a placeholder for more dangerous payloads.",
