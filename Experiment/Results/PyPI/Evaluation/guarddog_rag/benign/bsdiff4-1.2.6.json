      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line uses eval() to extract the version string from the bsdiff4/__init__.py file by matching the __version__ assignment. While the use of eval() is generally discouraged due to the risk of arbitrary code execution, in this context it is only evaluating a value that is statically defined in the project's own __init__.py file (e.g., __version__ = '1.2.3'). There is no evidence of input from untrusted sources, network activity, obfuscation, or any other malicious behavior. This pattern is sometimes seen in benign setup.py scripts to avoid duplicating version strings. The rest of the code is standard for a Python package setup script. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
