This is a common and benign pattern in developer tooling, especially in CI/CD, data lineage, or code analysis tools. The code does not contact external servers, does not execute remote code, does not exfiltrate data, and does not use obfuscated or suspicious endpoints. The subprocess usage is limited to running 'git' commands locally to gather repository metadata, which is a standard practice in many open-source tools. There is no evidence of privilege escalation, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code is part of the OpenLineage project, a well-known open-source data lineage framework, and all operations are transparent and consistent with its documented purpose.",
