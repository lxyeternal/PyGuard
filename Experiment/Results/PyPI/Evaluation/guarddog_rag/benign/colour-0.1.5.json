      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines (os.system and subprocess.call) are used in a setup.py script to ensure that a local shell script (autogen.sh) is executed before proceeding with the package setup. The code checks for the existence of autogen.sh, runs it, and then re-invokes the setup script. There is no evidence of network communication, obfuscated payloads, credential exfiltration, or execution of remote/untrusted code. The shell command is constructed from static, project-local paths, and the subprocess call simply re-launches the setup script. These patterns are common in legitimate build or setup scripts, especially in open-source projects that require pre-configuration. The use of these APIs in this context does not match the high-risk or critical-risk patterns associated with malware, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
