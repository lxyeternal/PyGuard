This is a standard and well-documented pattern in many open-source Python packages that require native code compilation. The command is static ('sh ./configure'), not constructed from untrusted or external input, and there is no evidence of obfuscation, network communication, data exfiltration, or execution of remote code. The code is part of a legitimate build process (subprocess32, a well-known backport of the subprocess module), and all operations are transparent and expected for this context. There are no suspicious behaviors such as credential theft, persistence, or privilege escalation. The use of os.system here is benign and necessary for the build process, not for malicious purposes.",
