      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged subprocess.check_call usages are for invoking the 'rst2man' and 'rst2man.py' utilities to build a man page from a reStructuredText source file as part of the package's build process. These commands are static, do not use shell=True, do not involve any network communication, do not execute arbitrary or untrusted code, and operate only on project-local files. The subprocess calls are not used for privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or payload execution. The context is a standard setup/build script for a Python package, and the use of subprocess here is a common, benign pattern for documentation generation. There is no evidence of obfuscation, external communication, or suspicious file system manipulation. The security tool likely flagged these lines due to the generic use of subprocess for code execution, but in this context, the usage is legitimate and not malicious.",
