      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines (os.system(GS_COMMAND) and os.system(PUBLISH_COMMAND)) are used within a custom setuptools Command class (PublishCommand) in a setup.py script. Their purpose is to automate package publishing tasks (building distributions, uploading to PyPI, and optionally creating a GitHub release via 'gease'). The commands are static, do not involve dynamic or untrusted input, do not contact external servers in a hidden or obfuscated way, and are only executed when the user explicitly invokes the 'publish' command (not automatically during install or import). There is no evidence of obfuscation, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or other malicious behaviors. This pattern is common in Python packaging workflows and does not match the high-risk indicators for malware or supply chain attacks.",
