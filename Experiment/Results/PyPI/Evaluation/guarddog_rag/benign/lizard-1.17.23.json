The only external link present is a static HTML anchor tag pointing to 'http://www.lizard.ws/', which is the official website for the Lizard code complexity tool. There are no HTTP requests, code execution, data exfiltration, or any of the typical malicious behaviors described in the knowledge points. The flagged line is simply a footer crediting the tool and does not perform any network or system operations. This is a classic case of a false positive due to the presence of a non-HTTPS external link in a static HTML template, which is common and benign in open-source reporting tools.",
