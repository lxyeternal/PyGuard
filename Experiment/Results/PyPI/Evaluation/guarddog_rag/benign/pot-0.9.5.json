The subprocess call does not use shell=True, does not execute arbitrary or user-supplied code, and does not interact with the network or sensitive files. The output is used to set a compiler flag for building native extensions, which is a common and benign pattern in setup scripts for Python packages with C/C++ components. There is no evidence of code injection, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or other malicious behaviors. The rest of the code is consistent with a standard setup.py for a scientific Python package (POT - Python Optimal Transport).",
