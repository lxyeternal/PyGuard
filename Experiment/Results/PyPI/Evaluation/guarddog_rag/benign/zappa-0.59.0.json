      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines (requests.get to external URLs) are used to download package metadata and wheel files from PyPI, which is standard behavior for a deployment and packaging tool like Zappa. The URLs are hardcoded to trusted sources (PyPI), and there is no evidence of exfiltration of sensitive data, execution of downloaded code, or communication with suspicious or attacker-controlled domains. The code does not collect or transmit user/system information, nor does it perform any obfuscated or hidden actions. All network operations are consistent with legitimate package management and dependency resolution. The use of environment variables for timeouts is a benign configuration pattern. Therefore, the security tool's detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of requests.get and the variable name 'exfiltrate-sensitive-data', but the actual code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.",
