      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged code is a custom build and install script for a Python package that uses setuptools. The detected 'code-execution' patterns (e.g., self.spawn([...])) are standard practice in complex Python packages that need to build C/C++ extensions or manage dependencies via CMake and related tools. All shell commands are static, well-known build or file management utilities (e.g., git, cmake, cp, rm, mkdir, tar, ls), and there is no evidence of obfuscation, network exfiltration, credential access, or execution of arbitrary/untrusted code. No suspicious endpoints, payloads, or privilege escalation attempts are present. The commands are used in the context of building and packaging native extensions, which is a common and benign pattern in open-source scientific and engineering software. The package metadata, URLs, and author information are transparent and consistent with legitimate open-source development. Therefore, the tool's detection is a false positive due to the presence of shell command execution in a setup script, which is not inherently malicious in this context.",
