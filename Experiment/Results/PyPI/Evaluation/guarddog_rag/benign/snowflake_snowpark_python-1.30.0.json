      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line (subprocess.call(protoc_command)) is used to invoke the Protocol Buffer compiler (protoc) to generate Python bindings from .proto files as part of the build process. This is a standard and transparent use of subprocess in the context of a setup/build script for a well-known open-source library (Snowflake Snowpark for Python). The command arguments are constructed from static, project-local paths and do not involve user input, network access, or obfuscated payloads. There is no evidence of privilege escalation, code injection, data exfiltration, or any other suspicious behavior. The subprocess call is not using shell=True, which reduces the risk of command injection. All operations are consistent with legitimate build automation and package management practices. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
