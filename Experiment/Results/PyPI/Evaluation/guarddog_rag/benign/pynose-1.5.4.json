      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged code is located in a setup.py file and is only executed when the script is run with the 'publish' argument, after explicit user confirmation. The os.system calls are used to install build dependencies, run code linting (flake8), clean build directories, build the package, and upload it to PyPI using twine. All shell commands are static, well-known, and related to standard Python packaging workflows. There is no evidence of obfuscation, network exfiltration, credential theft, remote code execution, or any other suspicious or malicious behavior. The use of os.system in this context is common in packaging scripts to automate release processes. No actions are performed automatically during installation or import, and all potentially destructive actions (e.g., deleting build artifacts) are limited to project-specific directories. Therefore, the tool's detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of os.system calls, which are not inherently malicious in this context.",
