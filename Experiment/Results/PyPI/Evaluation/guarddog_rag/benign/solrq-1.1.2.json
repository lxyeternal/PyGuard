While the use of eval() is generally discouraged due to the risk of arbitrary code execution, in this context it is a common (though not best-practice) pattern in Python packaging to extract the version from a source file. The input to eval() is not user-controlled but is read from a static file within the package source (src/solrq/__init__.py), which is under the developer's control. There is no evidence of code execution from untrusted sources, network activity, obfuscation, or other indicators of malicious behavior. The rest of the code is standard for a setup.py file. Therefore, this is a false positive due to the use of eval() in a packaging context.",
