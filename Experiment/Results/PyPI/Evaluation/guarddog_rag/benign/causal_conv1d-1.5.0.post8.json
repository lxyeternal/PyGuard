      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines use subprocess.check_output to invoke system utilities (nvcc and hipcc) to query the installed CUDA or HIP compiler versions. This is a standard and necessary practice in Python packages that build native extensions for GPU acceleration (e.g., PyTorch extensions). The commands are constructed from trusted, local paths (CUDA_HOME/HIP_HOME), do not use shell=True (mitigating command injection risk), and the output is only parsed for version information. There is no evidence of arbitrary code execution, network exfiltration, obfuscation, or any other suspicious behavior. The subprocess usage is limited to environment detection for legitimate build logic, which is common in benign, open-source scientific and machine learning packages.",
