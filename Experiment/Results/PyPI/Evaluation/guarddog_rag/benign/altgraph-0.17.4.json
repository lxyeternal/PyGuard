      "false_positive_reason": "The code flagged by the security tool involves the use of eval in the eval_marker function and the use of custom setuptools commands in setup(). While the use of eval can be dangerous if used on untrusted input, in this context it is only used to evaluate environment markers from the package's own setup.cfg file, which is under the package maintainer's control. There is no evidence of network communication, code download, exfiltration, privilege escalation, or execution of arbitrary shell commands. The setup() call with custom cmdclass is a standard pattern for extending setuptools functionality (e.g., custom test and egg_info commands). The code is well-documented, transparent, and does not exhibit any of the typical characteristics of malware or supply chain attacks. The flagged patterns are present in many benign open-source Python packages and are not, by themselves, indicators of malicious behavior.",
