      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines use subprocess.check_call to run 'yarn install' and 'yarn build' (or 'yarn devBuild') if a webpack.config.js file is present and the build context is detected. This is a common and legitimate pattern in Python projects that bundle JavaScript frontends (e.g., React, Vue) and need to build static assets as part of the packaging process. The commands are static, do not use shell=True, do not download or execute remote code, and do not exfiltrate data or perform privilege escalation. There is no evidence of obfuscation, code injection, or suspicious network activity. The subprocess calls are transparent, error-handled, and limited to standard build operations. This is a classic benign use case in modern Python/JavaScript hybrid projects, and the detection is a false positive due to the generic nature of code execution detection in setup scripts.",
