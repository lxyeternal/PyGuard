      "false_positive_reason": "The code flagged by the security tool is the use of eval() to parse a version tuple from a line in the __init__.py file (e.g., VERSION = (1, 2, 3)). While the use of eval() can be dangerous if used on untrusted input, in this context it is only used to parse a statically defined version tuple from a trusted, project-owned file. There is no evidence of code injection, privilege escalation, network communication, data exfiltration, or any other malicious behavior. The pattern is common in Python packaging scripts to extract version information. The rest of the code is standard setuptools setup logic. Therefore, this is a false positive due to the generic risk of eval(), but the context here is benign and controlled.",
