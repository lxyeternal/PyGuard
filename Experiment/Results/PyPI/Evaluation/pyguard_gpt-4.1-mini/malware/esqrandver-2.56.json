      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest suspicious origins. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during the setup script execution is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on installation without user consent. The rest of the setup.py code appears benign, but the presence of this hidden, obfuscated, and silent execution of a PowerShell payload is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
