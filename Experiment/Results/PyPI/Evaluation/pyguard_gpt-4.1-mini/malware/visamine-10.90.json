      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and only then runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure a specific environment. This execution happens immediately upon import or setup, without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard-looking setup() call for a Python package, which is a common disguise to hide malicious payloads in installation scripts. The presence of subprocess.Popen with hidden window style and encoded PowerShell command in a setup script is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation, potentially leading to system compromise, persistence, or further payload delivery."
