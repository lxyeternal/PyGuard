      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or to detect analysis environments. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code is embedded in installation scripts. The combination of obfuscated, hidden execution of a PowerShell command during package setup, with no user interaction or consent, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including stealth execution, obfuscation, and execution during installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
