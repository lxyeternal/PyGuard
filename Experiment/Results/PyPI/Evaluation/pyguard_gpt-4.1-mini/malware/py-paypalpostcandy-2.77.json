      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious and unrelated domain ('cdn.discordapp.com') under a path that looks like a direct executable download. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the payload if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. This execution happens immediately upon import or setup, without any user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. These patterns match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload delivery, stealth execution, and potential remote code execution during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector."
