      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script that invokes a web request to a suspicious domain 'cdn.discordapp.com' to download and execute a file named 'Esquele.exe' in the user's Windows cache directory. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and runs a secondary payload without user consent or interaction. The check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence tactics. The subprocess.Popen call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, this malicious execution is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which can trigger during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands and network retrieval of an executable payload is a critical risk indicator of malware."
