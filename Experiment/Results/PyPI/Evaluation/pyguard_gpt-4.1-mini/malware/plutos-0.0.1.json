      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It creates a hidden directory on the Windows system drive (C:\\$Windows.~SXK), which is an unusual and suspicious location. It then downloads two executable files (.exe) from hardcoded URLs hosted on Discord's CDN, which are not standard or trusted software distribution sources. The downloaded executables are saved into the hidden directory with suspicious filenames and then immediately executed using os.startfile without any user consent or validation. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection or error reporting. After execution, it attempts to delete the hidden directory, indicating self-cleanup or anti-forensics behavior. The entire sequence is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which could trigger this malicious payload during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. These behaviors—unsolicited download and execution of remote binaries, use of hidden system directories, silent exception handling, and immediate execution of untrusted code—are classic hallmarks of malware and remote code execution attacks."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a hidden-looking directory named 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK' which mimics a Windows system folder to evade suspicion. It then downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL hosted on Discord's CDN (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/939284765427777557/1003012890133016757/main.exe) without any user consent or validation. The downloaded executable is saved into the hidden directory with a suspicious name 'XMICNEI.exe' and immediately executed using os.startfile. This pattern of downloading and executing an external binary silently, without user interaction or integrity checks, is a classic malware behavior indicative of remote payload retrieval and execution. The use of a disguised folder name, hardcoded suspicious URL, lack of error handling, and immediate execution of the downloaded file strongly indicate malicious intent, likely for unauthorized code execution, persistence, or further payload delivery."
