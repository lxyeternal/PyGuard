      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malware. The obfuscated class name, the use of cryptography to hide the payload, and execution during package installation are all hallmarks of malicious intent. The package setup forcibly installs 'fernet' and 'requests' dependencies, which are used only in the malicious install hook. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, and the payload is hidden and executed silently, which is typical for malware aiming to evade detection and gain code execution on the victim system during package installation."
