      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads or executes content from a suspicious URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749497547150594048/Esquele.exe), which is unrelated to the stated purpose of the package. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or repeated execution. This execution happens during the setup process, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The presence of a suspicious author email and package name that do not align with the described functionality also raise red flags. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated payload from an external source during installation, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
