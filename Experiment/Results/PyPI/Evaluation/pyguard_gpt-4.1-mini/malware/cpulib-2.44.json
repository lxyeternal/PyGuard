      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or analysis. This execution happens immediately upon import or setup, without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script. The rest of the code is a standard-looking setup() call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation process. These behaviors align with known supply chain attack vectors and stealthy malware execution techniques, making this code malicious."
