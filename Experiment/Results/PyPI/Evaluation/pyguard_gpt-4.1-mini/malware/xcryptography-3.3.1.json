      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and a suspicious package name, then encodes this data in base64 and further hex-encodes it. It constructs domain names by appending this encoded data as subdomains to a suspicious external DNS domain ('.sub.deliverycontent.online') and performs ping commands to these domains, which is a covert channel technique often used for data exfiltration via DNS queries. Additionally, it sends the encoded data via HTTP POST and GET requests to hardcoded, non-standard, suspicious external domains ('www.deliverycontent.online'). The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection. There is no user interaction or legitimate application logic justifying these network activities. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hex encoding), hardcoded suspicious domains, environment fingerprinting, and multiple network communication methods strongly indicate malicious intent, specifically data exfiltration and potential command-and-control communication. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including environment discovery, covert data transmission, and exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure."
