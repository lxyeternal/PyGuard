      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Therefore, this code is malicious."
