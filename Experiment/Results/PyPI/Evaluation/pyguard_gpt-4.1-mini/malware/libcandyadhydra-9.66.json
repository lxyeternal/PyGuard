      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64 string that, when decoded, likely contains a PowerShell script that downloads or executes further malicious payloads from a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...). The code first checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' and only runs the payload if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. This execution happens silently without user consent or interaction, and the subprocess is created with flags to hide the window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, this malicious execution is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during package installation. The presence of a suspicious author email and the unrelated package metadata further supports the attempt to disguise malicious intent under the guise of a legitimate package. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process creation, suspicious URL, and embedding in a setup script strongly classifies this code as malicious."
