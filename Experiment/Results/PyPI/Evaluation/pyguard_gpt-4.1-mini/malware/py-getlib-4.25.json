      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade detection and static analysis. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or analysis environments. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command is a classic malware pattern to execute arbitrary code stealthily. This execution happens outside of any user consent or interaction and is embedded in a setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. All these factors combined strongly indicate that this code is malicious."
