      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It contains heavily obfuscated and base64-encoded payloads that are dynamically decoded and executed during the package installation process, specifically in the setup script. The code conditionally executes different payloads based on the operating system, with the Windows branch decoding and executing a large base64-encoded PowerShell command that writes and runs an executable file in a hidden manner, a common technique for stealthy malware deployment. The Linux branch similarly decodes and executes a base64-encoded Python script that performs network communication, environment discovery, and likely remote code execution. The code uses obfuscation techniques such as dynamic imports, indirect attribute access, and encoded strings to hide its true intent. It performs environment fingerprinting, collects system and user information, and sends it to hardcoded, suspicious external endpoints. It writes files to user directories without consent and executes them, enabling remote payload retrieval and execution. The presence of these patterns—dynamic code execution from obfuscated sources, network communication to suspicious domains, execution during package installation without user interaction, and hidden process execution—are hallmark behaviors of malware, including supply chain attacks and remote access trojans. Therefore, this code is conclusively malicious."
