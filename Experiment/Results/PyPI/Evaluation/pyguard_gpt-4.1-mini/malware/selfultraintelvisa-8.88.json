      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution window. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The URL embedded in the encoded command (cdndiscardapp.com) is suspicious and unrelated to the stated package purpose, indicating potential remote payload retrieval or command-and-control communication. The malicious payload is triggered during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector to execute code without user consent during installation. The author and email fields appear to be fake or unrelated to any legitimate project. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process creation, suspicious domain usage, and execution during package installation strongly classifies this code as malicious."
