      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command in setup.py, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. During installation, it collects environment information including hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This domain is not related to the package's stated purpose and resembles a collaborator or attacker-controlled server used for data exfiltration or reconnaissance. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this network call. The behavior of exfiltrating system and user information during package installation without notification or authorization is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with known malware patterns involving environment fingerprinting and data leakage in setup/install scripts. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
