      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malware. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during package installation (setup.py) is consistent with malicious intent. Additionally, the package name 'BeaotifulSoup' is a typo-squatting variant of the popular 'BeautifulSoup' package, which is a common tactic used by attackers to trick users into installing malicious packages. The presence of network communication libraries (requests) and cryptography (fernet) in the install hook further supports the conclusion that the package attempts to fetch or execute malicious code during installation. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, and potential remote payload execution."
