      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution window. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens during the import or setup phase without any user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The setup() call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any known legitimate package. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package setup, and lack of user consent or notification, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
