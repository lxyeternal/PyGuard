      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, after running the standard install process, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com). This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical risk indicators: it performs network communication during package installation without user consent, exfiltrates potentially sensitive system information (hostname, cwd, username) to an external, non-standard domain unrelated to the package's stated purpose, and embeds this in the install hook of a setup script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data exfiltration. The use of a suspicious domain and the timing of the network call during installation strongly indicate malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
