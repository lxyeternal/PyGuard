      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and potential further payload delivery or system compromise. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during setup installation strongly indicates malicious intent. The package also declares dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests' which are used solely for this malicious purpose. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction to justify this behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."
