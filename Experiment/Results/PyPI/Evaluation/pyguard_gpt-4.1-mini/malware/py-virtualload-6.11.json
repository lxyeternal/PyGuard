      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It conditionally checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and if it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is run with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and '-EncodedCommand' parameter, which is a known technique to hide execution and evade detection. The encoded command likely contains obfuscated instructions to download or execute further payloads from a suspicious URL (not a standard or trusted domain). This execution happens silently without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script. Such behavior is a hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks or trojanized packages that execute arbitrary code during installation. The presence of subprocess.Popen with hidden PowerShell and encoded commands, combined with the suspicious directory check and the suspicious author email and package name, strongly indicates malicious intent."
