      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. This execution happens silently without user consent or notification, and the use of hidden PowerShell with encoded commands is a hallmark of malware aiming for stealth, persistence, or further payload delivery. Additionally, this malicious execution is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute arbitrary code during package installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload. Therefore, this code is malicious and poses a security risk."
