      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including the contents of sensitive files (/etc/passwd, /etc/hosts), environment variables, current directory listings, process information, and user home directory files. It then serializes this data into JSON, encodes it in base64, and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious external URL ('https://pypi.org/reqs?d=') with a forged Host header ('psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net'). This behavior matches classic data exfiltration patterns seen in malware: gathering sensitive host environment data without user consent and transmitting it covertly to an external server. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload and the forged Host header to disguise the destination further indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code is performing unauthorized information gathering and exfiltration, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
