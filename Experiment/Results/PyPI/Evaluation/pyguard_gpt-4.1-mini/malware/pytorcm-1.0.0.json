      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing obfuscated and encrypted code during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of encrypted payloads in setup/install scripts to hide the true behavior, combined with dynamic execution (exec) of decrypted code, is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery. Additionally, the package setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this hidden payload execution. The obfuscation of class and variable names further supports the intent to conceal malicious activity. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with arbitrary code execution during package installation, a critical security risk."
