      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed without user consent or interaction. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before running the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution occurs during the setup process, which is a classic supply chain attack vector to run malicious code during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, the suspicious directory check, and the use of encoded commands strongly indicates malicious intent."
