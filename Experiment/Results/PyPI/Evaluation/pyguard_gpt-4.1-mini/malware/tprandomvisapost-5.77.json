      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' hint at a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. This execution occurs during the setup script, meaning it triggers on package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command in this manner is a known malware technique to run hidden payloads. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute an obfuscated PowerShell payload during installation, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
