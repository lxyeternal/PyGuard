      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) also raise red flags. The malicious payload is embedded in the setup script, which means it will execute during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. All these factors combined strongly indicate that this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated, and potentially harmful commands on the victim's machine."
