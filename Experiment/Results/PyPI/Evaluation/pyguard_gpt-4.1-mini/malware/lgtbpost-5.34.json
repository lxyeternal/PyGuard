      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure a staging environment. This execution happens silently without user consent or interaction, and the subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to avoid any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is benign by itself, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution in the same script strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during package installation. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, and execution triggered during package setup, all of which are hallmark signs of malicious intent."
