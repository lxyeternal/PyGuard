      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information including hostname, username, current working directory, and a suspicious package name, then encodes this data in base64 and hex formats. It constructs domain names by appending this encoded data as subdomains to a suspicious DNS domain ('.sub.deliverycontent.online') and performs multiple 'ping' commands to these domains, which is a covert channel technique often used for data exfiltration via DNS queries. Additionally, it sends the encoded data via HTTP POST and GET requests to hardcoded, non-standard, suspicious external domains ('www.deliverycontent.online'). The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection. There is no user interaction or legitimate application logic justifying these network communications. The use of obfuscated data encoding, hardcoded suspicious domains, environment fingerprinting, and multiple network exfiltration methods (DNS and HTTP) strongly indicate malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or command-and-control communication behavior commonly observed in malware."
