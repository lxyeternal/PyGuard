      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution window. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest suspicious origins. The use of such encoded PowerShell commands in a setup script (which runs during package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the setup.py code appears to be a decoy or cover, describing a seemingly benign package. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during installation, which is a hallmark of malware."
