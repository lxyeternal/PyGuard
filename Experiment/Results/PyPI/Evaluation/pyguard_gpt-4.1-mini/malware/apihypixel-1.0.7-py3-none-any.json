      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive user information such as IP address, username, and operating system without user consent. It then reads potentially sensitive configuration files related to gaming clients and Minecraft accounts from the user's home directory. The code decodes a base64-encoded URL to fetch a JSON object containing a webhook URL, which is then used to exfiltrate the collected system information and the contents of these configuration files via an HTTP POST request. The use of a Discord webhook URL (obtained dynamically) for data exfiltration, combined with the reading of sensitive files and sending them externally without user interaction or notification, is a classic pattern of information-stealing malware. The code lacks any legitimate application logic or user consent mechanisms and uses obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide the exfiltration endpoint. These behaviors align strongly with malicious activity, specifically credential or configuration theft and data exfiltration."
