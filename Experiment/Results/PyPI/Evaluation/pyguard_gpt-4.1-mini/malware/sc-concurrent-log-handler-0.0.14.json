      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the CustomInstall class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install. During the installation process, it runs a shell command that downloads and executes a remote shell script from a suspicious external URL (https://down.threatest.com/uploads/install.sh) without any user interaction, consent, or validation. The shell command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via os.system, which is a classic obfuscation and evasion technique. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation. The URL is non-standard and unrelated to the package's stated purpose, increasing suspicion. There is no error handling, logging, or user notification around this network fetch and execution, which further indicates malicious intent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including execution of shell commands during install, fetching and running remote code, obfuscation via base64 encoding, and lack of transparency or user consent."
