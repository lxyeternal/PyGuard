      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a subprocess that runs Python commands importing a module named 'secrevtwo' and its submodule 'dist_util' without any user interaction or consent. This subprocess execution is done silently with exception suppression, which is suspicious. The package setup declares a dependency on 'secrevtwo', which appears to be a typo-squatted or suspicious package name (similar to 'secret' or 'secret2'), a common tactic in malicious packages. Executing subprocesses during setup.py execution to import or run code from an external or potentially malicious package is a known supply chain attack vector. This pattern enables arbitrary code execution at install time without user awareness, which is a critical risk and hallmark of malicious behavior. The absence of error handling, the silent suppression of exceptions, and the indirect dynamic execution of code from an external dependency during installation strongly indicate malicious intent."
