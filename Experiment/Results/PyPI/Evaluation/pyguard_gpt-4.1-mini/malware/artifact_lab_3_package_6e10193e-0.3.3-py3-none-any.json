      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell, which is a classic malicious behavior. It creates a network socket and connects to a hardcoded external domain and port (8.tcp.ngrok.io:14060), then duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error (os.dup2 calls). Finally, it spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i) connected to this socket. This allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine without user interaction or consent. The use of a hardcoded external address, immediate spawning of a shell process after connection, and redirection of standard streams to the socket are all strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a function reverse_shell() that creates a TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external domain (8.tcp.ngrok.io) and port, duplicates the socket file descriptor to standard input/output/error, and spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i). This is a classic reverse shell pattern, enabling remote command execution and unauthorized control of the host system. Additionally, the function exfiltrate_env_vars() collects all environment variables (which may include sensitive information such as credentials or tokens) and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded suspicious external URL (a ngrok-free.app domain). This is a clear data exfiltration behavior. The code executes exfiltrate_env_vars() immediately upon running, without any user interaction or consent, further confirming malicious intent. The reverse_shell() function is present but commented out, indicating potential activation for remote access. The use of hardcoded external endpoints, environment variable exfiltration, and reverse shell spawning are all well-known, high-risk malicious patterns. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent evident, and the code is designed to stealthily leak sensitive data and enable remote control, which are hallmark behaviors of malware."
