      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64 string that, when decoded, likely contains a PowerShell script that downloads or executes further malicious payloads from a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...). The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory ('tahg') before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens silently during the package setup process without user consent or interaction, indicating a supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is used as a cover to hide the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated, and potentially harmful commands during installation, which is a hallmark of malware."
