      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or detection. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command is a known malware pattern to execute arbitrary code stealthily. Additionally, this execution is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload execution. Overall, the combination of hidden PowerShell execution, encoded commands, suspicious directory checks, and embedding in a setup script strongly indicates malicious intent."
