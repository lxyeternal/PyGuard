      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or repeated execution. The use of an encoded PowerShell command in a setup script (commonly run during package installation) is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest suspicious or non-standard sources. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload execution during installation. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
