      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions, indicating an attempt to hide malicious activity. The check for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. Additionally, the setup() call with a suspicious package name and author email resembling a known malicious group ('EsqueleSquad', 'tahgoficial@proton.me') further supports the malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated PowerShell commands during package installation or execution, a classic supply chain attack vector and a hallmark of malware."
