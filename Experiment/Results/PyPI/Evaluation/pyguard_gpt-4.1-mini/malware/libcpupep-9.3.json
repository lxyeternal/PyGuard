      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. This execution occurs during the setup script, meaning it triggers on package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess to run hidden PowerShell with encoded commands, combined with obfuscation and silent exception handling, strongly indicates malicious intent such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise."
