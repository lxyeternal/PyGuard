      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that executes automatically during package installation without user consent. It creates directories inside the Windows user's Start Menu Programs Startup folder and another folder named 'Powerpoint' in the same location, which is a known persistence mechanism to run code on system startup. It then clones two GitHub repositories into these directories: one into the Startup\\boot folder and another into the Powerpoint folder. After cloning, it moves a Python script (test.py) from a subfolder in the Startup directory to the Startup directory itself, presumably to ensure it runs on startup. Finally, it executes an .exe file (main.exe) from the cloned 'defonotagrabber' repository inside the Powerpoint folder immediately upon installation. This sequence of actions—automatic execution during install, creation of startup persistence folders, cloning remote repositories from hardcoded URLs, moving scripts to startup locations, and immediate execution of a downloaded executable—matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including persistence setup, remote payload retrieval, and arbitrary code execution without user interaction or validation. The use of hardcoded external GitHub URLs to fetch code and executables, combined with silent execution and no user notification, strongly indicates malicious intent and potential for further payload delivery or system compromise."
