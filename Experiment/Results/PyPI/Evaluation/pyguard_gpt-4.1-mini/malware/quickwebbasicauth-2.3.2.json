      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code is part of a setup.py installation script that performs a suspicious and unauthorized file write operation during package installation. Specifically, it opens the source file of the standard library 'socket' module (obtained via inspect.getsourcefile(socket)) in append-binary-plus mode ('ab+') and writes the contents of 'QuickWebBasicAuth/tmp.py' into it. This behavior is highly unusual and malicious because it modifies a core Python library file without user consent or notification, potentially injecting malicious code into a trusted system module. Such modification can lead to arbitrary code execution whenever the socket module is imported or used, effectively compromising the Python environment. This pattern of writing external code into a standard library file during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. There is no legitimate application logic or documentation justifying this action, and it occurs conditionally when the environment variable 'py_build' is not set, indicating an attempt to evade detection or analysis in certain build environments. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It creates or checks for a suspicious temporary file named 'python_pyc_cache' in the system temp directory, which is used as a marker to control execution flow and persistence. It then spawns a background process running a long sleep command with a special environment variable set, likely to maintain a hidden or persistent process. The main thread dynamically executes obfuscated code that attempts to establish an outbound SSL socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (43.228.69.226) on port 8889. It receives a length-prefixed, base64-encoded, zlib-compressed payload from this connection, decompresses and decodes it, and then executes it dynamically using exec. This pattern of fetching, decoding, and executing remote code at runtime is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and command-and-control communication. The code also uses threading to maintain persistence and evade detection, suppresses all exceptions to avoid revealing its presence, and uses obfuscation techniques such as indirect exec calls and encoded payloads. There is no legitimate application logic, user interaction, or documentation, and the behavior aligns with known malicious patterns such as remote access trojans or backdoors. Therefore, this code is malicious."
