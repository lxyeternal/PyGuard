      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that executes during package installation without user consent. It reads the entire environment variables from '/proc/self/environ', which contains sensitive process environment data, then base64-encodes this data and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (kh5pv9zea8s3kekv8cyubzze95fw3urj.oastify.com). This behavior is a classic example of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration. The use of base64 encoding is a known obfuscation technique to evade detection. The network communication occurs silently during installation, with no user interaction or notification, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The fallback exception handler also attempts to notify the same suspicious domain if the environment file is not found, further indicating intent to communicate with a remote server regardless of local conditions. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including execution of network requests during install, exfiltration of sensitive environment data, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and lack of legitimate application logic surrounding the network activity. Therefore, this code is malicious."
