      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and runs it as a hidden process. This occurs conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting staging or persistence behavior. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The presence of this code inside a setup script (setup.py) means it executes during package installation without user consent, a common supply chain attack vector. The author and email fields appear to be fake or unrelated to any legitimate project. All these factors combined—hidden execution, encoded payload, suspicious external URL, execution during installation, and lack of user interaction—are strong indicators of malicious intent."
