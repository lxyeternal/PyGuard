      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, logged-in username, contents of /etc/passwd (on Linux/macOS), OS information, current directory, and directory listing without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately encodes this sensitive data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external API endpoint (https://rk8xxqzdug.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Test/response). This exfiltration of potentially sensitive system data to an external server is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. Furthermore, this data collection and exfiltration occurs at the top-level script execution, which means it will run automatically during package installation or setup, representing a supply chain attack vector. The use of os.popen to execute shell commands to gather sensitive information, combined with immediate network transmission to a non-standard, hardcoded URL, and the absence of any legitimate application logic or user consent, strongly indicates malicious intent. The setup() call appears to be a cover for this malicious activity, embedding the exfiltration within a package installation script. Therefore, this code is malicious due to unauthorized system information gathering and exfiltration during package installation."
