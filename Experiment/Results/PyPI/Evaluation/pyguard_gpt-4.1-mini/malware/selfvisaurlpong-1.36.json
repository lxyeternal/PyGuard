      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) that appears unrelated to the package's stated purpose and is likely used to download or execute a malicious payload. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which may be a persistence or evasion tactic. This execution occurs during the package setup process, which is a common supply chain attack vector to run malicious code without user consent. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and the commented URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) further suggest malicious intent. The use of try-except blocks that silently pass exceptions suppresses errors and hides malicious activity. Overall, the combination of hidden PowerShell execution with an encoded command, suspicious external URL, execution during package installation, and obfuscation strongly indicates that this code is malicious."
