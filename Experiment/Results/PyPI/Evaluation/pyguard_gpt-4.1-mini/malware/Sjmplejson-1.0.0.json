      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute arbitrary code during package installation without user consent. The run() method checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. The use of encrypted payload and exec() in the install hook is a classic supply chain attack vector, allowing the attacker to run hidden malicious code on the victim's machine during package installation. The package metadata is obfuscated with meaningless strings, and the class name is a long random string, further indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious payload execution context. The code does not perform any legitimate application logic related to the package functionality but instead focuses on stealthy execution of encrypted code at install time. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, enabling remote code execution and potential further payload delivery or system compromise."
