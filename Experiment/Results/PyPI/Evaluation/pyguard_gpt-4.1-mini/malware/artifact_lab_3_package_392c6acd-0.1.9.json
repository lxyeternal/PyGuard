      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell, which is a classic malicious behavior. It creates a network socket that connects to a hardcoded external host and port (4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:10308), duplicates the socket file descriptor to standard input, output, and error, and then executes a bash shell command that redirects input/output over the network socket. This allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the victim machine without user interaction or consent. The use of hardcoded external domain and port, socket duplication to stdin/stdout/stderr, and immediate spawning of an interactive shell over the network are all strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the code is designed to stealthily provide unauthorized remote control of the host system."
