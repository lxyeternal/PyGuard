      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly obfuscated payload embedded in the CustomInstallCommand class, which subclasses setuptools.command.install.install. During the installation process, it performs a character-wise XOR deobfuscation of a large encoded string using a hardcoded key, then dynamically compiles and executes the resulting code via eval(compile(...)). This pattern of obfuscated payload execution at install time is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious PyPI packages. The obfuscation and dynamic execution hide the true intent and payload from static analysis. The code executes arbitrary code during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a critical risk vector for malware delivery. The presence of such obfuscated, dynamically executed code in the setup.py install hook strongly indicates malicious behavior designed to execute hidden payloads on the victim system during package installation."
