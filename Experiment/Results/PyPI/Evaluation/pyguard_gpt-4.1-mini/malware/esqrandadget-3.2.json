      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the process window. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure persistence. The URL embedded in the encoded command points to a suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com) hosting an executable named 'Esquele.exe', which suggests downloading and executing a potentially malicious payload. This behavior is triggered during the setup process of a Python package, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of try-except blocks suppresses any errors, hiding failures and making detection harder. Overall, the code exhibits classic malicious patterns including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, suspicious network activity, and execution during package installation without user consent."
