      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports 'pytransform' and calls 'pyarmor_runtime()', then invokes '__pyarmor__' with a large byte string argument. This pattern is characteristic of PyArmor-protected or obfuscated Python code, which is commonly used to hide the true intent of the code. The presence of a large, opaque byte string passed to '__pyarmor__' strongly suggests that the actual code logic is encrypted or obfuscated and will be dynamically decrypted and executed at runtime. Such obfuscation is a common technique used by malware authors to evade static analysis and hide malicious payloads. Given the extensive use of obfuscation without any clear legitimate application logic, and the known use of PyArmor in malware to conceal harmful behavior, this code is highly suspicious and likely contains malicious behavior."
