      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. This execution happens immediately upon import or running the script, without any user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a setup script for a Python package. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is benign by itself, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution in the same script strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during package installation. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, encoded PowerShell commands, execution during package setup, and suppression of exceptions to avoid detection. Therefore, this code is malicious."
