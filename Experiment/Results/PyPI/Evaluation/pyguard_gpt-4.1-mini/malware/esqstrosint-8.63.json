      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which when decoded reveals a PowerShell invocation that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as '~\\WindowsCache.exe', then executes it. This behavior is consistent with malware that downloads and runs a remote payload without user consent or interaction, using obfuscation and hidden execution to evade detection. The presence of this code in a setup script (commonly run during package installation) indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes automatically during installation. The domain used is unrelated to the package's stated purpose and is suspicious. The code also suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this is a clear case of malicious code designed to download and execute a remote payload stealthily during package installation."
