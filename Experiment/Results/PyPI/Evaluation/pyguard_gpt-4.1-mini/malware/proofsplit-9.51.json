      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated PowerShell payloads stealthily. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating a conditional execution likely for persistence or payload delivery. This execution happens during the import or setup phase without user consent or interaction, which is a typical supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard-looking setup() call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. The use of subprocess with hidden window style and encoded PowerShell command, combined with the conditional directory existence check, strongly indicates malicious intent to execute hidden code on Windows systems stealthily."
