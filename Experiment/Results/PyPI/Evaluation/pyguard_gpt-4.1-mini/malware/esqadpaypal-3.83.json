      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to evade analysis or ensure persistence. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the package name 'esqadpaypal' appear suspicious and unrelated to the declared purpose of the package. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The setup() call itself appears benign but is used as a cover for the malicious payload execution. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution triggered during package installation."
