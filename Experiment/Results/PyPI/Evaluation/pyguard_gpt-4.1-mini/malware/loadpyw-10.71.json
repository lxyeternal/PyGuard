      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist before launching this hidden PowerShell process, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. Such behavior is a hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks or malicious PyPI packages that execute arbitrary code during installation. The use of subprocess with hidden window style and encoded commands, combined with the lack of error handling and silent exception suppression, further confirms the intent to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions. Therefore, this code is malicious."
