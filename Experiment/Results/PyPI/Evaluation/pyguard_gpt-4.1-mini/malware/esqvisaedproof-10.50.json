      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands used to evade detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW, suppressing any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. The malicious payload is embedded in what appears to be a setup script for a Python package, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of try-except blocks that silently pass exceptions suppresses errors and detection. Overall, the code is designed to execute an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell payload during package setup without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of malware."
