      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. This decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent or interaction. The use of a hardcoded cryptographic key and ciphertext to hide the payload is a strong indicator of obfuscation and malicious intent. Executing decrypted code during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector, enabling attackers to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine stealthily. The package metadata and class names are obfuscated and meaningless, further suggesting an attempt to hide malicious behavior. The setup script also specifies dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code execution during install, encrypted payload execution, obfuscation, and lack of user interaction or notification."
