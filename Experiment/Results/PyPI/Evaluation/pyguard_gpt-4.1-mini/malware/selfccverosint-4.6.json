      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. The check for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. The presence of a suspicious author email and domain (EsqueleSquad, tahgoficial@proton.me, www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports malicious intent. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, enabling execution of malicious payloads during package installation. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including stealth execution, obfuscation, and execution during package setup."
