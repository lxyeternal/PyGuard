      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in a setup script context, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command with encoded payload and hidden window style is a hallmark of malware attempting to run arbitrary code stealthily. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Silent exception handling (except: pass) further hides errors and detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
