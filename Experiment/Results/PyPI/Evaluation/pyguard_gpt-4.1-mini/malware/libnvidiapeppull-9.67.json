      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command downloads or executes content from a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) without user consent or interaction. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector to run malicious code upon installation. The use of obfuscated, encoded commands, hidden execution, and suspicious external URLs strongly indicates malicious intent."
