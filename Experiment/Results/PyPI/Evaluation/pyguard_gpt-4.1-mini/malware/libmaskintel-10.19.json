      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen in a setup script (setup.py) to run hidden shell commands during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and use of suspicious external domains, confirming it is malicious."
