This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code or payloads can be fetched and executed on the victim's system during installation. The use of os.system('wget ...') in a post_install function called immediately in setup.py is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables remote code execution and potential further compromise. The domain used is non-standard and suspicious, increasing the risk. There is no validation, error handling, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network activity, which aligns with known malicious patterns."
