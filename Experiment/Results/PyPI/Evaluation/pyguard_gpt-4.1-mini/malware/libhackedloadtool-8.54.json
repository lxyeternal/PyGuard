      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, indicating an attempt to evade static analysis and detection. The command is only run if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated detection or analysis. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package repository or known software. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window, a common malware tactic. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious code during package installation. The overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup, all of which are hallmark behaviors of malware."
