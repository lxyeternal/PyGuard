      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. This is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used by malware to evade detection. The encoded PowerShell command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or analysis environments. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears benign but is used here as a cover or delivery mechanism. The presence of subprocess execution of an encoded PowerShell command in a setup script is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, encoded payloads, execution during package setup, and lack of user interaction or notification."
