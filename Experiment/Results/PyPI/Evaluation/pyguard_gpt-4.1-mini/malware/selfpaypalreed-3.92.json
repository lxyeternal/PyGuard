      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) that is unrelated to the package's stated purpose and likely hosts a malicious executable. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which suggests conditional execution to evade analysis or ensure persistence. This execution happens during the package setup process, which is a common supply chain attack vector to run malicious code upon installation without user consent. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to download and execute a hidden malicious payload during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
