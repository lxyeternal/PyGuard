      "malicious_behavior": "The code extracts saved passwords from the Google Chrome browser by accessing the local Chrome 'Login Data' SQLite database and decrypting stored passwords using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption. It collects sensitive user credentials (website URLs, usernames, and decrypted passwords) without any user consent or interaction. The collected credentials are written to a local file 'passwords.txt'. Immediately afterward, the code sends this file via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external, non-standard endpoint unrelated to any legitimate application purpose. This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential theft and exfiltration of sensitive data to a remote attacker-controlled server. The code suppresses exceptions silently during the exfiltration phase, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. These actions align with multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including credential harvesting, data exfiltration to a hardcoded external URL, use of cryptographic decryption to access protected data, and lack of user consent or notification. Therefore, this code is malicious."
