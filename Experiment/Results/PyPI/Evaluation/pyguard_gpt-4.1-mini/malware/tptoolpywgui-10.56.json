      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that invokes a web request to a suspicious GitHub raw URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden window. This behavior is triggered conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating an attempt to avoid repeated execution or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The domain and URL used are unrelated to the stated package purpose and are suspicious. The overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, remote payload retrieval, and execution during package installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
