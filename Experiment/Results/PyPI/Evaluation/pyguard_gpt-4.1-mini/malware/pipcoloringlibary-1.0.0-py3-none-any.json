      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware (stealer). It collects extensive sensitive data from the victim's system, including browser passwords, cookies, credit card data, Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Minecraft files, system information (Windows key, hardware ID, IP geolocation), and screenshots. It decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption, indicating intent to extract protected credentials. The code exfiltrates this stolen data to a hardcoded suspicious external URL (https://kekwltd.ru/relay/bluescreen) via HTTP POST requests, including Discord webhooks, which is a common C2/exfiltration method. It also attempts to persist by copying itself to the Windows startup folder and can kill Discord-related processes to avoid detection or interference. The code includes clipboard hijacking functionality that replaces cryptocurrency wallet addresses in the clipboard with attacker-controlled addresses, a known theft technique. It performs environment and VM detection to evade analysis. The code installs multiple Python packages dynamically without user consent, uses obfuscated function and variable names, suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, and uses threading to run background stealing tasks stealthily. The presence of hardcoded suspicious URLs, extensive credential theft, persistence mechanisms, and data exfiltration clearly classify this code as malicious malware designed for credential theft and financial fraud."
