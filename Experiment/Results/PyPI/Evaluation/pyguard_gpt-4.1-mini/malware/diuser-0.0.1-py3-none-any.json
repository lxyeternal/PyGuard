      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (a Google Drive link with direct download parameters) without any user interaction or consent. It writes the downloaded content directly to disk as 'default.exe' and immediately executes it using subprocess.run with shell=True. There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification before execution. This pattern—automatic download and execution of a remote executable—is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. The absence of any legitimate application logic, obfuscation to hide intent, and the direct execution of an untrusted binary file strongly indicate malicious behavior."
