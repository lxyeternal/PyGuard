      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call to a suspicious GitHub raw URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe), which downloads or executes a payload without user consent or interaction. This occurs conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a staging or persistence mechanism. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The package metadata uses suspicious names and email addresses, and the overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, and remote payload retrieval. Therefore, this code is malicious."
