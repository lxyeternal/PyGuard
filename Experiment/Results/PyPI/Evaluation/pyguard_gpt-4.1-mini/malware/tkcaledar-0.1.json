      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex integer-to-character conversions to hide string literals. It is embedded inside a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The code conditionally imports modules like pip and win32com, attempts to create and write files in user directories, and uses Windows COM interfaces to create shortcuts, indicating persistence mechanisms. It checks for administrative privileges and performs directory creation and file enumeration in user paths, which are typical behaviors of malware. The obfuscation and dynamic string construction hide potentially malicious payloads and commands. The code also attempts to execute pip commands programmatically, which can be used to install additional malicious packages. The overall structure, obfuscation, and behavior strongly indicate that this code is designed to execute malicious actions during package installation without user consent, consistent with supply chain attack patterns and persistence techniques."
