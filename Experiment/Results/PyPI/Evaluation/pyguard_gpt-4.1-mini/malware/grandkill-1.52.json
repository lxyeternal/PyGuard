      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure persistence. This execution happens during the package setup process, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which serves as a disguise for the malicious payload. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during installation, without user interaction or notification, is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
