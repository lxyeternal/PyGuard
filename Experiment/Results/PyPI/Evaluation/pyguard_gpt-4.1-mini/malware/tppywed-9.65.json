      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the stated package purpose. The setup() call appears to be a decoy, providing a seemingly legitimate package description, but the real intent is to execute the hidden PowerShell payload during installation or import. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as execution of obfuscated shell commands during package setup, use of hidden PowerShell windows, encoded commands, and conditional execution based on file system state, all of which are hallmark signs of malware or supply chain attacks."
