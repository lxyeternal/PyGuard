      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW, suppressing any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The embedded comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The use of subprocess to run encoded PowerShell commands during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on installation without user consent. The rest of the setup() call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
