      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe') during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. It writes this executable directly to disk and immediately executes it using 'os.system' with the 'start' command on Windows platforms. This pattern of fetching and running an external executable during installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. The use of a post-install hook subclassing setuptools.command.install.install to trigger this behavior further confirms the malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation. There is no validation, user notification, or legitimate application logic justifying this network activity and execution, making it a high-risk malicious pattern."
