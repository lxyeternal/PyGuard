      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py install hook). It collects detailed system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive system and user information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL (https://hooks.slack.com/services/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) without any user consent or notification. This behavior is a classic example of information stealing and data exfiltration embedded in a package installation script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL, the collection of sensitive environment and network data, and the immediate transmission of this data during installation without user interaction or legitimate business logic strongly indicate malicious intent."
