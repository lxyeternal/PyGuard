      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses the setuptools install command to register a post-install function (_post_install) that executes upon package installation completion without user interaction or consent. This function collects sensitive environment information including the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (via os.uname()), and the absolute path of the package file. It then encodes this information in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-standard external domain (https://kotko.org) with a query parameter constructed from the company and package name concatenated with the encoded data. This behavior is a classic example of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. Additionally, the function writes a local file 'pocbykotko.txt' with a benign-looking string, likely to mark execution or evade detection. The network communication is unsolicited, automatic, and sends potentially sensitive system information to an untrusted external server, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of base64 encoding for the transmitted data is a common obfuscation tactic to evade detection. The code lacks any user notification, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and exfiltration. Therefore, this code is malicious."
