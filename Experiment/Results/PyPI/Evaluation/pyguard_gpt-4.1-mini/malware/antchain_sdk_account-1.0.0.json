      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command in setup.py, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. During installation, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username without user consent. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io), which is not related to the package's stated purpose. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: execution of network communication during package installation, exfiltration of system-specific information to an attacker-controlled server, use of a hardcoded suspicious URL, and lack of any legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. There is no user interaction, notification, or error handling, increasing the stealthiness of the operation. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malicious code embedded in a Python package setup script, consistent with supply chain attack techniques aimed at reconnaissance and potential further exploitation."
