      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL ('https://nagogy-cdn.dreamyoak.repl.co/cdn/MEYeniKS.exe') without any user interaction, validation, or consent. It writes this executable directly to disk as 'windows.exe' and immediately executes it using subprocess.run. This pattern matches a classic malware behavior of remote payload retrieval and execution, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The absence of error handling, user notification, or any legitimate application logic surrounding the network and execution actions further supports this conclusion. The use of a non-standard, suspicious domain and direct execution of downloaded content without validation is a critical risk and hallmark of malware."
