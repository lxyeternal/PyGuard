      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily extract sensitive authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers (Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome) using the browser_cookie3 library without user consent. It then validates the stolen cookie and, if valid, collects detailed user account information from Roblox APIs, including user ID, RAP, friends count, account age, creation date, username, Robux balance, premium status, and IP address. All this sensitive information, including the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie itself, is exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint not related to the legitimate application. The code performs no user interaction or notification about this data collection and exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL, automated cookie theft from browsers, validation of stolen credentials, and immediate exfiltration of sensitive user data and credentials to an external server are classic hallmarks of malicious credential-stealing malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealing Roblox account credentials and user information for unauthorized use or abuse."
