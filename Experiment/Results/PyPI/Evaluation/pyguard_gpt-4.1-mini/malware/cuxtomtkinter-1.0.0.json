      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated, encrypted payloads and execution during install time strongly indicates malicious intent. The package name 'cuxtomtkinter' and author details appear suspicious and unrelated to the described functionality. The encrypted payload and key are hardcoded, hiding the true payload from static analysis. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as: code execution at install time, obfuscation via encryption, use of exec on decrypted data, and conditional execution only on Windows systems. Therefore, this code is malicious."
