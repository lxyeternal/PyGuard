      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class GruppeInstall that overrides the run() method to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This decrypted payload is not visible in the source and is executed without user consent or interaction during installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution in the install hook is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine at install time. The package metadata and descriptions are obfuscated and meaningless, further suggesting concealment of malicious behavior. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) used only in this hidden install step supports the conclusion that the package is designed to execute hidden malicious code during installation on Windows systems."
