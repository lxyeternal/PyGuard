      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) that appears unrelated to the package's stated purpose and is likely used to download or execute a malicious payload. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution occurs during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector allowing arbitrary code execution without user consent. The use of try-except blocks that silently suppress all exceptions further indicates an attempt to evade detection and error reporting. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden execution of a remote payload during installation, referencing suspicious external resources, and evasion techniques confirms that this code is malicious."
