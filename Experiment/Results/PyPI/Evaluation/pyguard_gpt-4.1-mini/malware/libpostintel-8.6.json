      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution window. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) also suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially supply chain attacks or post-install payload execution. There is no user interaction or consent before executing the hidden PowerShell command, and the payload is obfuscated and executed without validation or logging, all of which are critical indicators of malicious behavior."
