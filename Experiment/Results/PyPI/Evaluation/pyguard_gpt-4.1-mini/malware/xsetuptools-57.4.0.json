      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including hostname, username, package name, and current working directory, then encodes this data in base64 and further hex-encodes it. It constructs domain names by appending this encoded data as subdomains to a suspicious external DNS domain ('.sub.deliverycontent.online') and performs ping commands to these domains, effectively exfiltrating data covertly via DNS queries. Additionally, it sends the encoded data via HTTP POST and GET requests to a hardcoded suspicious external domain ('www.deliverycontent.online') using multiple HTTP client libraries (urllib.request, requests, urllib), all without any user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding and hex encoding), silent exception handling, hardcoded suspicious domains, and automated network communication for environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration are strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware or a command-and-control beacon. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification, and the code is designed to stealthily leak system information to attacker-controlled infrastructure."
