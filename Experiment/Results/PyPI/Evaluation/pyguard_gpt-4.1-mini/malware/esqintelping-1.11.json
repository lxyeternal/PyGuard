      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or analysis. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any known legitimate package. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during the setup script execution is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The rest of the setup.py code appears to be a decoy or cover, describing a seemingly benign package, but the hidden PowerShell execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
