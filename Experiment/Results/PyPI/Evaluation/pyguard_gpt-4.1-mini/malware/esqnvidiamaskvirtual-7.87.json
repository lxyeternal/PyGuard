      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The malicious payload is embedded in the setup script, which means it will execute during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of try-except blocks that silently pass exceptions suppresses errors and hides malicious activity. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, suspicious directory checks, and embedding in a setup script strongly indicates malicious intent."
