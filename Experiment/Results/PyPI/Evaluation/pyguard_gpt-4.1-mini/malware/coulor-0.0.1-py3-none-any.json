      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python script to a temporary file that contains a command to fetch and execute code from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://discock.netlify.app/discock/nigger') without any user interaction or consent. It then attempts to execute this script using a system shell command that launches a Python interpreter variant (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe' to likely suppress the console window), which is a known technique for stealthy execution. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code dynamically, writing to temporary files, using obfuscated imports and indirect execution, and suppressing errors—is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The use of a non-standard, suspicious domain and the immediate execution of downloaded code without validation or user notification further confirms the malicious intent. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
