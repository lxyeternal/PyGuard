      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing obfuscated and encrypted code during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of encrypted payloads to hide the true code, execution during install time, and conditional execution only on Windows systems are typical supply chain attack vectors. The package metadata is obfuscated with meaningless strings, and the class name is a long random string, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this hidden payload execution. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including arbitrary code execution at install time from an encrypted payload, obfuscation, and lack of transparency."
