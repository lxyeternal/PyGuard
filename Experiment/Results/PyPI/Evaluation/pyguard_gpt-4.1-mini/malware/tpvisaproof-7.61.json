      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or sandbox environments. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during the setup script execution is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The setup() call itself appears benign, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution in the same script strongly indicates malicious intent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, encoded payloads, execution during package installation, and obfuscation, confirming the code is malicious."
