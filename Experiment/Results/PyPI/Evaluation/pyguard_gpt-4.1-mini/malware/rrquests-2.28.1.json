      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It fetches a list of executables from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt) without any user interaction or consent. It then downloads these executables from the same IP and writes them directly to disk. After saving, it sets executable permissions on Unix-like systems and immediately executes these downloaded files in the background using shell commands (os.system). This pattern of unsolicited downloading and execution of binaries from a hardcoded external IP is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote payload delivery and execution without user knowledge. Furthermore, the execute() function is called at the start of every HTTP method wrapper (get, post, put, patch, delete, head, options, request), ensuring that this malicious payload retrieval and execution happens transparently whenever any network request is made through these functions. There is no validation, user notification, or integrity check on the downloaded files, increasing the risk of arbitrary code execution. The use of a raw IP address rather than a domain name, absence of error handling, and lack of legitimate application logic around these operations further support the conclusion that this code is malicious."
