      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This means arbitrary code is executed at install time without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The payload is encrypted and obfuscated, hiding its true intent, and is executed immediately during package installation. The use of a custom install command to run hidden, decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. Additionally, the package name 'playwritgh' is suspiciously similar to a known legitimate package 'playwright', suggesting typosquatting. The description and long description are nonsensical strings, which is common in malicious packages to avoid detection. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only for the malicious payload execution. All these factors combined indicate that this code is designed to execute hidden malicious payloads during installation, making it malicious."
