      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed without user consent or interaction. The code first checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' and only runs the payload if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command is a common malware pattern to evade detection. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code is embedded in installation scripts. The combination of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, suppression of exceptions, and the creation of a suspicious directory strongly indicates this code is designed to execute malicious payloads stealthily during installation, consistent with supply chain malware behavior."
