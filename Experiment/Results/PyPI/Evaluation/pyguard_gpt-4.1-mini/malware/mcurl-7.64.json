      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or repeated execution. This behavior is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command with encoded payload and hidden window style is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden, encoded PowerShell execution alongside it strongly suggests the package is attempting to execute malicious code during installation. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a critical risk indicator of malicious activity."
