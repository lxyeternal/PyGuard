      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools' install command to run custom code during installation. In the run() method of GruppeInstall, it checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. The use of encrypted payload hides the true intent and evades static analysis. The package setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this malicious payload execution. The obfuscated description and author details further suggest concealment. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, where malicious code runs during package installation, potentially downloading or executing further payloads, exfiltrating data, or compromising the system. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."
