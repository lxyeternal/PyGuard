      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a JAR executable file from a hardcoded external URL (https://www.mediafire.com/file/9frt7p6z242t7q4/dcbot_3.jar) without any user interaction or validation, and writes it directly into the Windows Startup folder. This folder is a known persistence mechanism on Windows systems, causing the downloaded file to execute automatically on user login. Immediately after downloading, the code executes the JAR file using a subprocess call to 'java -jar' in the Startup directory. This sequence of downloading an executable payload from an external source, placing it in a persistence location, and executing it without user consent or validation is a classic hallmark of malware behavior. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded URL hosting an executable, combined with silent file writing and execution, strongly indicates malicious intent."
