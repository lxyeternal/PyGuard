      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, it collects system information such as the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This behavior occurs automatically during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard URL for exfiltration of environment and user data during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern aligns with known supply chain attack vectors where malicious code embedded in setup.py exfiltrates sensitive system information to attacker-controlled servers. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network call, and the domain used is not associated with the package or any known trusted service. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration and supply chain compromise."
