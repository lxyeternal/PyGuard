      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests evasion or staging behavior. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and unrelated to the stated package purpose. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover, as the real intent is the hidden execution of the PowerShell payload during package installation or import. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, encoded PowerShell commands, execution during package setup, and obfuscation, all of which are hallmark signs of malware or supply chain attacks."
