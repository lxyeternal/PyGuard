      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools' install command to execute custom code during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. It attempts to escalate privileges by checking for administrator rights and relaunching itself with elevated permissions if not already running as admin. It then downloads a file named 'image.png' from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://wpp-api-01hw.onrender.com/api/images/1140884481671188581/image.png) without any validation or user consent. The downloaded file content is base64 decoded and printed, which suggests possible obfuscation or preparation for further malicious use. The use of a hardcoded external URL unrelated to the package's stated purpose, combined with privilege escalation and execution of code during installation, strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. There is no legitimate application logic justifying these actions, no user interaction or notification, and the code suppresses exceptions and silently continues, which are typical evasion techniques. Overall, this pattern matches critical risk indicators for malicious code, including remote payload retrieval, privilege escalation, and execution during package installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://wpp-api-vrv3.onrender.com/api/steal/1140884481671188581/) with a hardcoded header. It then extracts a 'code' field from the JSON response and immediately executes it using exec(). This pattern of fetching code from an untrusted external source and executing it without any validation, user interaction, or consent is a critical indicator of malicious behavior. It enables arbitrary remote code execution, which is a hallmark of malware, backdoors, or remote code injection attacks. The absence of error handling, logging, or any legitimate application logic further supports the conclusion that this code is malicious."
