      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution window. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggests malicious intent or at least a non-standard source. The malicious payload is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, executing code during package installation without user consent. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, encoded PowerShell commands, and execution during setup strongly indicates this code is designed to perform unauthorized actions on the victim's system, consistent with malware behavior."
