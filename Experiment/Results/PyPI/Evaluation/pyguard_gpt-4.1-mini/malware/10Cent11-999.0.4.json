      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute malicious behavior during package installation. Specifically, it creates a TCP socket and connects to a hardcoded external IP address (104.248.19.57) on port 3334. It then duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error (os.dup2 calls), effectively redirecting the shell's I/O to the remote socket. Finally, it spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh) connected to this socket, creating a reverse shell that allows remote command execution on the victim's machine. This behavior is a classic hallmark of a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor, enabling unauthorized remote control without user consent or interaction. Embedding this code in the install command of a Python package is a known supply chain attack vector, as it triggers automatically upon package installation, often without the user's awareness. The use of a hardcoded IP address, absence of any legitimate application logic, and immediate spawning of a shell over a network socket confirm the code's malicious intent."
