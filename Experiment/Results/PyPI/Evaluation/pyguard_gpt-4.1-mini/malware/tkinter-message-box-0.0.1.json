      "malicious_behavior": "The code reads sensitive user data from the Telegram Desktop 'tdata' directory located in the APPDATA folder, which contains Telegram session and credential data. It archives this data into an in-memory ZIP file without user consent or notification. Then, it immediately sends this ZIP archive via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Telegram Bot API endpoint, effectively exfiltrating potentially sensitive user information to an attacker-controlled Telegram chat. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: accessing environment variables to locate sensitive user data, enumerating and reading files from a user-specific application directory, packaging them for exfiltration, and sending them to a hardcoded external URL without user interaction or legitimate application logic. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which could trigger execution during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded Telegram Bot token and chat ID for data exfiltration further confirms malicious intent. Therefore, this code is performing unauthorized data theft and exfiltration, classifying it as malicious."
