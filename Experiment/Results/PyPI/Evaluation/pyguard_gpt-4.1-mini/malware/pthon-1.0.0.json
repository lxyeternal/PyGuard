      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute hidden malicious code during installation. The run() method checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution from an obfuscated source. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector where malicious code is executed without user consent during package installation. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution in the install hook strongly indicates intent to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions. The setup script also declares dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this malicious purpose. There is no legitimate application logic surrounding this network or execution activity, and the encrypted payload likely contains further malicious instructions. This behavior matches multiple high and critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, use of cryptography to hide payload, and execution of decrypted code without user interaction or validation."
