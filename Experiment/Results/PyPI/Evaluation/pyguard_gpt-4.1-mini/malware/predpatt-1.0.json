      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses the setuptools install command to register a post-install function (_post_install) that executes upon package installation without user interaction or consent. This function collects sensitive environment information including the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (via os.uname()), and the absolute path of the package source directory. It then encodes this information in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain (https://kotko.org) with a query parameter constructed from the company and package name concatenated with the encoded data. Additionally, it writes a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with a fixed string, which may be used as a marker or for persistence. The use of environment fingerprinting, data encoding, and exfiltration to a non-standard external domain during package installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. The code executes this behavior silently during installation, without user notification or consent, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
