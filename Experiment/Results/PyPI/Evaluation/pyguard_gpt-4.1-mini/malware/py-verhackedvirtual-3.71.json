      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads or executes content from a suspicious URL (cdndiscardapp.com) that is unrelated to the stated package purpose. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory ('tahg') before executing this hidden command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or repeated execution. This execution happens silently without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the setup code is benign-looking but likely a decoy or cover. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, suspicious hardcoded URLs, and execution triggered during package installation."
