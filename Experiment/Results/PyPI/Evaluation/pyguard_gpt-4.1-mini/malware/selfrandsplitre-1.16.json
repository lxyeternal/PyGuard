      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution window. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The URL embedded in the encoded command (cdndiscardapp.com) is suspicious and unrelated to the stated package purpose, indicating potential remote payload retrieval or command-and-control communication. The malicious code is embedded within a setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute code during package installation without user consent. The use of try-except blocks suppresses any errors, hiding failures and making detection harder. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution, suspicious URL, execution during package setup, and evasion techniques confirms this code is malicious."
