      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or analysis. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious payloads during package installation without user consent. The subprocess call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the setup call appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk patterns: obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and use of suspicious domain/email, all consistent with malware behavior."
