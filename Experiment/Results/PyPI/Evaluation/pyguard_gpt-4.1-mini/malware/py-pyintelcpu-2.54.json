      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The command is executed without user interaction or consent, and only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated detection or analysis. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing arbitrary code execution during package installation. These factors combined match multiple critical risk patterns for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation without user consent."
