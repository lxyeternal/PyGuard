      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that executes automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. It creates directories inside the Windows user's Start Menu Programs folder, specifically in the Startup folder and a suspiciously named 'Powerpoint' folder. It then clones two GitHub repositories into these directories, one of which contains an executable named 'main.exe'. The script moves a Python script ('test.py') from a cloned repository into the Startup folder and immediately executes the 'main.exe' file from the cloned repository. This behavior is a classic persistence mechanism to run code on system startup, combined with automatic downloading and execution of remote code from external GitHub repositories. The use of hardcoded user paths, cloning from external URLs, writing to startup folders, and immediate execution of downloaded executables without validation or user consent are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is consistent with supply chain attacks or malware that installs itself during package installation, enabling remote code execution and persistence on the victim system."
