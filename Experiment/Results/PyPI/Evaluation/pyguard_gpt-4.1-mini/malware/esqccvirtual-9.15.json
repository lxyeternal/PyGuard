      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens silently within a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the use of a non-standard package name and author email reinforce the suspicion. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution during the setup process is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package installation."
