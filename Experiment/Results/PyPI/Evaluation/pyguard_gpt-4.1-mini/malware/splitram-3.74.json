      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions silently, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This behavior is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, the use of hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands in an installation script is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
