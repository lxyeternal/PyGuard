      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the hidden PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure persistence. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a setup script for a Python package. Such behavior is consistent with supply chain attacks or malware that executes payloads during package installation. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses all exceptions, which can be used to hide failures or detection. Overall, the use of hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands in a setup script is a strong and reliable indicator of malicious intent."
