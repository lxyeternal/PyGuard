      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known vector for executing arbitrary code during package installation (a supply chain attack pattern). Inside the overridden run() method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules only on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload and immediately executes it with exec(). This is a classic pattern of obfuscated arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent or interaction. The encrypted payload is not visible in plaintext, hiding the true intent and making static analysis difficult. The use of dynamic import, cryptographic decryption, and exec() in an install hook strongly indicates malicious intent, as it enables remote code execution and potential further payload delivery or system compromise. The package metadata and descriptions are nonsensical and obfuscated, which is typical for malware trying to evade detection. Overall, this code is a high-risk supply chain attack vector that executes hidden malicious code during installation."
