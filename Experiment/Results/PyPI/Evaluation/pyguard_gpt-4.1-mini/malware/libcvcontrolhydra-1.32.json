      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) which appears to be a direct download link for an executable, indicating a likely payload download and execution attempt. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running this command, which may be a persistence or evasion tactic. The subprocess.Popen call uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, the setup() call masquerades as a legitimate package installation but is combined with the hidden execution of the encoded PowerShell command, a classic supply chain attack vector. The author and email fields reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which do not correspond to any known legitimate package and may be used to mislead. The overall pattern—hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell payload during package setup, referencing a suspicious external URL, and suppressing errors—is a hallmark of malware designed to download and execute a remote payload without user consent."
