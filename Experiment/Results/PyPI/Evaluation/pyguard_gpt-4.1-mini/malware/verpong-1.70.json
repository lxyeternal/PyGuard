      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in a setup script context, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. These factors combined—hidden PowerShell execution, encoded payload, execution during package setup, and suppression of exceptions—are strong indicators of malicious intent."
