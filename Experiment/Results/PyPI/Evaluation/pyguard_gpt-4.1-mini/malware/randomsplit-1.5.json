      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. This behavior is embedded in the setup script, which means it triggers during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command, combined with the hidden window style, strongly indicates malicious intent to execute hidden code on the victim's machine. The rest of the setup call appears normal but is overshadowed by this stealthy execution. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this hidden execution, no user interaction, and no error handling, which further supports the malicious classification."
