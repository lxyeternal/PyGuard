      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) which is unrelated to the legitimate package description and author information, suggesting it downloads or executes a potentially malicious executable. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which is a common evasion or staging tactic. This execution occurs during the package setup process without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is used as a cover for the malicious payload execution. The use of subprocess with hidden window style, encoded PowerShell commands, and external suspicious URLs combined with silent exception handling strongly indicates malicious intent."
