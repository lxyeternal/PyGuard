      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py install hook). It collects sensitive system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username without user consent. It attempts to create a file in the root directory (/root/j0j0.poc), which requires elevated privileges and is suspicious. The code enumerates directories on the system (/run/, /etc/, /home/, /mnt/, /rasp/) and sends their listings via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (https://j0j0.xyz) using the hostname and username as part of the URL path. Furthermore, it reads potentially sensitive files (/root/.wget-hsts, /.dockerenv, /run/docker.sock) and exfiltrates their raw contents to the same external server. This behavior is consistent with unauthorized data exfiltration and system fingerprinting. The code runs automatically during package installation without user interaction or notification, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, silent exception handling, and exfiltration of sensitive files and system information strongly indicates malicious intent."
