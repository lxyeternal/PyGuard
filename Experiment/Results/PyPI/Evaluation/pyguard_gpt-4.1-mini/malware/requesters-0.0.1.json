      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and other sensitive user data. It collects environment information such as IP address, username, and geolocation, then exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code accesses local application data directories of browsers and Discord clients, decrypts stored credentials using Windows DPAPI and AES, and uploads stolen tokens and files to external services (e.g., anonfiles). It uses threading to stealthily gather data, suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, and kills processes to access locked files. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, automated credential extraction, decryption of protected data, and exfiltration without user consent are definitive indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
