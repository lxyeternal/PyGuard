      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup.py installation script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks enabling code execution during package installation without user consent. The read_version() function collects extensive system information including the hostname, platform details, current working directory, and network interface information (via ifconfig command). This data is concatenated and base64-encoded, then sent via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://1.15.77.2/v/). The use of a hardcoded IP address rather than a domain name, combined with the exfiltration of detailed system fingerprinting data without user interaction or notification, is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. Additionally, the subprocess.Popen call executes a file named 'version' located alongside the package, which is unusual and potentially a mechanism to run additional malicious code during installation. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network communication or subprocess execution in the context of a version read function. The absence of error handling or user consent, the use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the exfiltrated data, and the embedding of this behavior in the package setup process collectively confirm that this code is malicious."
