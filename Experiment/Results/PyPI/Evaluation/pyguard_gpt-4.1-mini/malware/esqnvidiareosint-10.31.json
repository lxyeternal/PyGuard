      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749497547150594048/Esquele.exe), which is unrelated to the stated purpose of the package and is a common vector for malware delivery. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory 'tahg' before executing this payload, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or repeated execution. This execution happens during the package setup process, which is a classic supply chain attack vector, allowing arbitrary code execution on the victim's system without user consent. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the setup code appears to be a decoy or cover, with innocuous metadata but no legitimate logic to justify the network activity or shell execution. All these factors combined strongly indicate that this code is malicious."
