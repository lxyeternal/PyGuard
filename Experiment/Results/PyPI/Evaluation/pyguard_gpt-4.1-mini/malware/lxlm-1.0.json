      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup.py script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The function zzr() executes immediately during installation, without user interaction or consent. It checks if the platform is Windows, then downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL on GitHub (https://github.com/jagermager999/8746465cdg78cdsxasy8a/raw/main/test.exe) and writes it to disk with a suspicious temporary filename. Immediately after writing, it executes the downloaded file using os.system('start ' + filename), which launches the executable without validation or user notification. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote binary during package installation is a classic indicator of malware, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. The absence of error handling, user prompts, or integrity checks further confirms the malicious intent. The use of a hardcoded external URL to fetch an executable and immediate execution is a critical risk pattern associated exclusively with malware."
