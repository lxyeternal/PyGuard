      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools' install command to override the run() method, which executes during package installation. Within this method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and potential further payload delivery. The use of encrypted and obfuscated payloads in setup/install scripts, combined with dynamic execution, is strongly associated with malware. Additionally, the code only triggers this behavior on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), which suggests targeted malicious intent. The package metadata fields (name, author, description) appear nonsensical or obfuscated, further indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious Python packages."
