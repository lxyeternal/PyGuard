      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command string is unusual and likely intended to run the encoded PowerShell payload silently. This behavior is consistent with malware that executes hidden payloads during package installation or execution, a known supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which may be used to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious intent, including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, and lack of user consent."
