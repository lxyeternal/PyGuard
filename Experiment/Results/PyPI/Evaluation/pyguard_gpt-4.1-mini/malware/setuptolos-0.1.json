      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class 'gpl' that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, it performs the following suspicious actions: it contains an obfuscated string 'l' which is decoded by a ROT13-like cipher to produce a payload string 'h'. It then attempts to open the system file '/etc/passwd' and parses its lines. For each line where the third colon-separated field equals '1000' (commonly a user ID for a regular user), it extracts the username and attempts to open and append the decoded payload string 'h' to the user's '.profile' file located at '/home/{username}/.profile'. This behavior effectively injects hidden code into user profile scripts, which will execute when the user logs in, enabling persistence or further malicious actions. The obfuscation of the payload, silent exception handling, and execution of code during package installation without user consent are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches known supply chain attack vectors where code execution and persistence are established during package installation. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior."
