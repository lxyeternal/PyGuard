      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module named 'httpsrequests', which is not a standard Python library or a commonly known legitimate package. The module name appears suspiciously similar to the legitimate 'requests' library but is altered, which is a common tactic known as typosquatting used by attackers to trick users into installing malicious packages. This kind of import is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as attackers often create such misleading packages to execute malicious code upon import or installation. Given the context of typical malicious patterns and the suspicious module name, this import statement alone is highly indicative of malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily collect Discord user tokens from various local storage paths associated with Discord and multiple Chromium-based browsers. It searches for tokens using regex patterns in local LevelDB files without user consent. It then validates these tokens by making authenticated requests to Discord's API, extracts user information including email, phone number, and billing/payment methods, and compiles this sensitive data. The collected information, along with the victim's IP address, is encoded and sent via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL (which is base64-encoded in the code). This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential theft and data exfiltration. The code operates without any user interaction or notification, uses obfuscated paths and encoded webhook URLs to evade detection, and targets sensitive user credentials and payment information. These characteristics align strongly with known malicious patterns of information-stealing malware, specifically Discord token grabbers, which are used to compromise user accounts and potentially perform financial theft or further attacks."
