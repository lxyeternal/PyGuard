      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) that appears unrelated to the legitimate package description and is likely used to download or execute a malicious payload. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging tactic. The malicious execution is embedded in the setup script, which means it will run during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' further suggest malicious intent or at least an untrusted source. The use of try-except blocks that silently pass exceptions suppresses errors and helps evade detection. Overall, the combination of hidden PowerShell execution, encoded commands, suspicious external URL, execution during setup, and obfuscation strongly indicates this code is malicious."
