      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or detection. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The malicious payload is embedded within a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing code execution during package installation. The subprocess call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup, all of which are hallmark behaviors of malware."
