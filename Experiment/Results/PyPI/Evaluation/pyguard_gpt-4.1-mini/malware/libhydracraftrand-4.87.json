      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious intent within a seemingly normal package installation script. The subprocess call runs without user consent or interaction, in a hidden window, and executes an encoded command, which is a hallmark of malware delivery and execution. This behavior is consistent with supply chain attacks or malware embedded in Python package installation scripts, aiming for remote code execution and stealthy payload deployment."
