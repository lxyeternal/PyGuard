      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It conditionally checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and if it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated and executed without user consent or interaction, which is a classic technique for stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The use of an encoded PowerShell command in a setup script (commonly run during package installation) is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the legitimate purpose of the package described. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, obfuscated payload, execution during package installation, and lack of user consent or notification."
