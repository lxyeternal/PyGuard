      "malicious_behavior": "The code fetches a list of executables from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt) without any user interaction or consent. It filters executables based on the current operating system, downloads these executables from the same suspicious IP, writes them directly to disk, sets executable permissions (on Linux/macOS), and immediately executes them in the background. This download-and-execute pattern from a hardcoded external IP address, combined with no validation, user notification, or error handling, is a classic hallmark of malware. The code also hooks into all HTTP request methods (get, post, put, patch, delete, head, options, request) to trigger this payload delivery and execution on any network request, indicating a stealthy persistence or infection mechanism. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators such as remote payload retrieval, unsupervised execution of downloaded code, use of hardcoded suspicious IPs, and lack of legitimate application logic, confirming the code is malicious."
