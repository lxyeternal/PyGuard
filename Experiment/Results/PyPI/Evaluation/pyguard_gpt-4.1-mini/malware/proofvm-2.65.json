      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then launches this hidden PowerShell process without user consent or interaction. This behavior is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, combined with the silent exception handling, strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads."
