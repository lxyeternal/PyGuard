      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) which appears to be a direct download link to an executable file from Dropbox, a non-standard source for legitimate package resources. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. This execution happens silently without user consent or notification, embedded within a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy or cover, with no legitimate relation to the malicious payload. These factors combined—hidden execution, encoded payload, suspicious external URL, execution during package setup, and lack of user interaction—are strong indicators of malicious behavior."
