      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The command is launched only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated detection or analysis. The URL embedded in the encoded command points to a suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com) and a path that appears to download or execute a file named 'Esquele.exe', which is likely a malicious payload. This behavior is consistent with remote payload retrieval and execution, a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the malicious code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution during package installation without user awareness. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags to hide the window further confirms stealthy execution intent. The rest of the setup configuration appears to be a decoy to disguise the malicious activity. Overall, this code is designed to download and execute a hidden payload from a suspicious external source during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
