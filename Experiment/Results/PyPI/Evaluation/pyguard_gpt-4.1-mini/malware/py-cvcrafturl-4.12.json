      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of malware. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or ensure environment suitability. The PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) to download or execute further code, which is unrelated to the stated purpose of the package and is a common vector for remote code execution and payload delivery. This execution occurs during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector, allowing arbitrary code execution at install time without user awareness. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags to hide the window further confirms the intent to conceal malicious activity. Overall, these behaviors align with critical risk patterns such as obfuscated payload execution, stealthy process spawning, and unauthorized remote code execution, confirming the code is malicious."
