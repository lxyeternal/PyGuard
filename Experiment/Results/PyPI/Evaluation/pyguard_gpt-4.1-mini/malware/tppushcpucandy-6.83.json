      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) that is unrelated to the package's stated purpose and likely downloads and executes a malicious executable. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running this command, which may be a persistence or evasion mechanism. This execution happens during the package setup process without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The package metadata uses suspicious author information and a misleading description unrelated to the actual behavior. The subprocess call uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. All these factors combined strongly indicate that this code is designed to download and execute a malicious payload covertly during package installation."
