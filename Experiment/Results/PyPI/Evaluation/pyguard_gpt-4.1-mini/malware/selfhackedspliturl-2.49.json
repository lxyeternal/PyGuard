      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution window from the user. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The malicious payload is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, enabling code execution during package installation without user consent. The use of subprocess to run encoded PowerShell commands in hidden mode, combined with obfuscation and execution during setup, is a strong indicator of malware designed to execute arbitrary code stealthily on Windows systems."
