      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class GruppeInstall that overrides the install command in setuptools. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This means arbitrary code execution occurs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The payload is encrypted and obfuscated, hiding its true intent, which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. Executing decrypted code at install time is a known supply chain attack vector and a critical risk pattern. The use of external dependencies (requests, fernet) only in this context further supports the suspicion that the package is designed to fetch or execute malicious code. The rest of the setup metadata is obfuscated or meaningless, indicating an attempt to disguise the package's true purpose. Overall, this code exhibits multiple high-risk and critical-risk indicators of malware, including arbitrary code execution during installation, encrypted payload execution, and lack of transparency or user consent."
