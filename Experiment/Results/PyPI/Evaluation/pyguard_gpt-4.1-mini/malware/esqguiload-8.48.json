      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands used to evade detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution window. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. The use of subprocess to run hidden PowerShell commands with encoded payloads during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on installation without user consent. The rest of the setup() call appears to be a decoy to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. All these factors combined strongly indicate that this code is malicious."
