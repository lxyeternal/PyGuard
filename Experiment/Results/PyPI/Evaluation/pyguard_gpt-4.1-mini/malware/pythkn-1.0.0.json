      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing obfuscated and encrypted code at install time without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of malicious activity. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system. Additionally, the package setup specifies dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this hidden malicious purpose. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with supply chain malware that executes hidden payloads during package installation."
