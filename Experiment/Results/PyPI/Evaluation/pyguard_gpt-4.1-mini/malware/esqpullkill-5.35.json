      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest suspicious origins. This execution occurs during the setup script, meaning it runs automatically during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command with encoded payload and hidden window style is a hallmark of malware attempting to execute arbitrary code stealthily. No legitimate application logic justifies this behavior, and the rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy or cover. Therefore, this code is malicious."
