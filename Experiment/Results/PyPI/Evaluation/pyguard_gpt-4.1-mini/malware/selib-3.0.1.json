      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically at runtime using exec and compile. This payload imports modules for temporary file handling and system execution, then downloads and executes code from a suspicious hardcoded URL (https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/hzzzp/raw) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is embedded in the setup script, which means the malicious code executes during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic code execution, and fetching executable content from an external, non-standard domain are strong indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the setup.py appears benign, but the embedded payload clearly performs unauthorized remote code execution, which is a critical security risk."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior hidden in the first few lines. It imports builtins and base64 modules to decode a base64-encoded string, then compiles and executes it dynamically using exec. The decoded payload performs a network operation: it imports urllib.request, opens a hardcoded URL 'https://rentry.co/7nqxy/raw', reads its content, writes it to a temporary file with a random name, and then executes that file via a system shell command. This pattern is a classic remote code retrieval and execution technique used by malware to fetch and run arbitrary code without user consent. The use of base64 encoding and dynamic execution is a strong evasion technique to hide malicious intent. The URL is not a standard or trusted source, indicating potential malicious payload delivery. The rest of the code is a benign-looking terminal color and animation utility library, but the initial hidden payload execution makes the entire code malicious."
