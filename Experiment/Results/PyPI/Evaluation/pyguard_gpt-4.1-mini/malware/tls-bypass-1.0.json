      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python script to a temporary file that contains a command to fetch and execute code from a hardcoded external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/cry6n/raw) without any user interaction or consent. It then attempts to execute this script using a system call that launches a new Python interpreter process. This dynamic fetching and execution of remote code during the package setup process is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of a temporary file to store the payload, the silent suppression of exceptions, and the immediate execution of downloaded code without validation or user notification further confirm the malicious nature. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution from untrusted remote sources, execution during package installation, and lack of transparency or integrity checks."
