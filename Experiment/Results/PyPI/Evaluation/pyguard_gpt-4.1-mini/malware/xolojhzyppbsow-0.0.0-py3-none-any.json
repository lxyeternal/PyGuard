      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and dynamic execution via exec(). The decoded payload itself contains multiple layers of string replacements and further exec() calls, indicating an attempt to hide the true intent of the code. Such obfuscation is a classic hallmark of malicious code aiming to evade static analysis. The code dynamically reconstructs and executes code from encoded data, which is a strong indicator of arbitrary code execution. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, as it allows attackers to conceal payloads, bypass detection, and execute arbitrary commands or payloads on the victim system. The absence of any legitimate application logic, combined with the use of exec on decoded base64 data, confirms that this code contains malicious behavior."
