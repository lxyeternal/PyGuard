      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade detection or repeated runs. The use of an encoded PowerShell command in a setup script (which runs during package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the stated package purpose. The setup call itself appears benign but is used as a cover to embed the malicious payload execution. The subprocess call suppresses exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution during package installation, hidden process spawning, and use of encoded PowerShell commands for stealth and evasion."
