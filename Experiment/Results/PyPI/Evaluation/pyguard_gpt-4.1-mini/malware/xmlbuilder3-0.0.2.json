      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class (CustomInstall) that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. During the installation process, it executes a subprocess call to run a Python module ('poc_nvk.my_module') using the current Python interpreter. This means that arbitrary code within 'poc_nvk.my_module' will be executed immediately upon package installation without user interaction or consent. This pattern is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation. The package name 'xmlbuilder3' and the module 'poc_nvk.my_module' do not correspond to standard or widely recognized libraries, which raises suspicion. The code lacks any validation, user notification, or error handling around this execution, further increasing the risk. According to the provided knowledge points, executing shell commands or subprocesses during installation, especially running arbitrary modules, is a critical risk and a hallmark of malicious packages designed to execute payloads during installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including hostname, operating system name, and IP address, then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://eowdq5q6u6qkhxe.m.pipedream.net/poc) without any user interaction or consent. This pattern is a classic indicator of information gathering and exfiltration, commonly observed in malware. The use of a hardcoded, suspicious external endpoint (a pipedream.net URL, which is often used for capturing webhooks and can be abused for data collection) further supports the malicious nature. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven context justifying this network communication. According to the provided knowledge points, unsolicited collection and transmission of environment and system data to a hardcoded external server without user consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior."
