      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. This execution happens immediately upon import or execution of the script, without any user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of malware. The rest of the code is a standard-looking setup() call for a Python package, which is likely used as a disguise or to facilitate installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
