      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. It subclasses setuptools' install command to execute code during package installation without user consent. It uses obfuscated byte arrays and cryptographic hashing to generate keys and decrypt hardcoded, obfuscated URLs. These URLs are used to download executable payloads from external sources (art1 and art2 URLs derived from XOR operations on obfuscated data). The downloaded content is XOR-decrypted and saved as an executable binary in the user's ~/.local/bin directory under the name 'report_gen'. The binary is then executed silently with stdout and stderr redirected to DEVNULL, indicating stealthy execution. The code performs a file system scan under a hidden or obscure directory (RG[3] decoded to '/Users/Shared') with a complex glob pattern, and only triggers the payload download and execution if a specific hash condition is met, suggesting targeted or conditional execution. The entire process is embedded in the install hook of a Python package, enabling automatic execution upon package installation, a known vector for supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscation, lack of user interaction or notification, network retrieval of executable code, writing and executing files in user directories, and execution during installation are all critical risk factors. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to stealthily download and execute a remote payload on the victim's machine during package installation."
