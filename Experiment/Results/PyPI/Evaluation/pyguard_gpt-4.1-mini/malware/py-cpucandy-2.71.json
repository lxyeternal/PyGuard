      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, suppressing any visible window, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The command is triggered conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. The use of encoded PowerShell commands in a setup script (which runs during package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent. The rest of the setup.py content appears to be a decoy or cover to appear as a legitimate package. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
