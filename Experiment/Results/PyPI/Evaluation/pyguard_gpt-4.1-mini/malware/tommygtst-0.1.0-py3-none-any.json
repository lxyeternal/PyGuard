      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware and clipboard hijacking. It collects extensive sensitive data from the victim's system, including browser-stored passwords, cookies, credit card information, Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Minecraft and Roblox user data, and system information such as Windows keys, hardware IDs, IP geolocation, and more. The code decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption, indicating intent to steal protected credentials. It exfiltrates this data to attacker-controlled Discord webhooks and suspicious external URLs (e.g., https://kekwltd.ru/relay/download), which is a classic data exfiltration technique. The code also modifies Windows startup folders to achieve persistence, kills processes related to Discord and debugging tools to evade detection, and replaces cryptocurrency wallet addresses in the clipboard with attacker-controlled addresses (clipboard hijacking) to steal cryptocurrency. It uses obfuscated function and variable names, suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, and performs network communication without user consent or interaction. The presence of hardcoded suspicious URLs, extensive environment and system fingerprinting, and automated data collection and exfiltration confirm that this code is malicious and designed for credential theft, privacy invasion, and financial fraud."
