      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' hint at a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. This execution occurs during the setup process of a Python package, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, combined with the lack of user interaction, error handling, or legitimate application logic, strongly indicates malicious intent. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be part of malware or a malicious package installer."
