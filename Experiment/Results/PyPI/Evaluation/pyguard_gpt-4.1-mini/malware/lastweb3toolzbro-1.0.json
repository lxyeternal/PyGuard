      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior characterized by the following: It decodes a hardcoded base64-encoded URL that points to a Discord webhook, which is a common technique for obfuscation and evasion. It then searches for Steam-related files (ssfn* files and config directory) in the Program Files (x86) Steam directory, which are sensitive files related to Steam user sessions and authentication. The code packages these files into a zip archive in the TEMP directory without any user consent or interaction. Immediately after, it sends this zip file via an HTTP POST request to the decoded Discord webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating potentially sensitive user data to an attacker-controlled server. The code also attempts to silently delete the zip file afterward to cover its tracks. There is no legitimate application logic, user notification, or error handling that would justify this behavior. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL, base64 obfuscation, data collection from sensitive directories, packaging, and immediate exfiltration without user consent are all strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It decodes a hardcoded, base64-encoded URL that points to a Discord webhook, which is a common technique used by malware to obfuscate the destination of exfiltrated data. The script checks for the existence of a specific directory within the user's AppData Roaming folder (\\AppData\\Roaming\\Exodus), which is likely to contain sensitive user data or configuration files. It then copies this directory to a temporary location, compresses it into a zip archive, and sends the archive via an HTTP POST request to the decoded webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. After sending, it attempts to delete the temporary files silently, which is a typical anti-forensics behavior. The combination of environment discovery (user home directory), obfuscated external URL, exfiltration of potentially sensitive data, use of temporary files, and silent cleanup strongly aligns with known malicious patterns, specifically data theft and exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification, and the use of a Discord webhook for data exfiltration is a known abuse vector. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports multiple modules with suspicious names such as metamask, discord, exodus, machine, lastweb3toolzbro.passwords_cards_cookies, screenshot, telegram, and steam, which are not standard libraries and suggest functionality related to credential or token extraction (e.g., find_tokens, yea, runner, machineinfo). The function stha() attempts to import a module named lastweb3toolzbro.passwords_cards_cookies, which by its name implies harvesting passwords, cards, and cookies, a common behavior in malware. The code suppresses exceptions silently or with minimal logging, which is a common evasion technique. It calls functions like yea(), find_tokens(), runner(), machineinfo(), sikrinsat(), and telegram() inside try-except blocks without clear legitimate context, indicating possible credential theft, environment fingerprinting, screenshot capture, and data exfiltration. The entire stha() function is executed in a separate thread immediately upon import/start, which is a stealthy execution pattern to evade detection. The use of relative imports from suspiciously named modules and the lack of any user interaction or consent before executing these potentially sensitive operations strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or documentation explaining these operations, and the pattern matches known malware behaviors such as credential harvesting, environment reconnaissance, and covert data exfiltration. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

It then sends these tokens in a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external Discord webhook URL, which is base64-decoded within the code. This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential harvesting and exfiltration of sensitive user data without user consent or interaction. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration, combined with scanning multiple application directories for tokens, is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, and the code operates silently, making it malicious."

This pattern is a classic example of credential or wallet data theft malware.

The use of a hardcoded external URL (Discord webhook) for exfiltration, combined with the silent capture and transmission of potentially sensitive user screen data, is a classic pattern of information-stealing malware. The code also attempts to delete the screenshot file afterward to cover its tracks (self-deleting behavior). There is no legitimate application logic, user notification, or consent, and the network activity is solely for exfiltrating user data. These factors strongly indicate malicious intent."

It enumerates multiple Chromium-based browsers on a Windows system, extracts sensitive user data including saved passwords, cookies, credit card information, browsing history, and download history by decrypting encrypted data using the Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData) and AES decryption. It then saves this stolen data into temporary files under the user's AppData Local Temp directory. After collecting this sensitive information, it compresses the data into a zip archive and exfiltrates it by sending an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, base64-obfuscated Discord webhook URL (a suspicious external endpoint). The code performs all these actions without any user interaction or consent, uses obfuscation (base64 encoding of the webhook URL), and targets highly sensitive personal data. These behaviors match multiple critical risk indicators of information-stealing malware, including credential theft, data exfiltration, use of DPAPI decryption outside legitimate contexts, hardcoded suspicious external URLs, and no legitimate application logic or user notification. Therefore, this code is malicious."
