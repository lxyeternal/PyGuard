      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions silently, further indicating malicious intent. The check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks to execute malicious code during package installation. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands on the victim's system without consent, consistent with malware behavior."
