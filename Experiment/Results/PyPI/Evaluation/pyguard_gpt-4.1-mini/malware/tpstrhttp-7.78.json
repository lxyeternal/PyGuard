      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the stated package purpose. The setup() call appears to be a decoy, presenting the package as a benign library, but the hidden PowerShell execution during import or installation is a classic supply chain attack vector. The subprocess call runs without user consent or interaction, suppresses exceptions, and uses hidden window execution, all hallmarks of malware. Therefore, this code is malicious and likely intended to execute unauthorized commands or payloads on the victim's system during package installation or import."
