      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or to detect analysis environments. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the stated package purpose. The malicious payload is embedded in the setup script, which is a known supply chain attack vector, allowing execution of arbitrary code during package installation without user consent. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command and the creation flag to hide the window further confirms intent to execute code stealthily. Overall, this pattern matches multiple high and critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and abuse of the package installation process for unauthorized code execution."
