      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware (stealer). It collects extensive sensitive data from the victim's system, including browser passwords, cookies, credit card data, Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Minecraft files, system information (Windows key, hardware ID, IP geolocation), and screenshots. It decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption, indicating intent to extract protected credentials. The code also performs clipboard hijacking by monitoring and replacing cryptocurrency wallet addresses with attacker-controlled addresses, a known theft technique. It attempts to establish persistence by copying itself to the Windows startup folder. The malware kills processes related to Discord and debugging tools to evade detection. It exfiltrates all collected data and files to a hardcoded suspicious external URL (https://kekwltd.ru/relay/bluescreen) via HTTP POST requests, including uploading zipped archives of stolen data. The code suppresses exceptions to avoid detection and uses threading for stealthy background execution. It also performs environment and VM detection to avoid running in analysis environments. The initial lines install required packages silently and send the PC username to the attacker's server immediately on execution. All these behaviors—credential theft, token stealing, clipboard hijacking, persistence, process killing, environment fingerprinting, and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints—are hallmark malicious actions. Therefore, this code is definitively malicious."
