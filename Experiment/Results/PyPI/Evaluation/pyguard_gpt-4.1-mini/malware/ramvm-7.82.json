      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist before launching this hidden PowerShell process, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user consent or interaction, and is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. These factors combined—hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands, conditional directory existence check, execution during package setup, and suppression of exceptions—are strong indicators of malicious intent."
