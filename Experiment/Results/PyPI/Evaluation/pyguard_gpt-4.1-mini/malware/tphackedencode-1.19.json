      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a conditional execution pattern often used by malware to avoid repeated execution or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window, increasing stealth. The presence of a suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggests a non-legitimate source. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or a cover to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. This pattern of executing obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution without user consent or awareness. Therefore, this code is highly indicative of malware."
