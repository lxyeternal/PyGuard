      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This pattern of executing decrypted code at install time without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted payload, and execution during package installation are all hallmarks of malware. Additionally, the package name 'Matpliotlib' is a typo-squatting attempt on the legitimate 'matplotlib' package, which is a common tactic used by attackers to trick users into installing malicious packages. The setup script also specifies dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook, further indicating that these are included solely to support the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code abuses the package installation process to execute arbitrary, hidden code on the victim's machine, which is a critical security risk."
