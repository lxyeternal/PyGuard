      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which when decoded reveals a PowerShell invocation to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and save it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then execute it. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and runs a secondary payload without user consent or interaction. The check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests an evasion or staging technique. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, the setup() call with the author 'EsqueleSquad' and email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' appears to be a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated, and potentially harmful payload during package installation or execution, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware."
