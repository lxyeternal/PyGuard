      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: 1) It installs a large number of packages without user consent, including suspicious or uncommon ones. 2) It attempts to copy the 'Cryptodome' package directory to 'Crypto', a known technique to bypass certain package import restrictions, which is suspicious. 3) It writes a Python script ('pl.py') containing an encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed at runtime using the 'fernet' module, indicating obfuscated and hidden code execution. 4) It silently suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. 5) It downloads a Python script from a suspicious external URL ('https://kekwltd.ru/run.py') and writes it to the Windows Startup folder, setting it hidden and attempting to execute it, which is a classic persistence mechanism. 6) The use of subprocess with flags to hide windows and detach processes further indicates stealthy execution. 7) The overall pattern of encrypted payload execution, remote code download, persistence setup, and stealthy process spawning matches known malware behaviors and supply chain attack vectors. Therefore, this code is malicious."
