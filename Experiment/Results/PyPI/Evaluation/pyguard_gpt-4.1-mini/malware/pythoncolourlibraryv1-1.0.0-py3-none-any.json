      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware and clipboard hijacking. Key malicious actions include: \n\n1. Credential and Token Theft: The code accesses and decrypts sensitive data such as browser-stored passwords, cookies, credit card information, Discord tokens, Minecraft and Roblox credentials, and other user data from various browsers and applications. It uses Windows DPAPI decryption (CryptUnprotectData) to extract encrypted secrets.\n\n2. Data Exfiltration: The stolen data is collected, compressed into zip files, and sent to attacker-controlled endpoints via HTTP POST requests to suspicious URLs (e.g., https://kekwltd.ru/relay). The code also sends system fingerprinting information (IP, hardware IDs, Windows keys, user names) to these endpoints.\n\n3. Clipboard Hijacking: The auto_copy_wallet class monitors the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet addresses and replaces them with attacker-controlled addresses, a classic cryptocurrency theft technique.\n\n4. Persistence and Evasion: The code attempts to copy itself into the Windows startup folder to maintain persistence. It also kills processes related to Discord and debugging tools to evade detection.\n\n5. Environment and VM Detection: The NoDebugg class checks for virtual machine environments, known usernames, hardware IDs, and IP addresses to avoid running in analysis or sandbox environments.\n\n6. Use of Obfuscation and Randomization: The code uses obfuscated function and variable names, random filename generation, and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection.\n\n7. Network Communication: The code installs required packages dynamically, performs HTTP requests to suspicious domains, and posts collected data without user consent.\n\n8. No Legitimate User Interaction: The code runs autonomously without any user interaction or consent, performing stealthy data collection and exfiltration.\n\nGiven these behaviors, the code is a sophisticated malware sample designed for credential theft, cryptocurrency theft via clipboard hijacking, and persistent data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers."
