      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and immediately executes the decrypted code with exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malware. The payload is obfuscated and hidden inside the setup.py install hook, which is a known technique to evade detection and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation. The use of cryptography to hide the payload, dynamic imports, and execution of decrypted code during installation, combined with the absence of any legitimate application logic around this behavior, confirms the malicious intent."
