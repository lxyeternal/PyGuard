      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute a reverse shell during package installation. Specifically, it creates a TCP socket that connects to a hardcoded external IP address (39.101.72.63) on port 4242, then duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error (os.dup2 calls), and finally spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i) connected to this socket. This behavior enables an attacker to gain remote command execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction, triggered automatically during package installation. Such use of network socket redirection to spawn a shell is a classic hallmark of a reverse shell backdoor and is exclusively associated with malicious activity. The code is embedded in the setup.py install hook, which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification, and the hardcoded IP and port indicate a command-and-control server. Therefore, this code is malicious."
