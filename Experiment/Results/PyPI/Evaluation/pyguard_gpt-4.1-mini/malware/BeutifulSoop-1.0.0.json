      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). This means arbitrary code execution occurs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload and exec() to run decrypted code is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique commonly used in malware. The package name 'BeutifulSoop' is a typo-squatting variant of the popular 'BeautifulSoup' package, which is a known tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The setup script triggers this malicious code execution as a side effect of installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) in the install hook further indicates potential for remote code execution or payload retrieval. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation via encrypted payload, and use of a typo-squatted package name."
