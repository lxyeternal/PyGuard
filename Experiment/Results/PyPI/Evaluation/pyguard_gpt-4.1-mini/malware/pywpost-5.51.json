      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this hidden command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure persistence. This execution happens immediately upon import or setup, without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded payload in the same script strongly indicates malicious intent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated payload on Windows systems during package installation or import, which is a hallmark of malware."
