      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a temporary Python script file containing an obfuscated one-liner that fetches and executes code from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://pub-419bfb1465754687a6ed3a1145bf7202.r2.dev/lSnPxksiKyOTXyT1) without any user interaction or consent. It then attempts to execute this script via a shell command on Windows systems by spawning a new process with the Python executable. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector where arbitrary remote code is downloaded and executed during package installation (setup.py). The use of exec() on network-fetched data, obfuscated variable names, writing and executing a temporary file, and the lack of validation or user notification are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The external URL is not related to the declared package purpose (a Discord API client), indicating the code is designed to surreptitiously execute unauthorized payloads on the victim's machine."
