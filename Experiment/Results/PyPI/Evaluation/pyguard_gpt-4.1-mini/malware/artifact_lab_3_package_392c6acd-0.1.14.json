      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell, which is a classic and highly reliable indicator of malicious activity. It creates a network socket and connects to a hardcoded external host and port (6.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:19048) without any user interaction or consent. It then duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error, effectively redirecting the shell's I/O to the remote server. Finally, it spawns an interactive bash shell (/bin/bash -i), allowing the remote server to execute arbitrary commands on the victim machine. This pattern is a hallmark of remote access trojans (RATs) and backdoors, enabling unauthorized remote control of the host system. There is no legitimate application logic, user notification, or error handling that would justify this behavior. The use of a hardcoded external domain and port, immediate shell spawning, and socket redirection to standard streams are all critical risk indicators of malware."
