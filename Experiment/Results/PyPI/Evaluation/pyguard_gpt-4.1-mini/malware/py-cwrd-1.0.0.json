      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known vector for executing arbitrary code during package installation (a supply chain attack pattern). Inside the overridden run() method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules only on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and immediately executes it with exec(). This dynamic execution of decrypted code at install time without user consent is a critical red flag for malware. The encrypted payload is obfuscated, hiding the true intent and evading static analysis. The use of external dependencies (requests, fernet) only for this purpose further supports malicious intent. The package metadata is filled with meaningless strings, which is typical for malicious packages trying to appear innocuous. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including arbitrary code execution during installation, obfuscation, and use of encrypted payloads executed via exec()."
