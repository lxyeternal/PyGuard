      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It contains heavily obfuscated and encoded payloads, including base64 and base32 encoded data, zlib decompression, and cryptographic decryption using Fernet with a hardcoded key. The code dynamically loads and executes this decoded payload via exec(), which is a classic technique for hiding malicious intent and evading static analysis. The presence of a large encrypted blob and the use of dynamic code execution strongly suggest that the code is designed to execute hidden or unauthorized functionality. Additionally, the code imports cryptography modules and performs complex decoding and decryption steps without any legitimate application logic or user interaction. The obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic execution patterns align with known malware behaviors such as remote code execution, payload delivery, or backdoor installation. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
