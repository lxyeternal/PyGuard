      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of malware. The command is triggered conditionally if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating possible staging or evasion logic. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a non-standard or suspicious source. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution occurs during the setup process, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution, conditional directory checks, and execution during package setup strongly classifies this code as malicious."
