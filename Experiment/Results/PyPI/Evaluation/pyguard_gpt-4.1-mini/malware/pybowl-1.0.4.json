      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior embedded in the installation process of a Python package. Specifically, the CustomInstallCommand class overrides the install command to execute a large base64-decoded payload during package installation without user consent. This payload performs multiple malicious actions: it collects detailed system information (e.g., username, OS details, network info), writes and executes multiple PowerShell scripts and binaries from hardcoded suspicious paths, downloads and runs executables from external URLs (e.g., https://api-hw.com/dl/w), and runs shell commands with administrative privileges. The use of base64 encoding to hide the payload, execution of shell commands during install, writing and running files in user directories, and contacting external non-standard domains are all classic indicators of malware and supply chain attacks. The code suppresses exceptions to avoid detection and performs these actions silently during installation, which is a critical risk pattern. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to compromise the host system during package installation."
