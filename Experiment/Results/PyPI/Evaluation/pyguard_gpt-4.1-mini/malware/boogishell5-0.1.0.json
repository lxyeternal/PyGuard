      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that executes a shell command during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. Specifically, it runs a bash reverse shell command that attempts to open an interactive shell and redirect input/output over a TCP connection to a hardcoded external IP address (114.116.119.253) on port 7777. This behavior is a classic indicator of a remote access trojan (RAT) or reverse shell payload, enabling unauthorized remote control of the victim's system. The execution of such a command during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector, allowing attackers to gain remote code execution on the target machine stealthily. The use of a hardcoded IP address, lack of any legitimate application logic or user notification, and execution triggered automatically during installation all strongly indicate malicious intent."
