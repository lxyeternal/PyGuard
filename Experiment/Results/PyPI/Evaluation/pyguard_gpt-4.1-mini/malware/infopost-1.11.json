      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this hidden PowerShell process, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure persistence. This execution happens during the package setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the setup.py code appears to be a legitimate package setup call, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands in the installation script is a critical indicator of malicious intent."
