      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command with a custom class GruppeInstall. In the run() method, it conditionally executes code only on Windows (os.name == 'nt'). It imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules dynamically and then uses Fernet symmetric encryption with a hardcoded key to decrypt an encrypted payload. The decrypted payload is then executed immediately via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malware. The use of obfuscated encrypted payload hides the true intent and evades static analysis. The presence of network-related modules (requests) suggests possible network communication or payload retrieval, although the exact decrypted code is not visible here. The code runs automatically during package installation, which is a critical risk behavior enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system. The obfuscation, lack of user interaction, and execution of decrypted code at install time confirm malicious intent."
