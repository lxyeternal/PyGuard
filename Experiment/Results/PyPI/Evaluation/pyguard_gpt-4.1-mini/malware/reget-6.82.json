      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. This execution happens silently within a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is benign in itself but here serves as a cover or delivery mechanism. The presence of hidden, encoded PowerShell execution triggered during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent."
