      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package repository. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command is a classic malware technique to run hidden payloads without user consent or interaction. This code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute an obfuscated PowerShell payload during installation without user knowledge, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
