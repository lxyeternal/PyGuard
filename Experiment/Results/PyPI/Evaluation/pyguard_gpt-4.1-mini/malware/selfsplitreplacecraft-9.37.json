      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads or executes content from a suspicious and unrelated URL (cdndiscardapp.com) that is not associated with the legitimate package or author. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or repeated execution. This execution happens immediately during the import or setup phase without user consent or interaction, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. All these factors combined—hidden PowerShell execution, encoded commands, suspicious external URL, conditional execution, and execution during package setup—are strong indicators of malicious intent."
