      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which triggers execution during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The code contains large base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and executed dynamically via exec(), a classic obfuscation and code injection technique used to evade detection. It performs environment discovery, collects system and user information, and sends data to hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. The code writes files to disk, including executables, without user consent or validation, and executes shell commands, often in hidden or background contexts. It uses obfuscated and indirect imports, dynamic code execution, and network communication to download and run further payloads. The presence of these patterns—dynamic execution of decoded data, network exfiltration, file writing and execution during install, obfuscation, and lack of user interaction—are definitive hallmarks of malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
