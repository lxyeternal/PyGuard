      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command via subprocess.run with shell=True, which sends an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eot0n2yp3autvqq.m.pipedream.net). The request headers and data include sensitive system information such as the hostname, current user (whoami), current working directory (pwd), directory listing (ls -la), and user identity (id). This behavior constitutes automated environment discovery and exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information without user consent or interaction. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded external endpoint for data exfiltration, combined with the immediate execution of this command during script run, aligns with multiple critical risk indicators of malicious activity, including unauthorized data exfiltration and potential reconnaissance for further attacks."
