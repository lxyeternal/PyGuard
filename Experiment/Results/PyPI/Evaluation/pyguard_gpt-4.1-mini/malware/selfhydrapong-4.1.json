      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) which appears to be a remote executable download, suggesting a payload retrieval and execution attempt. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. Additionally, this malicious execution is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known supply chain attack vector to execute code during package installation without user consent. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and the commented URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' further hint at malicious intent. The use of try-except blocks that silently pass exceptions suppresses errors and detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a remote payload during package installation, a classic malware behavior."
