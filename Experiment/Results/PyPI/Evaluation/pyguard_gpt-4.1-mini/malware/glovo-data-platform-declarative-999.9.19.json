      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects detailed system information including the stack trace, environment variable keys, system uname data, and the public IP address of the host. This information is then encoded as JSON and sent via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, base64-encoded URL that decodes to a suspicious external domain (hooks.slack.com, which is a Slack webhook URL, often abused for data exfiltration). The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL is a common obfuscation technique to evade detection. The code attempts to avoid execution in known analysis environments by checking the hostname and the filename of the running script, which is a typical anti-analysis tactic. There is no user interaction or consent before this data collection and exfiltration. Finally, the script terminates immediately with exit(1), which is often used to avoid further execution or detection. Taken together, these behaviors—environment fingerprinting, obfuscated external communication, data exfiltration without user consent, and anti-analysis checks—are classic hallmarks of malicious code."
