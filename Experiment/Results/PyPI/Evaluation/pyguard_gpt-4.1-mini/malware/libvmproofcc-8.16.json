      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before launching this hidden PowerShell process, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure environment suitability. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and the commented URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' suggest a suspicious or malicious origin. The subprocess call uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the setup call is benign-looking but likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
