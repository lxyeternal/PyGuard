      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens immediately upon import or setup, without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script. Such behavior is a hallmark of malware, often used for downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but is overshadowed by the hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
