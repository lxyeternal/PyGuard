      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute hidden malicious code during installation. The run() method checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution from an obfuscated source. The use of encrypted payload and exec() in the install hook is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution without user consent. The package metadata is obfuscated with meaningless strings, and the class name is a long random string, further indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious payload execution context. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as code execution during install, obfuscated encrypted payload, use of exec on decrypted data, and no user interaction or notification. Therefore, this code is malicious."
