      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses setuptools.setup in combination with an exec() call on a base64-decoded string, which is a strong indicator of obfuscated malicious behavior. The decoded payload creates a socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (192.168.252.178) on port 9001, attempts to connect, and then duplicates the socket file descriptor to standard input, output, and error, effectively creating a reverse shell. This allows remote command execution on the victim machine without user consent or interaction. The use of base64 encoding to hide the payload, dynamic execution via exec(), and network socket manipulation to establish a reverse shell are classic hallmarks of malware. The code is embedded in a setup script, which means it executes during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. All these factors combined confirm that the code contains malicious behavior."
