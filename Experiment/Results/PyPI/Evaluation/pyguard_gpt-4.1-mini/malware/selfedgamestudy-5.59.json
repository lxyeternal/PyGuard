      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which when decoded reveals a PowerShell invocation of an external URL (https://esquelesquad.000webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquada.exe) to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe'. This behavior is consistent with remote payload retrieval and execution, a hallmark of malware. The code also checks for the existence of a suspicious directory 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The subprocess.Popen call uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, this malicious execution is embedded in a setup script context, which can trigger during package installation without user consent, a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of a suspicious author email and domain further supports malicious intent. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, remote code download and execution, and execution during package installation, confirming it is malicious."
