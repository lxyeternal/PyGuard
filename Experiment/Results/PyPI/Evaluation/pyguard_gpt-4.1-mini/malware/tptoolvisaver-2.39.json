      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW, suppressing any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is likely a decoy or cover for the malicious payload execution. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially supply chain attacks or malicious PyPI packages that execute hidden code during installation without user consent."
