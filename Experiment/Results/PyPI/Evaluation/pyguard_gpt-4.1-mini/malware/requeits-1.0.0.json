      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known vector for executing arbitrary code during package installation (a supply chain attack pattern). Inside the overridden run() method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' only on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and immediately executes it with exec(). This is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution of an obfuscated payload at install time without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload hides the true intent and evades static analysis. The package name 'requeits' is a typo-squatting variant of 'requests', a popular library, which is a common tactic in malicious PyPI packages. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook. The encrypted payload likely contains further malicious code, possibly downloading or executing additional malware or exfiltrating data. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution during package installation, which is highly dangerous and malicious."
