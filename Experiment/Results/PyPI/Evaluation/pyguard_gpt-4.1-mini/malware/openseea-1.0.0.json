      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. This behavior is typical of supply chain attacks where malicious code is embedded in the package installation process. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during installation strongly indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent and execute unauthorized code on the victim's machine. The setup script also specifies dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this malicious payload execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction to justify this behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."
