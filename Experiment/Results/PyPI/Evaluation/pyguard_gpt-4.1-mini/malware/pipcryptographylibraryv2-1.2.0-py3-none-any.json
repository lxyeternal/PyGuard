      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It collects extensive sensitive data from the victim's system, including Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, credit card data, browsing history, Minecraft and Roblox credentials, and system information such as Windows keys, hardware IDs, IP geolocation, and more. It uses Windows DPAPI decryption (CryptUnprotectData) to decrypt stored credentials and browser data. The code exfiltrates this stolen data to attacker-controlled endpoints, specifically hardcoded URLs and Discord webhooks hosted on suspicious domains (e.g., kekwltd.ru). It also attempts to persist by copying itself to the Windows startup folder and can kill Discord-related processes to evade detection or prevent token invalidation. The code includes clipboard hijacking functionality that replaces cryptocurrency wallet addresses in the clipboard with attacker-controlled addresses, a known theft technique. It uses obfuscated function and variable names, suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, and performs network communication without user consent or interaction. The presence of multi-threading to perform background data collection and exfiltration, combined with the use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, environment fingerprinting, and stealth techniques, confirms the code is a credential stealer and spyware malware. This code is designed to silently harvest and exfiltrate sensitive user data for malicious purposes."
