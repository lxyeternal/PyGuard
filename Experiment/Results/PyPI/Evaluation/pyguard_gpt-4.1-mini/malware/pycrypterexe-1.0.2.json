      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a setuptools setup script that, during package installation, automatically downloads a Python script from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotInfected/tasgasgasg/main/WindowsUpdate.py) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this downloaded content to a local file named 'WindowsUpdate.py' and immediately executes it via a shell subprocess call ('python WindowsUpdate.py'). After execution, it deletes the file. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code during package installation without validation, user notification, or integrity checks—is a classic and critical indicator of malicious behavior, commonly used in supply chain attacks and malware delivery. The use of a hardcoded URL to fetch executable code, execution via subprocess with shell=True, and self-deleting behavior further confirm the malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent surrounding this network activity and code execution, making this code highly suspicious and dangerous."
