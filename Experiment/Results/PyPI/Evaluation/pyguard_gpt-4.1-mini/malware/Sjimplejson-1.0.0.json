      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it embeds encrypted and obfuscated payload execution within the package installation process (setup.py). Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute decrypted code at install time without user consent. The payload is decrypted using a hardcoded Fernet key and executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag for arbitrary code execution. This execution only triggers on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), indicating targeted behavior. The use of external dependencies 'requests' and 'fernet' solely for this purpose, combined with obfuscated class and variable names, further indicates intent to hide malicious activity. Executing arbitrary code during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector, enabling attackers to run arbitrary commands or payloads on the victim's machine stealthily. The lack of any legitimate application logic around this behavior, absence of user interaction or notification, and the use of encrypted payloads to evade detection confirm that this code is malicious."
