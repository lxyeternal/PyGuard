      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'GruppeInstall' that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing obfuscated and encrypted code during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution in setup/install scripts is a known supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine at install time. The obfuscation of package metadata (e.g., description and long_description) further supports the intent to hide malicious activity. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with supply chain malware that executes hidden payloads during package installation."
