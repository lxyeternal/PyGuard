      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It enumerates and accesses sensitive user data from multiple installed applications, including Discord and various Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, OperaGX). The code attempts to extract authentication tokens from Discord and other apps by reading local storage files and decrypting them using Windows DPAPI (win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData) and AES-GCM decryption. It also copies and decrypts browser login data and cookies, extracting saved passwords and cookies, which are sensitive credentials. The extracted tokens, passwords, and cookies are written to local text files named with the current username. Subsequently, the code attempts to exfiltrate these files to external endpoints: a hardcoded Discord webhook URL and optionally a Telegram bot API endpoint (though the Telegram token and chat ID are placeholders). The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code performs these actions without any user interaction or consent, silently collecting and sending sensitive credentials. It also deletes the local files after exfiltration, indicating anti-forensic behavior. The combination of credential harvesting, decryption of protected data, writing to files named after the user, and exfiltration to attacker-controlled webhooks is a classic pattern of credential-stealing malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
