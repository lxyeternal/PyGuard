      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the package description, indicating potential malicious intent. The use of subprocess to run hidden PowerShell commands during the setup process (package installation) without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. Overall, the code exhibits multiple high-risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and suspicious domain references, confirming it is malicious."
