      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly obfuscated payload embedded in the install command of the setup script, which is executed during package installation without user consent. Specifically, the class InstallCommand subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to decode a long obfuscated string by XORing it with a numeric key string, reconstructing Python code that is then executed dynamically via eval(compile(...)). This pattern of obfuscated payload reconstruction and immediate dynamic execution during package installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution malware. The obfuscation and suppression of exceptions (empty except block) further indicate an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, and the code executes arbitrary code at install time, which is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malicious intent."
