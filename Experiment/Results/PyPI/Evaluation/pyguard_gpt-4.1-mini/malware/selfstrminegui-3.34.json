      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade detection by static analysis. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during the setup script execution is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The rest of the setup code appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, encoded PowerShell payload, execution during package installation, and obfuscation, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
