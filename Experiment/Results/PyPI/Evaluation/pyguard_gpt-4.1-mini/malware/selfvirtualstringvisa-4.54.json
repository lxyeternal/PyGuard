      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64 string that, when decoded, likely contains a command to invoke a web request to a suspicious domain ('cdn.discordapp.com') to download and execute a file named 'Esquele.exe' in a hidden window. This behavior is consistent with remote payload retrieval and execution, a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The malicious payload execution is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing code execution during package installation without user consent. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command with encoded payload, combined with suppression of exceptions, further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a potentially malicious executable from an external source during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
