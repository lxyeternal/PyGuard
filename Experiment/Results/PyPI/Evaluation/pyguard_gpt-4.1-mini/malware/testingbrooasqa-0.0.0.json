      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding, including hex-encoded strings, base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and dynamic evaluation via eval and exec. It dynamically imports modules and decodes large blocks of data that are subsequently executed as code. The code uses indirect and obfuscated function and variable names, making static analysis difficult. Such patterns—especially the use of eval on decompressed and decoded data, dynamic imports, and execution of hidden payloads—are classic indicators of malicious intent. The code likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading and executing further payloads, exfiltrating data, or establishing persistence without user consent. The absence of any legitimate application logic, combined with the obfuscation and dynamic code execution, strongly indicates that this code is malicious."
