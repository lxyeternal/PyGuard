      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a conditional execution pattern often used by malware to avoid repeated execution or detection. This execution happens during the import or setup phase without any user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Given these factors and the known risk indicators (hidden PowerShell execution, encoded commands, execution during setup, conditional directory check), this code is malicious."
