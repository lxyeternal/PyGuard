      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. First, it performs an unsolicited HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL with a suspicious payload immediately upon import, without any user interaction or consent. This is a classic data exfiltration or signaling behavior. Second, it uses obfuscated code: a base64-encoded string is decoded and executed dynamically via exec(), which is a critical red flag for arbitrary code execution. The decoded payload imports cryptographic libraries and executes further obfuscated code, indicating attempts to hide malicious intent. Third, this execution occurs within the setup script, meaning the malicious code runs during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The combination of network communication to a suspicious external endpoint, obfuscated dynamic code execution, and execution triggered during installation without user consent matches multiple high-risk and critical risk patterns associated exclusively with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is highly obfuscated and uses multiple layers of base64 decoding and exec calls to execute hidden payloads. It imports the 'requests' library and performs an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is a common exfiltration or command-and-control technique. The payload is encoded in base64 and executed dynamically, indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent and evade static analysis. The use of exec on decoded data, combined with network communication to a suspicious external endpoint without user interaction or consent, strongly indicates malicious behavior. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hardcoded suspicious URLs, and dynamic code execution, all of which are hallmarks of malware."
