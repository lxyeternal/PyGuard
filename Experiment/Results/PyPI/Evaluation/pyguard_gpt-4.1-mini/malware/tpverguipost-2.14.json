      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and if it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated and likely downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and runs it silently (hidden window). This pattern of hidden execution with encoded PowerShell commands is a hallmark of malware aiming to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution during package installation without user consent. The use of a suspicious domain, obfuscation, silent failure handling (empty except blocks), and execution of hidden shell commands strongly indicate malicious intent."
