      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded command is base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed without user consent or interaction. The code first checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' and only executes the hidden PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command string is unusual and likely intended to evade detection. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code is embedded in installation scripts. The entire subprocess call is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses all exceptions, further indicating an attempt to hide failures and avoid detection. Based on the knowledge points, the use of hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands during package setup, the presence of suspicious directory checks, and obfuscated payload execution are definitive indicators of malicious intent."
