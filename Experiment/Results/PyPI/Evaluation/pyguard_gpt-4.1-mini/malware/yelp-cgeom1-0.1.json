      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that collects system information such as the originating IP address, hostname, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (hj4r3z33cahfqit5kmmh1mgn3e95x4lt.oastify.com), which is not related to the package's stated purpose or any known legitimate service. This data exfiltration occurs automatically during the package installation process, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of a custom install command subclassing setuptools.command.install to perform network communication and data exfiltration during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, no user notification or consent, and the external URL is suspicious and likely attacker-controlled. These factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including unsolicited environment discovery, data exfiltration to a hardcoded suspicious endpoint, and execution of network communication during package installation without user consent."
