      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens silently without user consent or interaction, and the subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide the window. Such behavior is a hallmark of malware, often used to download or execute further malicious payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the system. Additionally, the setup() call with a suspicious package name 'hackedpost' and author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests malicious intent, possibly as part of a supply chain attack or malicious package installation. The silent exception handling (except: pass) suppresses errors, which is typical in malware to avoid raising suspicion. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup strongly indicates malicious activity."
