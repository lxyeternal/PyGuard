      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads or executes content from a suspicious URL (cdndiscardapp.com) that is unrelated to the stated purpose of the package. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens during the setup process, which is a classic supply chain attack vector to run malicious code during package installation without user consent. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The author and email fields appear suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated remote code during installation, which is a hallmark of malware."
