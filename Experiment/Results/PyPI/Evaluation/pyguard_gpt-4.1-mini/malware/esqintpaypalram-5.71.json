      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, suppressing any visible window, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The command downloads and runs a payload from a suspicious GitHub raw URL (https://github.com/T4Hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe), which is unrelated to the stated package purpose and is a strong indicator of remote payload retrieval and execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution occurs during the import or setup phase without user consent or interaction, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate setup script for a Python package, further indicating an attempt to hide malicious behavior within an otherwise normal-looking package installation process. All these factors combined strongly indicate that the code is malicious."
