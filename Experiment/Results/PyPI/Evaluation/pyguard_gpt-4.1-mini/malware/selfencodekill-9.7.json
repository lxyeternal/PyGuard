      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a conditional execution pattern often used by malware to avoid repeated execution or detection. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution without user consent or interaction. Additionally, the author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and the commented URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, which may be used to mask failures or detection. Overall, the combination of stealthy PowerShell execution, obfuscation, conditional execution, and silent error handling in a setup script strongly indicates this code is malicious."
