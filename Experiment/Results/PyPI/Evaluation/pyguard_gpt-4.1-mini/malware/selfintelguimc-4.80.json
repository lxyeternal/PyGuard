      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window, a common malware tactic. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' (a privacy-focused email provider) adds to suspicion. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a cover or delivery mechanism. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated, hidden execution of a PowerShell payload during package installation without user consent, use of encoded commands to evade static analysis, and conditional execution based on filesystem state. These behaviors align with known malware patterns, including supply chain attacks and stealthy payload deployment."
