      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malware. The use of obfuscated class names, hardcoded cryptographic keys, and encrypted payloads further confirms the intent to hide malicious actions. The code executes arbitrary code during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, system compromise, or further payload delivery. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious Python code, including arbitrary code execution during install, obfuscation, and use of cryptography to hide payloads."
