      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user consent or interaction, and is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded payload strongly indicates malicious intent."
