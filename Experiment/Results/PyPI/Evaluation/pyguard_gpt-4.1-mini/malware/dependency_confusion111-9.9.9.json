      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a Python package setup script that executes code during installation, development setup, and egg info generation by subclassing setuptools commands. It collects sensitive environment information including the package name, hostname, current user, and current working directory, then encodes this data as JSON, converts it to a hex string, splits it into chunks, and sends these chunks as DNS queries to a hardcoded external domain 'uchpuchmak.lol' via a custom DNS request function. This behavior constitutes covert data exfiltration of system and user information without user consent or notification. The use of DNS queries for data transmission is a known evasion technique to bypass network monitoring. The code triggers this exfiltration automatically during package installation or development setup, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. Although the package description claims it is for research and not malicious, the actual behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware: execution of code at install time, collection and encoding of sensitive environment data, transmission to a suspicious external domain, and lack of user interaction or consent. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware embedded in a Python package installation process."
