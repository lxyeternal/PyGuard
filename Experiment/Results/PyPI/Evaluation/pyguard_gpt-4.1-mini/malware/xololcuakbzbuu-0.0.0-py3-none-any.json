      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and multiple string replacements to hide its true intent. It decodes a large base64-encoded payload and executes it dynamically using exec(). This pattern of decoding and executing obfuscated code is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it is commonly used to conceal malware payloads and evade static analysis. The code does not contain any user interaction or legitimate application logic, and the use of exec on decoded data is a critical red flag. Given the extensive obfuscation and dynamic execution, this code likely performs unauthorized or harmful actions, such as downloading and executing further malicious payloads, exfiltrating data, or establishing persistence. Therefore, it should be classified as malicious."
