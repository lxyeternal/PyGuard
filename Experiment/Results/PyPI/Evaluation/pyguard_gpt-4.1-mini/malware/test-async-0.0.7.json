      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: it performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL (https://pastebin.com/raw/3xcr2My4), then immediately sends a POST request to the URL obtained from that GET request with a JSON payload containing a message ('new run @everyone'), which suggests unsolicited communication or spamming. It then generates a random filename and downloads code from another suspicious URL (https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode), writes this code directly to a local file with a random name and a .pyw extension, and immediately executes this file via subprocess.Popen with shell=True. This sequence of downloading and executing remote code without user consent or validation is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling arbitrary code execution and potential system compromise. Furthermore, this code is embedded in a setuptools setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The absence of any user interaction, validation, or logging, combined with the use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, random file naming to evade detection, and immediate execution of downloaded code, confirms the code is malicious."
