      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and runs it as a hidden process. This occurs conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a staging or evasion technique. The use of an obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell command embedded in a setup script (distutils.core.setup) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') along with the suspicious URL and hidden execution further support malicious intent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a potentially malicious payload during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
