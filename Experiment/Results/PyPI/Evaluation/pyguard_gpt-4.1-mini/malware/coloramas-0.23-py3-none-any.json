      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It collects sensitive files related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet from the user's roaming appdata directory and other common user folders (Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It compresses these files into a zip archive without user consent or notification. Then, it gathers the victim's public IP address and country code via external HTTP requests. The code constructs a message including the username and country flag, and exfiltrates both the message and the zip archive to a hardcoded Telegram bot API endpoint using a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. This is a classic pattern of credential or wallet theft malware that silently collects sensitive wallet data and sends it to an attacker-controlled Telegram channel. The use of hardcoded Telegram bot credentials, silent exception suppression, targeting of sensitive wallet files, and immediate network exfiltration without user interaction or legitimate application logic are strong indicators of malicious intent. The code also deletes the zip archive after sending to cover tracks (self-deleting behavior). All these factors combined confirm that this code is malicious."
