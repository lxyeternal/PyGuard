      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution window. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) and a non-standard package name 'libmcencodeed' with a misleading description further suggests an attempt to disguise malicious intent within a package setup script. The use of subprocess to run obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands on Windows systems during package installation or execution, which is a critical risk and a hallmark of malware."
