      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) which appears to be a remote executable download and execution attempt. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens during the package setup process (in setup.py), which is a known supply chain attack vector to run malicious code during package installation without user consent. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and the commented URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) further suggest malicious intent. The use of try-except blocks suppresses any errors, hiding failures and avoiding detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a remote payload during package installation, a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks."
