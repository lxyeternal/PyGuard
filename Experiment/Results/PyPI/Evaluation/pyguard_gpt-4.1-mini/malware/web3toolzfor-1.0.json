      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a hardcoded base64-encoded URL that points to a Discord webhook, which is a common technique for obfuscation and evasion. It then searches for Steam-related files (ssfn* files and config directory) in the Program Files (x86) Steam folder, packages these files into a zip archive in the TEMP directory, and immediately sends this archive via HTTP POST to the decoded webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration, targeting potentially sensitive Steam session and configuration files. The use of a Discord webhook for data exfiltration, combined with silent file collection and transmission, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to delete the zip file afterward to cover its tracks, which is a typical anti-forensics technique. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding these actions, confirming that this code is designed to stealthily steal and exfiltrate user data."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It decodes a hardcoded base64 string that reveals a suspicious external URL (a Discord webhook URL), which is commonly used for covert data exfiltration. The script checks for the existence of a specific directory in the user's AppData Roaming folder (\\Exodus), which is likely to contain sensitive user data such as wallet or application files. It then copies this directory to a temporary location, compresses it into a zip archive, and sends the archive via an HTTP POST request to the decoded external webhook URL without any user consent or interaction. After sending, it attempts to delete the temporary files silently, indicating anti-forensics behavior. The combination of targeting user-specific sensitive directories, packaging data, and exfiltrating it to a hardcoded external webhook URL without user knowledge or legitimate application logic is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. There is no benign justification for this pattern, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators such as use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, environment discovery, data exfiltration, and silent cleanup."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports multiple modules with suspicious names such as 'metamask', 'discord', 'exodus', 'machine', 'web3toolzfor.passwords_cards_cookies', 'steam', 'screenshot', and 'telegram'. These names strongly suggest functionality related to credential or token theft (e.g., 'metamask' and 'discord' tokens), system information gathering ('machineinfo'), and possibly screenshot capture and Telegram communication for exfiltration or command and control. The function 'stha' attempts to import and execute functions from these modules, suppressing exceptions to avoid detection. The code then immediately spawns a background thread to run this function, indicating stealthy, automated execution without user interaction or consent. The pattern of importing modules with names associated with credential stealing, token finding, system info gathering, and exfiltration, combined with silent exception handling and background threading, matches multiple high-risk and critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including credential theft, information exfiltration, and stealth execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction evident, and the code structure is consistent with malware loaders or stealers that run covertly in the background."

It then exfiltrates these tokens by sending them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is base64-decoded within the code. This behavior matches classic indicators of credential theft and data exfiltration malware: it accesses sensitive user data without consent, uses obfuscated (base64-encoded) external endpoints, performs no user interaction or notification, and immediately sends stolen tokens to an attacker-controlled server. The use of environment variables to locate user-specific directories, scanning of multiple application data paths, and direct network transmission of sensitive tokens to a suspicious webhook endpoint are strong indicators of malicious intent."

It then archives these copied directories into zip files and uploads them via HTTP POST to the decoded webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscated URL, targeting sensitive user directories, silent exception handling, and automatic data exfiltration to an external endpoint are classic hallmarks of information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification, and the code is designed to stealthily collect and send potentially sensitive browser extension data to a remote attacker-controlled server."

The use of a hardcoded external URL (Discord webhook) for data exfiltration, combined with the silent capture and transmission of potentially sensitive user screen content, is a classic indicator of malicious behavior. Additionally, the code attempts to delete the screenshot file afterward to cover its tracks, which is a common anti-forensics technique. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding these actions, and the obfuscation of the webhook URL via base64 encoding further suggests an intent to evade detection. These factors collectively indicate that the code is designed for unauthorized data exfiltration and is therefore malicious."

The use of base64 encoding to hide the webhook URL, the targeting of sensitive user data without user consent, the silent exception handling to avoid detection, and the immediate network transmission of potentially sensitive files are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior aligns with typical data exfiltration malware patterns, especially targeting user credentials or session information.

      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a clear example of malicious behavior, specifically a credential and sensitive data stealer targeting multiple Chromium-based browsers on Windows. It enumerates installed browsers by checking known browser data paths, then extracts sensitive information such as saved passwords, cookies, credit card data, browsing history, and download history from browser profile databases. It uses Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData) to decrypt the master encryption key and AES-GCM to decrypt stored passwords and other encrypted data. The stolen data is saved into temporary files under the user's AppData Local Temp directory, then compressed into a zip archive. Finally, the archive is exfiltrated via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, base64-obfuscated Discord webhook URL (a suspicious external endpoint). The code performs all these actions without any user interaction or consent, silently collecting and sending highly sensitive personal data to an attacker-controlled server. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including credential theft, data exfiltration, use of DPAPI decryption outside legitimate contexts, hardcoded suspicious URLs, and no legitimate application logic. Therefore, this code is malicious."

It then encodes this information into a JSON payload and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is base64-encoded and decoded at runtime to obscure the destination. This behavior is a classic example of information-stealing malware that performs system fingerprinting and exfiltrates sensitive host data to an external, attacker-controlled server. The use of a hardcoded, obfuscated webhook URL for data exfiltration, absence of legitimate application logic or user notification, and immediate outbound network communication with sensitive system details are strong indicators of malicious intent. According to the provided knowledge points, unsolicited collection and transmission of detailed OS and hardware information to a hardcoded external endpoint, especially with obfuscation (base64 encoding of the webhook URL), is a critical risk and hallmark of malware."
