      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution window. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of an encoded PowerShell command strongly indicate an attempt to download or execute a malicious payload without user consent or interaction. Additionally, this execution is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing code execution during package installation. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during setup confirms the code is malicious."
