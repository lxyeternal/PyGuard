      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of malware. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or ensure persistence. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution occurs within a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing arbitrary code execution during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden execution of a PowerShell command during package setup, with no user consent or validation, is a definitive indicator of malicious intent."
