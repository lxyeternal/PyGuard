      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: it performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL (https://pastebin.com/raw/3xcr2My4), then immediately sends a POST request to the URL obtained from that GET request with a JSON payload containing a spam-like message ('new run @everyone'), which suggests unauthorized use of a webhook or similar endpoint for spamming or notification without user consent. It then generates a random filename and downloads code from another suspicious URL (https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode), writes this code directly to a file with a random name and .pyw extension, and immediately executes it via subprocess.Popen with shell=True. This sequence of downloading and executing remote code without validation or user interaction is a classic remote code execution and payload delivery pattern, commonly used in malware and supply chain attacks. The malicious actions are embedded in the setup script, which means they will trigger during package installation, a known vector for supply chain attacks. The author metadata ('hacker') and the lack of legitimate application logic around these network and execution actions further support the malicious classification. Overall, this code downloads and executes untrusted code from external sources, performs unsolicited network communication, and runs arbitrary payloads without user consent, which is highly indicative of malicious intent."
