      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to run custom code during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. In the overridden run() method, it collects system information including hostname, current working directory, and username without user consent. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io), which is not related to the package's stated purpose. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: execution of network communication during install without user interaction, exfiltration of system-specific data to an external, non-corporate domain, and embedding malicious behavior in the setup.py install hook. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code is malicious and likely part of a supply chain attack or information-stealing malware."
