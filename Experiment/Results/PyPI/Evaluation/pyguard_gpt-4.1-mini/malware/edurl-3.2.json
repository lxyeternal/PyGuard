      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then launches this hidden PowerShell process without user consent or interaction. This behavior is consistent with malware that tries to execute hidden payloads during package installation or runtime. Additionally, the malicious code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, combined with the silent exception handling, strongly indicates malicious intent."
