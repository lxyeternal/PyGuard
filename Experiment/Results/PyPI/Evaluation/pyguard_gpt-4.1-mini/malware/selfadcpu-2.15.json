      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a conditional execution pattern often used by malware to avoid repeated execution or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. The use of subprocess to run hidden PowerShell commands with encoded payloads during package setup is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, which is typical in malicious setup scripts to avoid raising suspicion. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated payload during installation without user consent or interaction, which is a critical indicator of malicious intent."
