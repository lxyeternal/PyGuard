      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware (stealer). It collects sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, credit card information, Roblox cookies, Minecraft files, and system information (e.g., Windows key, hardware UUID, IP geolocation). It decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption, indicating credential theft. The code exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded suspicious external URL (https://kekwltd.ru/relay/bluescreen) via HTTP POST requests, including Discord webhooks, which is a common C2/exfiltration method. It also attempts to persist by copying itself to the Windows startup folder and can kill Discord-related processes to avoid detection or interference. The code includes clipboard hijacking functionality that replaces cryptocurrency wallet addresses in the clipboard with attacker-controlled addresses, a known theft technique. It performs environment and VM detection to evade analysis. The code uses obfuscated function and variable names, suppresses exceptions, and runs multiple threads for stealthy background data collection and exfiltration. It downloads and installs multiple Python packages dynamically, which can be abused for malicious purposes. The presence of hardcoded suspicious URLs, extensive credential harvesting, persistence mechanisms, and data exfiltration without user consent confirms the code is malicious."
