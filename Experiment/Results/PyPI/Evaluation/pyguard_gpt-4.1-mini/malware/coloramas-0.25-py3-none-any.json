      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It silently collects sensitive files related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet from the user's roaming appdata directory and common user folders (Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It compresses these files into a ZIP archive without user consent or notification. Then, it gathers the victim's public IP address and country code via external HTTP requests. The code constructs a message including the username and country flag, and exfiltrates both the message and the ZIP archive to a hardcoded Telegram bot API endpoint using a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. The use of hardcoded Telegram bot credentials and chat ID for data exfiltration, combined with the targeting of sensitive wallet files, is a strong indicator of credential theft or asset theft malware. The code suppresses exceptions to avoid detection and deletes the ZIP archive after sending, indicating anti-forensics behavior. There is no legitimate application logic, user interaction, or notification, and the network communication is to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint. These factors collectively confirm the code is malicious."
