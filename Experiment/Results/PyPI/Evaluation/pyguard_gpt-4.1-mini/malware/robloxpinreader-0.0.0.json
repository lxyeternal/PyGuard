      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding, including hex escapes, base64 decoding, and zlib decompression, followed by dynamic execution via eval and exec. It uses indirect and confusing variable names and dynamic imports to hide its intent. The code decodes a large base64-encoded and compressed payload, then executes it dynamically, which is a classic hallmark of malware attempting to evade static analysis. The presence of eval on decompressed data, dynamic imports, and execution of decoded payloads strongly indicates arbitrary code execution capabilities. Such behavior is typical of malicious code designed to download, decrypt, and execute further payloads or perform unauthorized actions without user consent. The obfuscation and execution patterns match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and evasion techniques. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
