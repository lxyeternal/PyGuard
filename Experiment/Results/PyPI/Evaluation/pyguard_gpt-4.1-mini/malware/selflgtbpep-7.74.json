      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is launched via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, suppressing any visible window, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The command is executed conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests staging or persistence behavior. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package repository or known software. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover, as it defines a seemingly benign package, but the actual malicious payload is executed before it. The use of subprocess to run encoded PowerShell commands during package setup or installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands on Windows systems during package installation or execution, which is a hallmark of malware."
