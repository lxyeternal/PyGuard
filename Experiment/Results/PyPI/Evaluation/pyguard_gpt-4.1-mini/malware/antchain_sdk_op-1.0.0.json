      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command in setup.py, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. During installation, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username without user consent. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io), which is not related to the package's stated purpose. This behavior is consistent with system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server. The network communication occurs silently during package installation, without user interaction or notification, which is a hallmark of malicious activity. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard URL for data exfiltration combined with execution during install time classifies this as a supply chain attack vector and confirms malicious intent."
