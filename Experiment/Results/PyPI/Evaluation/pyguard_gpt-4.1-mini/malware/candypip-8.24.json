      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command, which likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further malicious payloads. This execution happens silently during the package setup process without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command with encoded payload and hidden window style is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. The combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered conditionally during installation, with no error handling or user notification, matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware."
