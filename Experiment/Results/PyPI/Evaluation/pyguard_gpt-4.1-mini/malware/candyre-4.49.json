      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or analysis. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call from distutils.core, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded payload in the same script strongly indicates malicious intent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including stealthy execution, obfuscation, and execution during package installation."
