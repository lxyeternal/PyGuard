      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. This code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, and the encoded command likely downloads or executes further malicious payloads from a suspicious URL (the decoded command references 'dl.dropbox.com' and a suspicious executable). All these factors combined strongly indicate that this code is malicious."
