      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This means arbitrary code is executed at install time without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of encrypted payload and exec() to run it is a strong indicator of obfuscation and malicious intent. The code is embedded in the setup.py install hook, which is a known technique for malware to execute code during package installation. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) further suggests potential for remote code execution or data exfiltration. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description strings also indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious Python packages that execute arbitrary code during installation."
