      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains a base64-encoded payload embedded as a commented-out exec statement within the setup script of a Python package. This payload, when decoded, performs the following suspicious actions: it imports the 'requests' and 'os' modules, makes an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded suspicious URL (https://pastebin.com/raw/hEF5HaFc), sets custom headers including a User-Agent mimicking a browser, reads the response content, writes it to a file named 'pkg_installer.exe', and then executes this file via a shell command. This sequence is a classic pattern of downloading and executing a remote payload without user consent, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior. Embedding such code in a setup script is a known supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of base64 encoding to hide the payload, the hardcoded external URL unrelated to the package's stated purpose, and the execution of a downloaded executable file all strongly indicate malicious intent."
