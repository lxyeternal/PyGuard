      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malware. The obfuscated class name, the use of encrypted payload, and execution during package installation are all hallmarks of malicious intent. Additionally, the package name 'etheurm' is a likely typo-squatting attempt on 'ethereum', which is a common tactic to trick users. The code does not perform any legitimate application logic around the network or execution actions, and the encrypted payload likely contains further malicious code. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
