      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools' install command to override the run() method, which executes during package installation. Inside run(), it checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code via exec() on data decrypted by Fernet with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user consent is a critical risk and a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during installation strongly indicates an attempt to run arbitrary malicious code on the victim's machine during package installation. The presence of network-related modules (requests) suggests potential network activity, possibly for payload retrieval or data exfiltration, although the exact decrypted payload is not visible here. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful code during installation, which is a hallmark of malicious Python packages."
