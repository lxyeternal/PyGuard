      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute a reverse shell payload immediately upon package installation. Specifically, it constructs a Python one-liner reverse shell command that connects to a hardcoded external IP address (121.4.154.240) on port 4501, duplicates the socket file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, disables shell history logging, and spawns a bash shell. This command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via a shell command during the install process. This behavior enables unauthorized remote code execution and remote control of the victim's machine without user consent or interaction, which is a classic hallmark of malware, specifically a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor. The embedding of this payload in the package installation process (setup.py) is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of hardcoded IP, base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload, and immediate execution during install are all strong indicators of malicious intent."
