      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class (GruppeInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This decrypted payload is not visible in the source, indicating obfuscation and hiding of the true payload. Executing decrypted code at install time without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of dynamic imports, encrypted payload, and execution during package installation (setup.py) is a hallmark of malware aiming for remote code execution and persistence. The package metadata is obfuscated and meaningless, further suggesting malicious intent. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during installation."
