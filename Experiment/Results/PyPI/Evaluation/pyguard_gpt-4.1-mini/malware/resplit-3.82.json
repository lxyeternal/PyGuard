      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution to evade analysis or repeated execution. This behavior is embedded in the setup script, which means it triggers during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, without user consent or interaction, and the suppression of exceptions to avoid detection, strongly indicates malicious intent. The rest of the setup call appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
