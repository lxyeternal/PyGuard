      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known vector for executing arbitrary code during package installation (a supply chain attack pattern). Inside the overridden run() method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This dynamic execution of decrypted payload at install time without user consent is a critical risk and a hallmark of malware. The payload is obfuscated and hidden inside the install process, which is a common evasion technique. The package name 'requstss' is suspiciously similar to 'requests' (typosquatting). The use of cryptography to decrypt and execute code during installation strongly indicates malicious intent, as legitimate packages rarely do this. The code also restricts execution to Windows (os.name == 'nt'), which is typical for targeted malware. Overall, this is a classic example of a malicious Python package designed to execute hidden payloads during installation, consistent with supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution malware."
