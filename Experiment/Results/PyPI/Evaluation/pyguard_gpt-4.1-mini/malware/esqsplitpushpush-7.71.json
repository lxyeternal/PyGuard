      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that invokes a web request to a suspicious GitHub raw URL (https://github.com/T4Hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and executes it silently without user consent or interaction. This behavior is consistent with remote payload retrieval and execution, a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The subprocess.Popen call uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The presence of this code inside a setup script (which runs during package installation) suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes automatically upon package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, remote code download and execution, and execution during package installation without user consent."
