      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute arbitrary code during installation without user consent. The run() method checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. The payload is obfuscated and encrypted, hiding its true intent, which is a common malware technique to evade detection. The package name 'Matplorlib' is a typoquatting attempt on the legitimate 'matplotlib' package, a known tactic for supply chain attacks. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only for this malicious payload execution. The code executes this payload silently during installation, without any user interaction or notification, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, use of cryptography to hide payload, and execution of decrypted code via exec(). Therefore, this code is malicious."
