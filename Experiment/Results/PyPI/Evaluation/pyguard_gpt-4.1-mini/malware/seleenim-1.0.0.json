      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing obfuscated and encrypted code at install time without user consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages. The use of encrypted payloads and exec() in setup/install scripts is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. Additionally, the package name 'seleenim' is suspiciously similar to the legitimate 'selenium' package, which may indicate typosquatting to trick users. The encrypted payload and the use of network-related modules (requests) inside the install hook strongly suggest that the code is designed to fetch or execute malicious code silently during installation. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, and use of cryptography to hide payloads."
