      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads or executes content from a suspicious URL (cdndiscardapp.com) unrelated to the stated package purpose. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory ('tahg') before executing the payload, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or repeated execution. This execution occurs during the package setup process, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution without user consent. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags to hide the window further confirms stealthy behavior. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, suspicious external URL, and execution during installation strongly classifies this code as malicious."
