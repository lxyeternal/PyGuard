      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a binary executable from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://github-bebra.s3.filebase.com/node) without any user interaction or validation, writes it to a temporary directory (/tmp/node), sets executable permissions, and immediately executes it. Additionally, it writes a configuration file with a hardcoded mining pool IP address (144.76.245.112:22221) and mining-related settings, indicating the likely deployment of a cryptocurrency miner. This download-and-execute pattern from an untrusted external source, combined with silent execution during package setup, is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, often seen in supply chain attacks or malware distribution. The absence of user consent, lack of validation, use of a suspicious external URL, writing and running executables in temporary directories, and execution triggered during package installation all strongly indicate malicious intent."
