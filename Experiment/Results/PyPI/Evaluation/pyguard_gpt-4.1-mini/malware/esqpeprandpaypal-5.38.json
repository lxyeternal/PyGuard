      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command downloads and executes a binary from a suspicious GitHub raw URL (https://github.com/T4Hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) without any user interaction or consent. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens at import or setup time, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the malicious payload execution is hidden before it. The domain and author information appear suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command with encoded payload and hidden window style is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a remote payload during package installation or import, which is a critical security risk."
