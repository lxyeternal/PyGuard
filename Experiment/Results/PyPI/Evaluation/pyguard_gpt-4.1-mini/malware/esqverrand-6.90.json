      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package. The setup() call appears to be a decoy to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installation script. This pattern of executing obfuscated PowerShell commands during package installation without user consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
