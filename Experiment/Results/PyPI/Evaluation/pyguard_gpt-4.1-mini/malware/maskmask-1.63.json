      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or to detect analysis environments. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in a setup script context, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command in this manner is suspicious and consistent with malware behavior. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is malicious."
