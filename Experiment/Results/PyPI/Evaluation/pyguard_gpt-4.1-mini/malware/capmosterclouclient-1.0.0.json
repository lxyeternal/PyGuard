      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class (GruppeInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is hardcoded and decrypted with a hardcoded key, then executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag for arbitrary code execution. This execution happens silently during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated encrypted payloads in setup/install scripts, dynamic imports of network libraries, and execution of decrypted code at install time strongly indicate malicious intent. The package metadata fields (name, author, description) are nonsensical or obfuscated, further suggesting an attempt to hide malicious activity. Overall, this pattern matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk indicators of malware, including arbitrary code execution during installation, obfuscation, and use of cryptography to hide payloads."
