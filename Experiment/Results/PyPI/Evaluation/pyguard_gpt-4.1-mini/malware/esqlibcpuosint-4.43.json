      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or analysis environments. The URL embedded in the comment and the encoded command points to a suspicious domain (esquelesquad.rip), which is unrelated to any legitimate Python package or library. This execution happens during the package setup process without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. The rest of the setup code appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. All these factors combined strongly indicate that this code is malicious."
