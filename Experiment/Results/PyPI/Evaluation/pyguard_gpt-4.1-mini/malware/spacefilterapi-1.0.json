      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious credential stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and other sensitive user data. It collects Discord tokens from various browsers and Discord clients by scanning local storage files and decrypting encrypted data using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption. It also extracts saved passwords and cookies from browsers by copying and reading SQLite databases, decrypting stored credentials. The code gathers detailed user environment information such as IP address, geolocation, username, and Discord user badges, then exfiltrates all collected data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. It uploads stolen data and files to anonymous file hosting services and sends formatted messages with sensitive information to the attacker-controlled webhook. The code uses threading to perform concurrent data collection and exfiltration, kills browser and Telegram processes to access locked files, and uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 decoding and encrypted payloads. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, automated credential extraction, decryption of protected data, and silent network exfiltration without user consent are definitive indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
