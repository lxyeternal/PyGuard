      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that executes automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. It creates a directory inside the Windows Startup folder for the current user, which is a known persistence mechanism to run code on system startup. It then clones a GitHub repository (https://github.com/dcsage/test2lmaos.git) into this hidden startup directory. After cloning, it moves a Python script (test.py) from the cloned repository into the Startup folder, presumably to be executed on user login. This behavior is characteristic of malware establishing persistence by placing executable scripts in startup locations. The use of a hardcoded external GitHub URL to fetch code during installation, combined with writing to a sensitive user directory (Startup folder) without user consent, strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification, and the code executes arbitrary network and file system operations during package installation, which is a common supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code exhibits critical risk malicious behavior."
