      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, during installation, collects all environment variables from the host system and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://ea2de72474be.ngrok.app) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes automated data exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment information during package installation, which is a classic hallmark of malicious activity and supply chain attack vectors. The use of a hardcoded ngrok domain for data exfiltration, embedding this behavior in the install hook, and the absence of legitimate application logic or user notification strongly indicate malicious intent."
