      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe') during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. It writes this executable directly to disk and immediately executes it using 'os.system' with the 'start' command on Windows platforms. This pattern—downloading and executing a remote binary during installation—is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which can hide failures or detection. The use of a post-install hook in setuptools to trigger this behavior further indicates an attempt to execute malicious payloads as part of the package installation, a known high-risk and critical indicator of malicious intent."
