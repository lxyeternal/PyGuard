      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded command is base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed without user consent or interaction. The code first checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' and only runs the payload if it does not exist, indicating a persistence or evasion mechanism. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The execution of encoded PowerShell commands in a setup script context (during package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The use of try-except blocks suppresses any errors, further hiding malicious activity. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute an obfuscated payload during package setup, which is a hallmark of malware."
