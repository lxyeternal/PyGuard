      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of encrypted payload and exec() obscures the actual malicious code, evading static analysis. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) in the install hook further suggests potential for downloading or executing further malicious code or exfiltrating data. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description strings add to the suspicion. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including code execution at install time, obfuscation, and use of cryptography to hide payloads."
