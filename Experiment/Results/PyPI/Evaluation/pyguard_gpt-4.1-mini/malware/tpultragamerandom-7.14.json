      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common method to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest suspicious or attacker-controlled identifiers. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during the setup script execution is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is used as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution triggered during package installation."
