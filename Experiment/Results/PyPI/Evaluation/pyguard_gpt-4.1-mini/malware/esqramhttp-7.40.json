      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution window. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or non-legitimate source. The malicious payload is embedded in the setup script, which means it will execute during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess to run encoded PowerShell commands in a hidden window without error handling or user notification is a strong indicator of malware. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute potentially harmful commands on Windows systems during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
