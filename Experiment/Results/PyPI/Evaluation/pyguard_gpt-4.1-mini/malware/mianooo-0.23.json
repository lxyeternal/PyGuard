      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py install hook). It collects the hostname and IP address of the host machine using socket calls, then asynchronously sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of system information. The webhook URL is hardcoded and external, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Executing network communication during installation, especially sending system identifiers to an external endpoint, is a known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with information stealing and unauthorized data exfiltration during package installation."
