      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses any exceptions, indicating an attempt to hide execution failures. The check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests conditional execution to evade analysis or ensure environment readiness. The use of distutils setup with a suspicious package name and author email linked to 'EsqueleSquad' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' further supports malicious intent. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, obfuscated payload delivery, execution during package installation, and lack of user consent or transparency, all hallmark signs of malware."
