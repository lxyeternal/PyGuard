      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It silently collects sensitive user data such as the current username, public IP address, ISP, and country information without user consent. It checks for the presence of cryptocurrency wallet extensions (Metamask, Exodus, Ledger) and Telegram Desktop data, indicating targeting of financial and communication assets. The script copies the victim's Exodus wallet data from the roaming AppData directory to a temporary location, compresses it into a zip archive, and sends this archive to a hardcoded Telegram bot via the Telegram Bot API, effectively exfiltrating sensitive wallet configuration files. It also takes a screenshot of the victim's desktop and sends it to the same Telegram chat, along with system information, further invading privacy. If Telegram Desktop data is present, it zips and exfiltrates the Telegram session files, which can allow attackers to hijack the victim's Telegram account. The use of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID for data exfiltration, absence of user interaction or consent, silent exception handling, and targeting of sensitive directories are strong indicators of malicious intent. The script terminates immediately after attempting data exfiltration, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. Overall, this code is a credential and data stealer designed to harvest cryptocurrency wallet data and Telegram sessions, then exfiltrate them to an attacker-controlled Telegram channel."
