      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of string replacements and base64 decoding, followed by execution via exec(). This is a classic technique to hide malicious intent. The code dynamically reconstructs a large payload string, decodes it from base64, and executes it without any user interaction or consent. Such behavior is a strong indicator of malicious activity, as it allows arbitrary code execution while evading static analysis. The obfuscation and immediate execution of decoded data strongly suggest that the code is designed to conceal harmful operations, which may include downloading further payloads, exfiltrating data, or establishing persistence. This pattern aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and lack of transparency or legitimate application logic."
