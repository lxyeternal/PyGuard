      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It hooks into the package installation process by subclassing setuptools.command.install.install and overriding the run() method to execute custom code during installation without user consent. It enumerates files under a system directory (/Library/Application Support) with a specific pattern, then uses a cryptographic hash-based generator to check for a specific byte sequence (VAR3). Upon a match, it downloads a payload from obfuscated, hardcoded URLs that differ based on the CPU architecture (x86_64 or arm64). The URLs themselves are XOR-obfuscated with keys derived from cryptographic hashes, indicating an attempt to hide the destination. The downloaded content is XOR-decrypted with a generated key and saved as an executable binary named 'donothing' in the user's ~/.local/bin directory, which is created if missing. The binary is then made executable and launched silently via subprocess.Popen with stdout and stderr redirected to DEVNULL, indicating stealth execution. This sequence—silent download and execution of a remote binary during package installation, use of obfuscation to hide URLs and keys, writing executables to user directories, and execution without user interaction—is a classic supply chain attack pattern and is strongly associated with malware. The code lacks any legitimate application logic or user notification, uses obfuscation to evade detection, and performs network communication to suspicious endpoints. Therefore, this code is malicious."
