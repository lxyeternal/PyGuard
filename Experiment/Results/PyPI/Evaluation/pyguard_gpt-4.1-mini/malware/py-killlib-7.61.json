      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. This execution happens at import or setup time without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. The presence of a suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further supports the malicious intent. Overall, this code uses obfuscation, stealth execution, and installation-time code execution to deliver a hidden payload, which is a strong indicator of malware."
