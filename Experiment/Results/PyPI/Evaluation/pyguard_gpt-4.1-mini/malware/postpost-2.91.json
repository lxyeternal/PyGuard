      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist before launching this hidden PowerShell process, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. Such behavior is a hallmark of malicious code, often used for payload delivery, persistence, or further compromise. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of this hidden, encoded PowerShell execution in the setup context strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism."
