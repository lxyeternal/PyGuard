      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that, during package installation, automatically downloads a Python script named 'rat.py' from a hardcoded, suspicious URL hosted on Discord's CDN. It writes this file directly to disk without any validation or user consent. The code also ensures installation of dependencies 'requests' and 'pycryptodome' dynamically via subprocess calls. The package entry point references 'spamsynonym.rat:main', implying that the downloaded 'rat.py' script is intended to be executed as part of the package functionality. This pattern—downloading and writing executable code from an external, untrusted source during installation, combined with dynamic dependency installation and execution—is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The absence of user interaction, validation, or transparency, and the use of a non-standard, hardcoded URL for fetching executable code, strongly indicate malicious intent."
