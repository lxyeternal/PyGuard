      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The command is launched only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated detection or analysis. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package repository. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of arbitrary code during package installation. The subprocess.Popen call uses creationflags to hide the window, further indicating stealthy behavior. Overall, this code is designed to execute an obfuscated remote or local payload covertly during installation, which is a hallmark of malware."
