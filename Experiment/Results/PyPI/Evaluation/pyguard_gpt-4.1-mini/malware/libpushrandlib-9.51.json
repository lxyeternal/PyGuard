      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated PowerShell payloads stealthily. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the payload if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled identity. This execution happens at import time or setup time without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. The combination of hidden PowerShell execution, encoded commands, conditional directory checks, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent, consistent with known malware patterns for stealthy code execution and potential further payload delivery."
