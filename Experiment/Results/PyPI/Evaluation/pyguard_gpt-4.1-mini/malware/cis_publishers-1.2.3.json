      "malicious_behavior": "The code embeds malicious behavior in the package installation process by subclassing setuptools' install command and registering a post-install function (_post_install) that executes automatically after installation without user consent. This function collects sensitive environment information including the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (via os.uname()), and the absolute path of the package file. It then encodes this information in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain (https://kotko.org) with a query parameter constructed from hardcoded strings and the encoded data. Additionally, it writes a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with a suspicious message, which serves no legitimate purpose. The network communication to an external, non-standard domain combined with environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector. The absence of user interaction, obfuscation of intent by embedding this in setup.py install hooks, and the use of base64 encoding for exfiltration strongly indicate malicious intent."
