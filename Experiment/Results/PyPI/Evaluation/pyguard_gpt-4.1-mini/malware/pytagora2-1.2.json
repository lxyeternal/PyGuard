      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function 'hello' that executes a base64-decoded payload using exec(). The decoded payload creates a socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (172.16.60.80) on port 9009, receives data from the socket, and executes the received data dynamically. This behavior is a classic indicator of a remote code execution backdoor or reverse shell. The use of base64 encoding to hide the payload, dynamic execution of received data, and network connection to a hardcoded IP without user interaction or consent are strong indicators of malicious intent. Such patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are used to gain unauthorized remote control over the host system."
