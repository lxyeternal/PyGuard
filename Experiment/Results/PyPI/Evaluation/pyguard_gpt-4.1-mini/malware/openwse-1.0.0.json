      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is embedded in the package installation process to execute hidden payloads. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during installation strongly indicates intent to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions. The code also specifies Windows as the target OS in classifiers, suggesting targeted malicious behavior. Overall, this is a high-risk, malicious pattern consistent with malware delivery and execution during package installation."
