      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64 string that, when decoded, likely contains a PowerShell script that downloads or executes further malicious payloads from a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...). The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. This execution happens silently without user consent or interaction, and the subprocess is created with flags to hide the window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, this malicious behavior is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing code execution during package installation. The presence of a suspicious author email and domain in comments further supports the malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands that likely download and run malicious payloads, making it highly malicious."
