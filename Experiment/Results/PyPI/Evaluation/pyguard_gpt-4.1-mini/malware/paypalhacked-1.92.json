      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is likely used as a marker or to avoid repeated execution. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in a setup script context, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The package metadata uses suspicious names like 'paypalhacked' and an email address 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which are inconsistent with the described functionality and suggest malicious intent. The subprocess call uses creationflags to hide the window, further indicating stealthy execution. The overall pattern matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
