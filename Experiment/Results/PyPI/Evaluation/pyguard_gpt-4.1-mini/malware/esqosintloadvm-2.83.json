      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a hidden PowerShell process to download and execute an executable from a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and save it as a Windows cache executable, then invoke it. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and runs a remote payload without user consent or interaction. The check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and automatic execution during package installation. The domain and executable name are suspicious and unrelated to the declared package purpose. All these factors combined confirm that the code is malicious."
