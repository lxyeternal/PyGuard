      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and other sensitive user data. It collects Discord tokens from various browsers and Discord client storage locations, decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI, and gathers user environment information such as IP address and username. The stolen data is then exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1104290142912528457/TVOxheeA7nJpxR8ojtb8CsoHPjQx0OFpnr-fuecUZQ5ngkNiw5OFsBK2EItGRWra1DSV) without user consent. The code also searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files and folders with keywords related to accounts, passwords, secrets, and uploads them to anonymous file hosting services, then sends links to the attacker. It uses Windows API calls to decrypt encrypted browser data, copies browser databases to temporary files for extraction, kills browser processes to access locked files, and uses threading to perform these actions stealthily. The code is designed to run automatically without user interaction and includes obfuscation techniques such as suppressing exceptions, random temporary filenames, and indirect network calls. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook for data exfiltration, the harvesting of sensitive credentials and tokens, and the stealthy collection and upload of user files clearly indicate malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware."
