      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only then runs the hidden PowerShell command, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution or detection. This execution happens during the import or setup phase without user interaction or consent, which is a typical supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. The combination of hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands, lack of error handling, and execution triggered during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
