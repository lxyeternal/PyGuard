      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. This execution happens during the package setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during installation without user consent. The presence of a suspicious author email and domain (EsqueleSquad, tahgoficial@proton.me, and www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports malicious intent. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute an obfuscated PowerShell payload during package installation, which is a hallmark of malware."
