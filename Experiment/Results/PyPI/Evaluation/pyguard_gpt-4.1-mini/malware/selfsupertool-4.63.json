      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the legitimate purpose of the package. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious code within a seemingly benign package installation script. The use of subprocess to run hidden PowerShell commands with encoded payloads during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution without user consent or awareness. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and abuse of the package installation process."
