      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. The use of encrypted payload hidden inside the setup install hook is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution during package installation. The package name 'Matplotblib' is a typo-squatting variant of the legitimate 'matplotlib' package, which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The description and long description fields contain random-looking strings, indicating obfuscation and no legitimate purpose. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook. The code executes arbitrary decrypted code only on Windows systems, suggesting targeted malicious behavior. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated payload, execution of decrypted code during install, use of dynamic imports, and no user interaction or notification, all consistent with a supply chain malware attack."
