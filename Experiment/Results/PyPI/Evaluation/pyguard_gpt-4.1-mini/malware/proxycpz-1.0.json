      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior. It dynamically writes a Python script to a temporary file that contains code to fetch and execute remote code from a hardcoded, suspicious URL ('https://paste.website/p/400c3e4b-a59b-4598-a199-75e848aeaae3.txt') without any user interaction or validation. This remote code is executed immediately by spawning a new Python process to run the temporary file, using os.system with a command that launches the Python interpreter in windowed mode (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe'), which is a known evasion technique to suppress console windows. The entire operation is embedded in the setup script, meaning it triggers during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. The code suppresses exceptions silently, further hiding its activity. The use of exec() on network-fetched data, writing and executing temporary files, and the lack of any legitimate application logic around this network activity are strong indicators of malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to download and execute arbitrary code from an untrusted external source during package installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically writes a Python script to a temporary file that contains an exec() call on code fetched directly from a hardcoded external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/vrdpn/raw). This downloaded code is executed without any validation, user interaction, or consent, which is a critical red flag. The script then attempts to execute this temporary file using a system shell command, spawning a new Python interpreter process to run the downloaded code. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code on the fly, writing it to disk, and running it without validation—is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, enabling arbitrary code execution and potential system compromise. The use of obfuscated imports and variable names, silent exception handling, and execution of remote payloads without transparency or user notification further confirms the malicious intent."
