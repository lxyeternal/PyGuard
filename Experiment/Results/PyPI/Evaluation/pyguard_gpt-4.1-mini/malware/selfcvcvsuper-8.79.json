      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64 string that, when decoded, likely contains a PowerShell script that downloads or executes further malicious payloads from a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...). The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory ('tahg') before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. This execution happens silently without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The author and email fields in the setup call appear to be fake or unrelated to any legitimate project. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands that likely download and run malicious code, making it highly malicious."
