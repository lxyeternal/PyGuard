      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution window. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before running this command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The use of distutils setup with a seemingly innocuous package name ('py-virtualpaypal') and description is likely a disguise to appear legitimate while executing malicious payloads during installation. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further malicious code from a suspicious URL (the decoded command references 'dl.dropbox.com' and a suspicious executable 'WindowsCache.exe'). This pattern of hidden, encoded PowerShell execution triggered during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery. The absence of error handling and silent exception suppression further supports malicious intent."
