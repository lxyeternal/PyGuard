      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64 string that, when decoded, likely contains a PowerShell script that contacts a suspicious external URL (cdn.discordapp.com) to download or execute further code. This execution happens conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating staging or persistence behavior. The subprocess.Popen call uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The presence of this code inside a setup script (distutils.core.setup) suggests it triggers during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The author and email fields appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate software. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection. These factors combined—hidden execution of encoded PowerShell commands, use of suspicious external URLs, execution during package installation, and stealth techniques—are hallmark signs of malware."
