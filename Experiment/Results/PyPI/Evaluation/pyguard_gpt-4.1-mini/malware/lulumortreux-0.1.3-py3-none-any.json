      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and other sensitive user data. It collects environment information such as IP address, username, and geolocation, then extracts Discord tokens from various local application paths (Discord clients, browsers), decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption, and gathers additional user data like billing info and friends list via Discord API calls. The stolen data is exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without user consent. The code also searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files and folders with keywords related to accounts, passwords, wallets, and uploads them to anonymous file hosting services, then reports these to the attacker. It uses threading to perform these actions concurrently and kills processes to access locked files. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL, automated extraction and decryption of sensitive credentials, exfiltration of data to an external server, and absence of any legitimate user interaction or notification are strong indicators of malicious intent. This code matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including credential theft, data exfiltration, use of DPAPI decryption for passwords and cookies, and stealthy background operation."
