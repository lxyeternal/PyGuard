      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction, validation, or consent. It writes the downloaded content directly to a temporary file and immediately executes it using subprocess.call. This pattern matches a classic remote payload retrieval and execution sequence, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The absence of any legitimate application logic, user notification, or integrity checks, combined with the direct execution of a potentially untrusted binary, aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential system compromise."
