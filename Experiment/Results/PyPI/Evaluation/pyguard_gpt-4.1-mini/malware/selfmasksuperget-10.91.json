      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands used to evade detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or analysis. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious payloads during package installation without user consent. The subprocess call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and use of encoded PowerShell commands, all of which are hallmark behaviors of malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
