      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command subclassing setuptools' install command, which executes during package installation without user interaction or consent. Inside the run() method, it imports network-related libraries and collects the local machine's hostname and IP address. It then sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external, non-standard endpoint unrelated to the package's stated purpose. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for sending system information without user knowledge or consent, embedded in the install script, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network communication or data collection in the installation process. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware embedded in a Python package installation."
