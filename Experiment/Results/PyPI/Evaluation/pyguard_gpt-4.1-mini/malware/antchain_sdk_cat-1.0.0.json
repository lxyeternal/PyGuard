      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, it collects environment information such as the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This behavior occurs automatically during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard URL for exfiltration of system information during installation is a classic indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attack vectors. The code does not perform any legitimate application logic related to the package functionality and instead focuses on environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, as it enables attackers to gather sensitive system information stealthily and potentially track or target infected systems. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
