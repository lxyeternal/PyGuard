      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or sandbox environments. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during the setup script execution (which runs on package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the setup.py code appears benign, but the presence of this hidden, encoded, and stealthy PowerShell execution makes the entire script malicious."
