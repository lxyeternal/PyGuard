      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to execute code during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. During installation, it collects extensive system information including hostname, current working directory, username, and network IP addresses (both private and public). It enumerates files from root and common drive directories (c:\\, d:\\, /, /home), which can include sensitive user data. It then encodes and constructs a suspicious domain name dynamically using hex-encoded hostname, username, package name, current directory path components, and IP address, and performs a DNS lookup on this domain, likely for covert communication or tracking. Finally, it sends a POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (https://425a2.rt11.ml) with a JSON payload containing the collected system information and file listings. This unsolicited data exfiltration without user consent, combined with execution triggered automatically on package installation, use of obfuscated domain construction, and targeting of sensitive system information, matches multiple critical risk patterns associated with malware, including information stealing and supply chain attack techniques."
