      "malicious_behavior": "The code fetches a URL from a hardcoded, suspicious external source (https://rentry.co/2sv84/raw) without any user interaction or consent. It then downloads an executable binary from the resolved URL and writes it to a temporary directory under the current user's AppData Local Temp folder with a fixed filename 'Bin.exe'. Immediately after downloading, it executes this binary using subprocess.call without any validation or user notification. The execution is done in a new thread, which is a common evasion technique to avoid detection. This pattern of fetching a remote payload, writing it to a user directory, and executing it silently is a classic malware delivery and execution technique. The use of a non-standard URL shortener or pastebin-like service (rentry.co) to host the payload address further increases suspicion. There is no legitimate application logic, error handling, or user consent, and the code is designed to run automatically. These factors strongly indicate malicious intent."
