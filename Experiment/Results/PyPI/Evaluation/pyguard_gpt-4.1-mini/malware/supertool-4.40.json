      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. This execution happens immediately upon running the script, without user interaction or consent, and is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to hide malicious activity. These factors combined—hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands, conditional execution based on file existence, suppression of exceptions, and embedding in a package setup script—are strong indicators of malicious intent."
