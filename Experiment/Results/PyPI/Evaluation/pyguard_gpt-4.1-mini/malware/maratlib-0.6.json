      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated variable and function names and a decoding function (l111_cringe_) that reconstructs and evals a decoded string, which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique. The code imports setuptools and runs setup(), but outside of legitimate setup logic, it executes shell commands via subprocess.getoutput to download a shell script from a suspicious hardcoded URL (https://github.com/nedog123/files/raw/main/aza.sh) into /tmp/gay.sh, sets its permissions to 777, and immediately executes it with bash. This download-and-execute pattern without user consent or validation is a hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The commands are executed twice, increasing the likelihood of malicious payload execution. The use of subprocess to run shell commands during package setup without any user interaction or legitimate build steps strongly suggests a supply chain attack vector. The hardcoded URL is non-standard and unrelated to any known legitimate package source. There is no error handling or logging, and the code runs potentially harmful commands silently. These factors combined confirm that the code is malicious."
