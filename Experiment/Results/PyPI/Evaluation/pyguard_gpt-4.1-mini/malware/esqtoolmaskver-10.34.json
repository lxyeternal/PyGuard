      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a conditional execution pattern often used by malware to avoid repeated execution or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to legitimate Python packages. The malicious payload is embedded in the setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute code during package installation without user consent. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command and the creationflags subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates an attempt to run the payload silently. Overall, these factors strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated malicious payload during package installation, consistent with known malware patterns."
