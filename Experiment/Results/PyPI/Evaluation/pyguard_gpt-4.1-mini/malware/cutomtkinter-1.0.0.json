      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute arbitrary code during installation without user consent. The run() method conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. This behavior is triggered only on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), suggesting targeted malicious activity. The use of encrypted payload and exec() in setup/install scripts is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling attackers to run hidden malicious code during package installation. The package name 'cutomtkinter' appears to be a typo-squatting attempt to mimic a legitimate package. The presence of obfuscated class names and meaningless description strings further supports malicious intent. Overall, this code is a high-risk supply chain attack that executes hidden, encrypted malicious code at install time, which can lead to system compromise."
