      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded command is base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed without user consent or interaction. The code first checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' and only then runs the hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or ensure environment suitability. This execution happens during the package setup process, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution on installation. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command string is unusual and likely to evade simple detection. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is used as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealthy hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and use of suspicious external domains."
