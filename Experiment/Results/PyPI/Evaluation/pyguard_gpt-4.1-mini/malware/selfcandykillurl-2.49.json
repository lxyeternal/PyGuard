      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a hidden PowerShell process to download and execute a file from a suspicious external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and save it as '~\\WindowsCache.exe', then execute it. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and runs a remote payload without user consent or interaction. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of this code inside a setup script (using distutils.core.setup) suggests it is designed to execute during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and the commented URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) further hint at malicious intent. The subprocess call suppresses the window and uses an encoded command to evade detection and static analysis. Overall, this code is a clear example of a malicious payload delivery mechanism embedded in a Python package installation script."
