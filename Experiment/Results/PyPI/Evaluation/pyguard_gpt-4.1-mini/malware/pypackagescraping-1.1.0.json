      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It collects extensive sensitive data from the victim's system, including browser passwords, cookies, credit card information, Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, system information (hardware IDs, Windows keys, IP geolocation), and screenshots. It uses Windows DPAPI decryption (CryptUnprotectData) to decrypt stored credentials and browser data. The code exfiltrates this stolen data to attacker-controlled endpoints, specifically hardcoded suspicious URLs such as \"https://kekwltd.ru/relay\" and related webhook URLs. It also attempts to persist by copying itself to the Windows startup folder and can kill processes related to Discord and debugging tools to evade detection. The code includes clipboard hijacking functionality that replaces cryptocurrency wallet addresses in the clipboard with attacker-controlled addresses, a known theft technique. It performs network requests without user consent, uses obfuscated function and variable names, creates temporary files with randomized names, and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. The presence of hardcoded suspicious domains, extensive credential theft, data exfiltration, persistence mechanisms, and clipboard manipulation collectively confirm that this code is malicious and designed to steal sensitive user information and credentials for attacker benefit."
