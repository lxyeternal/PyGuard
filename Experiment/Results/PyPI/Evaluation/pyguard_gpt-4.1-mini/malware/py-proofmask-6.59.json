      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated PowerShell payloads stealthily. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. This execution occurs during the setup script, meaning it runs automatically during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a hallmark of malware aiming for stealthy code execution, potentially for downloading or executing further malicious payloads. No legitimate application logic justifies this behavior, and the code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Therefore, this code is malicious."
