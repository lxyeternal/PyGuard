      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then launches this hidden PowerShell process without user consent or interaction. This behavior is embedded in the setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command, combined with the hidden window style, strongly indicates an attempt to execute malicious payloads stealthily. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution in the installation script is a critical indicator of malicious intent."
