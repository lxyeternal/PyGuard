      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically during the setup process, which is a critical red flag. The decoded payload imports modules for temporary file handling, system execution, and URL requests, then downloads an executable file from a hardcoded suspicious URL (https://z3us.online/grab/miYOxGLuqZNlRESL), writes it to a temporary file, and executes it without any user interaction or validation. This behavior is consistent with a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is embedded in the package installation script to download and run arbitrary code from an external source. The use of exec on decoded base64 data, execution of downloaded content, absence of error handling, and lack of user consent all strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote code execution, obfuscation, and unauthorized payload delivery."
