      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during package installation (setup.py) aligns with known malware behaviors such as arbitrary code execution, stealthy payload delivery, and potential further malicious actions on the victim system. Additionally, the package setup metadata is suspicious (random strings for description and author), and the package is named 'etheerium' (a typo of 'ethereum'), which may be an attempt at typosquatting. All these factors combined confirm that the code is malicious."
