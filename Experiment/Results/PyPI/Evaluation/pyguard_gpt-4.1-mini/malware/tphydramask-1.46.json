      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting staging or evasion logic. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to legitimate package sources. This execution occurs during the setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command in this manner is a hallmark of malware attempting to run hidden payloads. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute an obfuscated PowerShell payload during package installation, which is a critical indicator of malicious intent."
