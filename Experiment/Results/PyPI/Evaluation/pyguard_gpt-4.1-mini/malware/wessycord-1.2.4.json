      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (AfterInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://cdn-141.anonfiles.com/scUeHf23z5/cfc2b34c-1689619361/payload.exe) without any user interaction or consent. After downloading, it immediately executes the downloaded file using os.system. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, where malicious payloads are fetched and executed during package installation, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system. The use of a non-standard, suspicious URL hosting an executable, combined with execution without validation or user notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as: execution of shell commands during install, downloading and running untrusted executables, hardcoded suspicious URLs, and lack of error handling or user consent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
