      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution window. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest suspicious origins. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation without user consent. The combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent, likely for unauthorized code execution, persistence, or payload delivery."
