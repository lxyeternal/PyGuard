      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python snippet to a temporary file that performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious URL ('https://rentry.co/277t2/raw') and executes the downloaded content directly via exec(). This is a classic remote code execution pattern with no user interaction or validation, which is a critical red flag. The code then attempts to execute this temporary file using a system shell command, launching a new Python interpreter process with the temporary file as an argument. The use of a non-standard URL, dynamic code fetching and execution, writing to a temp file, and immediate shell execution without any user consent or validation strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary remote code execution, payload staging, and stealthy execution. Therefore, the code is malicious."
