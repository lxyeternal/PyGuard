      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing obfuscated and encrypted code during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of encrypted payloads in setup/install scripts to execute arbitrary code is a known supply chain attack vector. The code also depends on external modules (requests, fernet) specifically for this purpose. The obfuscation of class names and meaningless description strings further supports the intent to hide malicious behavior. Overall, this code enables arbitrary code execution at install time on Windows systems, which is a critical security risk and consistent with malware patterns."
