      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects environment information by executing the 'env' shell command and reading its output, which can include sensitive environment variables. It also enumerates files in the parent directory './../'. Then, it encodes this collected data (environment variables and file list) and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL 'http://pt.traktrain.com/req.php'. This behavior is consistent with unauthorized data exfiltration. Furthermore, this network communication occurs without any user interaction or consent and is embedded directly in the setup script, which means it will execute during package installation. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded external domain for data transmission, combined with environment discovery and file enumeration, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector."
