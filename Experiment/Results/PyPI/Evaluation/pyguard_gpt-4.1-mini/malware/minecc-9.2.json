      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists and only then runs this hidden command, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution or detection in analysis environments. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in a setup script context, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. The use of subprocess to run hidden PowerShell with encoded commands, combined with the lack of error handling and silent exception suppression, strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at executing hidden payloads on Windows systems."
