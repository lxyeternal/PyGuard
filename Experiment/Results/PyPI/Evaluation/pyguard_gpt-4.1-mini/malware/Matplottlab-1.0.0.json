      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. This decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, encrypted payload, and execution during package installation strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector. The package name 'Matplottlab' is a typo-squatting variant of a popular package (matplotlib), which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only for the malicious payload execution. The encrypted payload and the use of exec() to run decrypted code during installation is a classic hallmark of malware aiming for remote code execution and persistence. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution during install, obfuscation, encrypted payload execution, and no user interaction or consent before execution."
