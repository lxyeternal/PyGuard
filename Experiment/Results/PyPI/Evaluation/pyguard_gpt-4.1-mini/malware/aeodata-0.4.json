      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It includes base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and executed dynamically via exec(), which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique. The code triggers execution during package installation (setup.py), which is a known supply chain attack vector. It conditionally executes different payloads depending on the OS, with Windows payloads using base64-decoded PowerShell commands run in hidden mode, a hallmark of stealthy malware. The Linux/macOS payload performs HTTP requests to suspicious endpoints, collects environment and system information, and attempts to download and execute additional code. The code writes files to system or user directories without validation or user consent, uses obfuscated or compressed payloads, and spawns threads and shell commands to evade detection. It also includes network communication to hardcoded, non-standard URLs and IPs, likely for command-and-control or data exfiltration. These behaviors align with known malware patterns such as remote code execution, persistence, environment reconnaissance, and payload delivery. Therefore, this code is malicious."
