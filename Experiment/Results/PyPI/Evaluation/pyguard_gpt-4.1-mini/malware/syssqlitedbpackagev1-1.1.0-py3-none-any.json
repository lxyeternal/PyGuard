      "malicious_behavior": "The code installs a non-standard package named 'fernet' via pip using os.system, which is suspicious as the legitimate cryptography package is named 'cryptography' and 'Fernet' is a class within it. Then it imports Fernet from this installed package and uses a hardcoded cryptographic key and a large encrypted payload. The payload is decrypted and executed dynamically using exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution from an obfuscated source. This pattern is a hallmark of malware, as it hides the true intent and payload from static analysis and executes potentially harmful code without user consent or interaction. The use of exec() on decrypted data, combined with dynamic installation of a suspicious package, strongly indicates malicious behavior."
