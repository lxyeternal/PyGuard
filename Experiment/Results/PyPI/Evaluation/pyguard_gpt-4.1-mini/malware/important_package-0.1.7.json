      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the host details (os.uname), user home directory, environment variables, and current working directory, then serializes and base64-encodes this data. It then sends this encoded data via an HTTP request to a suspicious external endpoint ('https://pypi.org/reqs?d=') with a forged 'Host' header ('psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net'). The use of environment variable access combined with encoding and immediate network transmission to a non-standard, suspicious domain is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this behavior. The code suppresses exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. The endpoint and header manipulation suggest an attempt to disguise or redirect the exfiltration. These factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, specifically data exfiltration and system fingerprinting for potential command-and-control communication."
