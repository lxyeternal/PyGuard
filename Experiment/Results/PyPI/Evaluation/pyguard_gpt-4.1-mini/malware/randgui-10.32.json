      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens silently without user consent or notification, and the subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to avoid any visible window. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution in the setup script strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during package installation. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, encoded PowerShell commands, execution during package setup, and lack of error handling, all of which are hallmark signs of malware."
