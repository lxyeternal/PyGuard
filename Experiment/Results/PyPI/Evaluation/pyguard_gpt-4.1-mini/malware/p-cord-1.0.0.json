      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior due to the following reasons: It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known vector for executing arbitrary code during package installation (a supply chain attack vector). Inside the overridden run() method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code via exec(). The decryption uses a hardcoded Fernet key and an encrypted payload, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation and hiding of malicious intent. The exec() call on decrypted data allows arbitrary code execution without user consent during installation. The code only executes this payload on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), which is typical for targeted attacks. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution in the install hook is a classic hallmark of malware aiming to evade detection and execute malicious payloads silently during package installation. The rest of the setup.py metadata is obfuscated or meaningless, further indicating an attempt to disguise malicious intent. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and should be classified as malicious."
