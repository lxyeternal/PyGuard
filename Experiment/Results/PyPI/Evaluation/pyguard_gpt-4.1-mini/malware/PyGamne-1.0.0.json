      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which executes arbitrary code during package installation without user consent. Specifically, in the run() method, it checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses Fernet symmetric encryption with a hardcoded key to decrypt an encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. The payload is obfuscated and hidden inside the install process, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows attackers to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine stealthily. The package metadata is filled with meaningless strings, likely to avoid suspicion. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only for the malicious payload execution. The behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns such as code execution at install time, obfuscated payload execution, use of cryptography to hide payload, and execution of network-related modules without user interaction. Therefore, this code is malicious."
