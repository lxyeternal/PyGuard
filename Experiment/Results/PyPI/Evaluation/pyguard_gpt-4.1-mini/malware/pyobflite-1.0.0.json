      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It automatically installs numerous external packages without user consent, which is suspicious. The function send_discord_info() downloads a Python script from a hardcoded, non-standard, suspicious URL (a raw GitHubusercontent URL pointing to 'WindowsDefender.py' in a user repository) directly into the user's home directory without validation or notification. It then immediately executes this downloaded script using subprocess.run(['python', ruta]), and subsequently deletes the script file. This pattern of downloading and executing remote code without user interaction or integrity checks is a classic malware behavior, enabling remote code execution and potential payload delivery. The code is embedded in a setup script context, which can be used as a supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during package installation. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying these actions. The use of a suspicious hardcoded URL, writing executable files to the user's home directory, immediate execution of downloaded code, and self-deletion of the payload file are all critical risk indicators of malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
