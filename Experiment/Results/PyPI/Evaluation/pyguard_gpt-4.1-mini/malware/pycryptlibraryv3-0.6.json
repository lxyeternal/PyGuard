      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It performs extensive credential and token theft from various browsers and applications, including Chrome, Firefox, Discord, Roblox, Minecraft, and others. The code decrypts stored passwords, cookies, credit card data, and Discord tokens using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption, then collects system information such as Windows keys, hardware IDs, IP geolocation, and running processes. It exfiltrates this sensitive data to attacker-controlled endpoints, specifically hardcoded URLs like 'https://prepaidroot.ru/relay' and Discord webhooks hosted on suspicious domains. The code also attempts persistence by copying itself to the Windows startup folder and can kill Discord-related processes to evade detection. Additionally, it hijacks the clipboard to replace cryptocurrency wallet addresses with attacker-controlled addresses, a known theft technique. The code suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, uses obfuscated function and variable names, dynamically installs dependencies, and runs background threads for continuous data theft. All these behaviors—credential harvesting, token stealing, system fingerprinting, data exfiltration to suspicious external servers, persistence mechanisms, and clipboard hijacking—are hallmark traits of malware designed for covert information theft and unauthorized access. Therefore, this code is definitively malicious."
