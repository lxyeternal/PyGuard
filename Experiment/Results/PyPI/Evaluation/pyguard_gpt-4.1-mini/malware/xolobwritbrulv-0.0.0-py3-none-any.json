      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and multiple layers of string replacements before execution. It uses exec() on decoded base64 data, which is a classic hallmark of malicious code attempting to hide its true intent. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly indicate an attempt to evade static analysis. Such patterns are consistently associated with malware, as they enable arbitrary code execution from obfuscated sources. The code lacks any legitimate application logic or user interaction and is designed to execute hidden payloads. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and evasion techniques."
