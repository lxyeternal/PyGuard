      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools' install command to override the run method, which executes arbitrary code during package installation without user consent. The run method checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. The payload is obfuscated and encrypted, hiding its true intent, which is a common malware technique to evade detection. The package metadata uses nonsensical, obfuscated strings for description and author fields, further indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this malicious payload execution. This pattern—executing decrypted code at install time, with no user interaction or notification—is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
