      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting staging or evasion logic. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the stated package purpose. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover, as it defines a seemingly benign package, but the actual malicious payload is executed before it. The use of subprocess to run hidden PowerShell commands with encoded payloads during package setup or installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution without user consent or awareness. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands on Windows systems during package installation or execution, which is a hallmark of malware."
