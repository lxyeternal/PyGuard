      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute hidden malicious code during installation. The run() method checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution from obfuscated data. The payload is hidden inside the install script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The package name 'tensofla' is a typo-squatting variant of 'tensorflow', a common tactic to trick users. The description and long description are nonsensical and obfuscated, further indicating malicious intent. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only for the malicious payload execution. The code executes without user interaction or consent during installation, which is a typical characteristic of malware. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution at install time, use of encrypted payloads, obfuscated class and variable names, and execution of network-related modules to potentially fetch or exfiltrate data. Therefore, this code is malicious."
