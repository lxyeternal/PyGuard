      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that, immediately after the standard installation or development setup, collect all environment variables from the user's system and send them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://eewtrzyimp165no1u4kqfhv0nrtih95y.oastify.com) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes unauthorized exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data during package installation or development setup, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of a non-standard, obscure domain for data exfiltration, combined with the automatic triggering of network communication during install/develop commands, strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission, no user notification, and no error handling to mitigate detection. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is a critical risk and a hallmark of malware that performs environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration as part of a supply chain attack."
