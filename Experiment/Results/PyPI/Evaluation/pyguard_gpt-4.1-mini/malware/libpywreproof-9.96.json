      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The command is executed without any user interaction or consent and is triggered conditionally if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating staging or persistence behavior. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious payloads during package installation. All these factors align with multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including stealth execution, obfuscation, lack of user consent, and execution during package setup."
