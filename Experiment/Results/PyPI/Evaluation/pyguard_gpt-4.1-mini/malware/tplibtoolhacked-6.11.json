      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, indicating an attempt to hide execution from the user. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious author name 'EsqueleSquad' and email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' along with a package name 'tplibtoolhacked' further suggests malicious intent. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious code during package installation without user consent. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution, suppression of exceptions, suspicious directory checks, and embedding in a setup script strongly indicates malicious behavior."
