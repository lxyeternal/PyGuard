      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a clear example of malicious behavior, specifically a Discord token stealer and data exfiltration malware. It searches for Discord and various browser token files in user directories, extracts authentication tokens using regex patterns, and sends these tokens along with system information (IP address, PC username, platform) to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code also kills the 'Fiddler.exe' process in a separate thread, likely to prevent network traffic inspection or debugging. There is no user interaction or consent, and sensitive data is collected and sent externally without authorization. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including environment discovery, credential theft, data exfiltration, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and stealth techniques (threading to kill processes). Therefore, this code is malicious."
