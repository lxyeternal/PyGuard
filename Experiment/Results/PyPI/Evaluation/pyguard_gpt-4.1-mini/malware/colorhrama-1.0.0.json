      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class (GruppeInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing arbitrary, obfuscated code at install time without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution in the installation process strongly indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent and evade static analysis. Additionally, the package metadata fields (name, author, description) appear obfuscated or nonsensical, which is common in malicious packages to avoid detection. The presence of network-related modules (requests) imported only in this context suggests potential network activity in the decrypted payload, further increasing the risk. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including arbitrary code execution during package installation, obfuscation, and use of cryptography to hide payloads."
