      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens immediately upon import or setup, without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script. The setup call itself is benign-looking but is likely a decoy or cover for the malicious payload execution. The use of hidden PowerShell with encoded commands, subprocess execution without error handling, and obfuscation are all strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware delivery mechanisms."
