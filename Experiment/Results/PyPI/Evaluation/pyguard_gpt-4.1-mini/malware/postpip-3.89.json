      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens during the setup script, which means it triggers on package installation without user consent, a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy to disguise the malicious intent. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, combined with the lack of error handling and obfuscation, strongly indicates malicious intent such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise."
