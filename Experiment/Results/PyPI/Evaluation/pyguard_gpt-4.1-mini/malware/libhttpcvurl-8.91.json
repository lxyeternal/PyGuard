      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' hint at a suspicious or attacker-controlled entity. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution occurs outside of any user interaction or consent, embedded directly in the setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated hidden execution of PowerShell commands during package setup, no user consent, and stealth techniques, all hallmark signs of malware."
