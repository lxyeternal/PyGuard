      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior embedded in the installation process of a Python package. Specifically, the CustomInstallCommand class overrides the install command to execute a large base64-decoded payload during package installation without user consent. This payload performs multiple malicious actions: it collects detailed system information (e.g., username, OS details, network info), writes and executes multiple PowerShell scripts and binaries from hardcoded suspicious paths under the user's AppData roaming directory, and downloads and runs additional executables from external URLs (e.g., https://api-hw.com/dl/w). The use of base64 encoding and exec to hide the payload, execution of shell commands in hidden windows, writing to user directories without validation, and network communication to non-standard domains are all classic indicators of malware. This pattern is a textbook example of a supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code execution is triggered during package installation, enabling remote code execution, persistence, and potential data exfiltration. The absence of any legitimate application logic or user interaction further confirms the malicious intent."
