      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and dynamic execution via exec(). The decoded payload itself is a large block of obfuscated data, which is a common technique used by malware to evade static analysis. The use of exec() on base64-decoded data is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. Such patterns are strongly associated with malicious behavior, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential data exfiltration. The code lacks any legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the obfuscation level suggests intent to hide malicious actions. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
