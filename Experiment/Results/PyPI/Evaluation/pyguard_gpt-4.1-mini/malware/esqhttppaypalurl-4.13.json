      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It conditionally checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' and if it does not exist, it executes a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily without user awareness. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to a suspicious domain 'cdn.discordapp.com' with a path that appears to be a direct executable download ('Esquele.exe'), and then executes it with hidden window flags. This pattern is a classic malware behavior involving remote payload retrieval and execution, stealth execution to evade detection, and use of obfuscation (base64 encoded PowerShell command). Additionally, this execution is embedded in the setup script, which means it triggers during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The presence of a suspicious author email and package name further supports the malicious intent. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is overshadowed by the covert execution of the encoded PowerShell command. Overall, this code is designed to download and execute a potentially malicious payload silently during installation, which is a critical risk and hallmark of malware."
