      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute arbitrary code during installation without user consent. The run() method conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag for arbitrary code execution. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description strings further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code only executes this payload on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), which is typical for targeted malware. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution during install time is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution on the victim's machine. The presence of 'requests' suggests possible network communication, likely for downloading or exfiltrating data, although the exact decrypted payload is not visible here. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated install-time code execution, encrypted payload execution, and use of external libraries for network activity."
