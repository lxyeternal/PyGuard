      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated detection or to check for analysis environments. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious code during package installation without user consent. The subprocess call suppresses the window, runs an encoded command, and does not handle exceptions visibly, further indicating stealthy malicious intent. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, suspicious directory checks, and execution during package setup, all consistent with malware behavior."
