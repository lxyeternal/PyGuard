      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including OS name and version, current working directory, hostname, and logged-in username, then immediately sends this sensitive environment data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious, non-standard external URL (http://zkecscnceogkcofvfnoqf068bapiwbnp2.22.ax). This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical risk indicators of malicious activity, specifically system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to an untrusted external server without user consent or notification. The domain is non-standard and appears random or obfuscated, which is typical for malware command-and-control or data collection endpoints. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this network call. The immediate transmission of sensitive system and user information to a suspicious external endpoint is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
