      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window, increasing stealth. The presence of this code in a setup script (commonly run during package installation) indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes automatically during installation without user consent. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and the commented URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' are suspicious and unrelated to the declared package purpose. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated payload execution, stealthy hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and conditional execution based on environment state, all consistent with malware behavior."
