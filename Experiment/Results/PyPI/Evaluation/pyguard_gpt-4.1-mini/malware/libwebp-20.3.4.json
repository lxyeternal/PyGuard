      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, it collects system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL hosted on an ngrok.io domain. This behavior occurs automatically during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard external URL for exfiltration of system information during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern aligns with known supply chain attack vectors where malicious code is embedded in setup or install scripts to perform unauthorized data exfiltration. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, making it a high-risk malicious behavior."
