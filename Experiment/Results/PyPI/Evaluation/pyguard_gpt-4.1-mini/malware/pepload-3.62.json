      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist before launching this hidden PowerShell process, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a setup script for a Python package. Such behavior is a classic hallmark of malicious code, often used in supply chain attacks or malware delivery via Python packages. The rest of the code is a standard-looking setup() call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy, obfuscated payload execution during package installation."
