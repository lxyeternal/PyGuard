      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation, without user consent or interaction, embedded in a setup script context. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command is a classic malware pattern for covert code execution. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. These factors combined—hidden PowerShell execution, encoded command, conditional directory check, and embedding in setup—are strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks or malware delivery."
