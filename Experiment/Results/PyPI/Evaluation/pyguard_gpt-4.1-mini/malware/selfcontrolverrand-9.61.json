      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed without user consent or interaction, and the subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to avoid any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a non-standard, potentially malicious source. The malicious payload is embedded in the setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command string is suspicious and likely to spawn a hidden process executing potentially harmful commands. The overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and use of encoded PowerShell commands, all of which are hallmark signs of malware."
