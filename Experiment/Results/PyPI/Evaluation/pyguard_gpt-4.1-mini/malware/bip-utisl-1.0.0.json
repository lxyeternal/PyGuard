      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known supply chain attack vector. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent or interaction. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, as it allows attackers to deliver and execute hidden malicious payloads during package installation, bypassing static detection. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution hides the true intent and content of the code, making it evasive. The package metadata (name, author, description) appears obfuscated and meaningless, further indicating malicious intent. The setup script triggers this behavior automatically on installation, which is a classic supply chain attack technique. Therefore, this code is malicious."
