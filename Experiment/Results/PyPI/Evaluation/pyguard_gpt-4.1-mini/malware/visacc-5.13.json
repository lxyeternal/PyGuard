      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation process. These characteristics align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including stealth execution, obfuscation, execution during package installation, and lack of user consent or notification."
