      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python snippet to a temporary file that imports urllib.request.urlopen to fetch and execute code directly from a hardcoded external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/yoodz/raw) without any user interaction or validation. It then immediately executes this temporary file using a system shell command that runs the Python interpreter in windowed mode. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code at install time without user consent—is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The use of setup.py to trigger this behavior during package installation further confirms malicious intent, as it abuses the trusted installation process to run arbitrary code. The external URL is suspicious and unrelated to the package's declared purpose. There is no error handling, logging, or user notification, and the code uses obfuscated variable names and indirect imports to hide its intent. All these factors combined make this code malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically writes a Python script to a temporary file that contains an exec() call on code fetched directly from a hardcoded external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/yoodz/raw) without any validation or user consent. It then executes this temporary script using the Python interpreter in a new process via os.system. This pattern of fetching and executing remote code at runtime is a critical indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source, bypassing static analysis and user control. The use of a temporary file to stage the payload and immediate execution without transparency or safeguards strongly suggests a remote code execution attack vector, typical of malware or backdoors."
