      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a conditional execution pattern often used by malware to avoid repeated execution or detection. The PowerShell command appears to invoke 'Invoke-WebRequest' to download or interact with a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com), which is a common malware hosting domain. This behavior is embedded in the setup script, meaning it triggers during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command with encoded payload and hidden window style is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is overshadowed by this stealthy, obfuscated remote code execution attempt. Therefore, this code is malicious."
