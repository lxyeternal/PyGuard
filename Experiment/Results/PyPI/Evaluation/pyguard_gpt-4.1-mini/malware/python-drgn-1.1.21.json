      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py install hook). It collects detailed system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then immediately sends all this sensitive system and user information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL, which is an external endpoint unrelated to any legitimate package functionality. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration without user consent or notification. The code runs these commands and network communication silently during installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration, combined with gathering sensitive environment and network information, and triggering this on install time, are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."
