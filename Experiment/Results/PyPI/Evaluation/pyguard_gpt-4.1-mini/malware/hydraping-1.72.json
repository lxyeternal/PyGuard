      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated PowerShell payloads stealthily. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, likely as a persistence or evasion mechanism. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in a setup script context, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup is a critical indicator of malicious intent, consistent with malware delivery and execution patterns."
