      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) or backdoor malware. It establishes a persistent outbound TCP connection to a hardcoded suspicious domain (securedmaininfo5.zapto.org) on port 3000 without any user interaction or consent. It collects detailed system information including hostname, OS version, username, and environment variables, and sends this data to the remote server, which is typical for system fingerprinting in malware. The code prevents multiple instances by using a mutex, a common anti-analysis technique. It includes sandbox and virtual machine detection to evade analysis environments. It implements a keylogger using pynput to capture keystrokes silently and can start, stop, and dump keylogs remotely. It can take screenshots and send them to the server. It can browse files, upload and download arbitrary files, and execute arbitrary shell commands received from the server, sending back the output, effectively providing full remote control. It can lock the workstation, shutdown or restart the system, and disable Task Manager by running a VBScript that terminates taskmgr.exe and optionally shows a popup, which is a known malware persistence and anti-analysis technique. It steals saved Chrome passwords by reading the Chrome SQLite database and decrypting passwords using Windows DPAPI (win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData), then exfiltrates them to the server. It copies itself to the APPDATA directory and adds a registry Run key for persistence on startup. It writes and executes temporary VBScript files to perform process blocking and message boxes. The code runs in an infinite loop, reconnecting to the server if the connection drops, maintaining persistent remote access. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent, and the code is designed to stealthily control and exfiltrate data from the victim machine. All these behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as unauthorized remote control, credential theft, persistence, evasion, and data exfiltration."
