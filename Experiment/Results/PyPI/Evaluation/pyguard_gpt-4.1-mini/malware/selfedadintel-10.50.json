      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the stated package purpose. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent or interaction. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and abuse of the package installation process for unauthorized code execution."
