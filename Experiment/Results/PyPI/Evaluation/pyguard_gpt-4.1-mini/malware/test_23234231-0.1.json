      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It contains heavily obfuscated and base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and executed dynamically via exec(), a hallmark of malware attempting to evade static analysis. The code is embedded within a setup script, triggering execution during package installation, which is a common supply chain attack vector. It conditionally executes different payloads depending on the operating system, including spawning hidden PowerShell processes with encoded commands on Windows, another classic malware technique for stealthy code execution. The payloads perform environment discovery, collect system and user information, and send data to suspicious external endpoints, indicating data exfiltration. The code writes and executes files in obscure or temporary directories without user consent, and uses obfuscated network communication patterns. These behaviors align with known malware patterns such as remote code execution, persistence, information stealing, and command-and-control communication. Therefore, this code is conclusively malicious."
