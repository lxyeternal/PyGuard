      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. This execution happens during the import or setup phase without any user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, which serves as a cover for the malicious payload. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package installation is a critical risk indicator of malware, consistent with known malicious patterns for remote code execution, stealth, and potential further payload delivery."
