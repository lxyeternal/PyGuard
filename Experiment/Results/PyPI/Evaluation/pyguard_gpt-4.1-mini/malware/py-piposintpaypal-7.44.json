      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or detection. The URL embedded in the encoded command points to a suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com) hosting an executable file named 'Esquele.exe', which is likely a malicious payload being downloaded and executed. This behavior is triggered during the package setup process, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during installation. The use of try-except blocks suppresses any errors, further indicating an attempt to hide malicious activity. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily download and execute a remote payload without user knowledge, which is a hallmark of malware."
