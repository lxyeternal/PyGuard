      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing this hidden command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure persistence. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup or installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the setup.py code appears benign but is used as a cover to hide the malicious payload execution. The absence of error handling and silent exception suppression further supports stealthy malicious intent."
