      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists and only then runs this hidden command, which is a common evasion technique. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. These characteristics—hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands, obfuscation, execution during package setup, and suppression of exceptions—are strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware delivery mechanisms."
