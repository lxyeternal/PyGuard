      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) that is unrelated to the stated package purpose and is likely used to download or execute a malicious payload. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or ensure environment suitability. This execution happens during the package setup process, which is a common supply chain attack vector to run malicious code upon installation without user consent. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') along with the commented URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) also hint at malicious intent or at least a suspicious source. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden execution of a remote payload during package installation, use of suspicious URLs, and stealth techniques confirms this code is malicious."
