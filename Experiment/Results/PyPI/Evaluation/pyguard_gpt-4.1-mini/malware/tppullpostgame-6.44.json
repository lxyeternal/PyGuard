      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) which is unrelated to the package's stated purpose and likely used to download or execute a malicious payload. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution occurs during the package setup process without user consent or notification, indicating a supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is overshadowed by the hidden execution of the encoded PowerShell command. These factors collectively indicate that the code is malicious."
