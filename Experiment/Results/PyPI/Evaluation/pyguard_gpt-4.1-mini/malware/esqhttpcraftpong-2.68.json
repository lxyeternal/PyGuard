      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and if it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated and runs without user interaction or consent, which is a classic technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The use of an encoded PowerShell command in a setup script (which is typically run during package installation) strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector or malware delivery mechanism. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package purpose. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded payload in the installation script is a critical indicator of malicious intent."
