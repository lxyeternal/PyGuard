      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a conditional execution pattern often used by malware to avoid repeated execution or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest suspicious or non-standard sources. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution occurs outside of any user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of this hidden, obfuscated, and stealthy PowerShell execution during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
