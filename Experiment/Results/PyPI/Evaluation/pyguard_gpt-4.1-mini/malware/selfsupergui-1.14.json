      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or sandbox environments. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during the setup script execution (which runs on package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. These factors combined—hidden execution, encoded payload, execution during package setup, and lack of transparency—are strong indicators of malicious intent."
