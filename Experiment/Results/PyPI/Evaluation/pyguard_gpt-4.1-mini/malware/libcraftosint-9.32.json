      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or analysis. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution occurs in the setup script, which means it runs during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup.py code appears to be a facade to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. Based on the extensive knowledge points, this pattern is a hallmark of malware that executes hidden, obfuscated commands during installation to perform unauthorized actions, potentially including downloading further payloads, persistence, or system compromise."
