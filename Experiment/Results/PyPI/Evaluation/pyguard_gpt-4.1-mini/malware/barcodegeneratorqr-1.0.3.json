      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class 'Updater' that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, it constructs a hardcoded URL to download a Python script named 'qrcodegen.py' from a suspicious external CDN domain (https://cdn.discordapp.com/app.co1121082847780929579/1121087876713680936/qrcodegen.py). It then writes the downloaded content directly to disk without any validation or user consent and immediately executes it using subprocess.check_call with the current Python interpreter. This behavior constitutes arbitrary remote code execution triggered automatically during package installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated string concatenation to build the URL, the lack of error handling or user notification, and the execution of untrusted code from an external source are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote payload retrieval, execution during install time, and absence of legitimate application logic justifying such actions."
