      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding, including hex-encoded strings, base64 decoding, and dynamic evaluation via eval and exec. It imports modules dynamically and reconstructs code at runtime, which is a common evasion technique used by malware. The code includes functions that decode and decompress data, then execute it dynamically, indicating arbitrary code execution from obfuscated payloads. The presence of base64 decoding combined with eval/exec on the decoded data is a critical red flag for malicious intent. Additionally, the code appears to perform environment discovery and likely exfiltrates or executes further payloads without user consent or interaction. The obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns align with known malware behaviors such as remote payload retrieval, code injection, and stealthy execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
