      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions silently. This execution happens conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or detection. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution embedded in the setup script strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. Such behavior is consistent with malware that seeks to execute arbitrary code during package installation or setup, often to download further payloads, establish persistence, or perform other unauthorized actions."
