      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute hidden malicious code during installation. The run() method checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. The payload is obfuscated and encrypted, hiding its true intent, and is executed without user consent or interaction during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of cryptography with a hardcoded key and ciphertext, dynamic imports, and execution of decrypted code at install time strongly indicates malicious intent. The package metadata and class names are obfuscated and meaningless, further suggesting an attempt to evade detection. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution during install, obfuscation, and use of encrypted payloads executed via exec(). Therefore, this code is malicious."
