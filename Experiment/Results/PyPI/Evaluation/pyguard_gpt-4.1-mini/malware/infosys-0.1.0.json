      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and other sensitive files. It collects Discord tokens from various browsers and Discord client storage, decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption, and gathers user environment information such as IP address, username, and geolocation. The stolen data is exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is a common technique for covert data theft. The code also searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files and folders with keywords related to accounts, passwords, and secrets, uploads these files to anonymous file hosting services, and sends links to the attacker. It uses threading to perform these actions concurrently and attempts to kill processes (e.g., browsers, Telegram) to access locked files. The presence of Windows-specific DPAPI decryption, hardcoded external webhook URL, automated extraction and exfiltration of sensitive credentials, and no user consent or interaction clearly indicate malicious intent. This code matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including credential theft, data exfiltration, use of obfuscated or encrypted payloads, and stealthy background execution."
