      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically using exec and compile functions. This payload imports modules for temporary file handling, system execution, and URL opening, then writes content fetched from suspicious hardcoded IP addresses (http://193.42.33.24/inject/1zGPvS8IX5cz9sSH and http://193.42.33.24/clip) into temporary files. It executes these files and runs system commands with the temporary files' names. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic code execution, fetching and executing code from hardcoded external IP addresses without user consent, and execution of downloaded content are classic hallmarks of malicious behavior. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as remote code execution, payload retrieval from suspicious URLs, obfuscation, and execution of arbitrary code, all without user interaction or validation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
