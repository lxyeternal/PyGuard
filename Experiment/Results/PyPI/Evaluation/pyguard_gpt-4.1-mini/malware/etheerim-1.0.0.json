      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This means arbitrary code execution occurs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload and exec() to run decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true behavior from static analysis. The code is embedded in the setup.py install hook, a known supply chain attack vector. The package metadata and class names are obfuscated and meaningless, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) in the install process suggests potential for downloading or executing further malicious payloads. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, and use of encrypted payloads executed without user consent."
