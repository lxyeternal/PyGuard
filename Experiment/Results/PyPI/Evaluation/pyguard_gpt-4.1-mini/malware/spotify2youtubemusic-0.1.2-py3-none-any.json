      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads content from a specified URL and writes it directly to the Windows Startup folder under the user's AppData Roaming path without any user interaction, validation, or notification. Writing files to the Startup folder is a well-known persistence mechanism used by malware to ensure execution on system startup. The absence of any validation or user consent, combined with the use of a network request to fetch potentially executable content and saving it in a location that triggers automatic execution, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches the critical risk indicator of remote payload retrieval and local persistence, a foundational step in many malware infection chains."
