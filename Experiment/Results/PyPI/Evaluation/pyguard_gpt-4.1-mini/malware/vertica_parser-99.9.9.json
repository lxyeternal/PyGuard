      "malicious_behavior": "The code embeds a data exfiltration mechanism triggered automatically during package installation, development setup, or egg info generation by subclassing setuptools commands. It collects sensitive environment information including the package name, hostname, current user, and current working directory, serializes this data to JSON, encodes it as a hex string, splits it into chunks, and covertly exfiltrates it via DNS requests to a suspicious, non-standard domain 'uchpuchmak.lol' using a custom DNS query function. This behavior occurs without user interaction or consent, during installation phases, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of DNS queries for data exfiltration is a known stealth technique to evade detection by traditional network monitoring. The domain used is not related to the package's stated purpose and is likely attacker-controlled. The code lacks any legitimate application logic justifying this network activity, and the exfiltration of system and user information to an external domain during install is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
