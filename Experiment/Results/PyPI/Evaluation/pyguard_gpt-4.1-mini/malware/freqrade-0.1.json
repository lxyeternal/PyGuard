      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated string construction and variable names to hide its intent. The code executes during package setup, which is a known supply chain attack vector. It imports modules dynamically and attempts to install packages via pip programmatically. It performs environment checks, including administrative privilege checks, and manipulates system directories and files in user home paths. The code creates and writes files with obfuscated names, uses Windows COM interfaces to create and save shortcuts, and walks through directories to find and manipulate files with suspicious extensions. It also uses obfuscated loops and conditions to control execution flow, likely to evade static analysis. These behaviors align with known malware patterns such as persistence setup, payload deployment, and potential remote code execution. The absence of legitimate application logic, combined with obfuscation, dynamic code execution, file system manipulation in sensitive locations, and execution triggered during package installation, confirms that this code is malicious."
