      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a conditional execution pattern often used to avoid repeated execution or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during the setup script execution is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The rest of the setup.py code appears benign, but the presence of this hidden, encoded, and stealthy command execution makes the entire code malicious."
