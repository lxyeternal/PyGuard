      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware and clipboard hijacking. It collects extensive sensitive data from the victim's system, including browser-stored passwords, cookies, credit card information, Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Minecraft files, and system information such as Windows keys, hardware IDs, IP geolocation, and more. The code decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows DPAPI and AES, indicating intent to extract protected credentials. It also attempts to replace cryptocurrency wallet addresses in the clipboard with attacker-controlled addresses, a known clipboard hijacking technique to steal cryptocurrency. The malware establishes persistence by copying itself to the Windows startup folder and can kill Discord-related processes to evade detection or interfere with security tools. It exfiltrates all collected data and files by uploading them to attacker-controlled endpoints, including hardcoded suspicious URLs (e.g., https://kekwltd.ru/relay) and Discord webhooks. The code uses obfuscated function and variable names, suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, and runs multiple background threads for continuous data theft and monitoring. It also performs environment checks to avoid running in virtual machines or analysis environments. The initial lines install required packages silently and send a notification with the PC username to a suspicious external server without user consent. All these behaviors—credential theft, data exfiltration, clipboard hijacking, persistence, process killing, and environment evasion—are hallmark traits of malicious malware designed for stealthy information theft and unauthorized access."
