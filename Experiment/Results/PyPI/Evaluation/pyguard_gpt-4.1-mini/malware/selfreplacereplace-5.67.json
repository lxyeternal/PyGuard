      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions, indicating an attempt to hide malicious activity. The check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests conditional execution to evade analysis or ensure persistence. The presence of this code inside a setup script (which runs during package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution during installation. The author and email fields appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate software. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution triggered during package installation without user consent."
