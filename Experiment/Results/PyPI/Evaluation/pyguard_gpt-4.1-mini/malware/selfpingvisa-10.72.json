      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a conditional execution pattern often used to avoid repeated execution or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command with encoded payload and hidden window style is a hallmark of malware attempting to run code covertly during package setup. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, which is likely a decoy or a cover for the malicious payload execution. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially supply chain attacks where malicious code is embedded in setup scripts to execute arbitrary commands without user consent."
