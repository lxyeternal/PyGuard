      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which decodes to a PowerShell invocation that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and runs it hidden from the user. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which is a common evasion or staging tactic. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation, without any user interaction or consent, embedded in a setup script context, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The domain used is unrelated to the package's stated purpose and is suspicious. The subprocess call suppresses the window and runs the command silently, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is used as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a potentially malicious executable on Windows systems during package installation or import, which is a critical security risk."
