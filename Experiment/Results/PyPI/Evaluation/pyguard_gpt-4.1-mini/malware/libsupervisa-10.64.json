      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions silently, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The presence of this code inside a setup script (which runs during package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. The author and email fields appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate packages. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation without user consent."
