      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate Python package. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command is a classic malware pattern to execute hidden payloads. This code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation without user consent, a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, the combination of hidden PowerShell execution, encoded commands, suspicious directory checks, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
