      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the package metadata author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest an attempt to disguise or mislead. The use of subprocess to run a hidden PowerShell encoded command during the setup process (package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as execution of obfuscated shell commands during installation, use of hidden PowerShell windows, encoded payloads, and suppression of exceptions to avoid detection. Therefore, this code is malicious."
