      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of malware. The command is triggered conditionally if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating staging or persistence behavior. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious payloads during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy or cover to appear as a legitimate package. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden execution of a remote or encoded payload during installation, with no user consent or validation, classifies this code as malicious."
