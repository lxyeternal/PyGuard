      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known vector for executing arbitrary code during package installation (a supply chain attack pattern). Inside the overridden run() method, it conditionally executes code only on Windows (os.name == 'nt'). It imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules dynamically and then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is then executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution from an obfuscated source. The payload is embedded in the setup.py install hook, which means it runs automatically without user consent during package installation. The use of cryptography to hide the payload, dynamic imports, and execution of decrypted code during install time are all hallmark indicators of malicious intent. The package metadata fields (name, author, description) appear obfuscated or nonsensical, further suggesting an attempt to hide malicious activity. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, enabling remote code execution and potential further payload delivery or system compromise."
