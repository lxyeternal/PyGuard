      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file named 'image.png' from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://wpp-api-01hw.onrender.com/api/images/1140884481671188581/image.png) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this file to the user's AppData directory, which is a common location for malware to hide payloads. The content of this file is then base64-decoded and executed dynamically using exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution from a remote source. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. The absence of validation, user notification, or integrity checks on the downloaded file further elevates the risk. The rest of the code defines a proxy management class, which by itself is not malicious, but combined with the initial behavior, it suggests the code is designed to perform network operations potentially to evade detection or communicate with command-and-control servers. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators such as hardcoded suspicious URL, writing and executing remote code without consent, and use of base64 decoding with exec(), confirming malicious intent."
