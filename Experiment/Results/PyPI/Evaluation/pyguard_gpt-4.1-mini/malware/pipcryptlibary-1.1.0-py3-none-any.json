      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: 1) It installs a large number of Python packages without user consent, including suspicious or uncommon ones. 2) It attempts to copy the 'Cryptodome' package directory to 'Crypto', a known technique to bypass certain import issues but also used in malware for cryptographic operations. 3) It writes a Python script ('pl.py') containing an encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed at runtime using the 'fernet' module, which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique to hide malicious payloads. 4) It runs this decrypted payload in a hidden subprocess, suppressing any window, which is a stealth technique. 5) It downloads a Python script from a suspicious external URL ('https://kekwltd.ru/run.py') and writes it to the Windows Startup folder, setting the file as hidden, which establishes persistence by running the script on user login. 6) It attempts to execute the downloaded script immediately in a hidden subprocess. 7) The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection and error reporting. 8) The use of hardcoded, non-standard external URLs for downloading and executing code without validation or user interaction is a critical red flag. These combined behaviors—dynamic decryption and execution of payloads, stealthy process spawning, persistence via Startup folder, and downloading/executing remote code—are hallmark traits of malware, indicating the code is malicious."
