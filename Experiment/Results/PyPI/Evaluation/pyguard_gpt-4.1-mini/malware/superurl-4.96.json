      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. This execution happens immediately upon running the script, without user interaction or consent, and is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command with encoded payload and hidden window style is a hallmark of malware attempting to run arbitrary code stealthily. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior."
