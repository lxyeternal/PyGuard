      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class (GruppeInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). This means arbitrary code execution occurs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload and exec() in the install hook is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling stealthy execution of potentially malicious code. The package name 'requetsts' is a typo-squatting of the legitimate 'requests' package, which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The encrypted payload and the dynamic execution strongly indicate malicious intent, as it hides the true behavior of the code and bypasses static analysis. The setup script also specifies dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated payload, execution at install time, dynamic imports, and no user notification or consent, all consistent with malicious behavior."
