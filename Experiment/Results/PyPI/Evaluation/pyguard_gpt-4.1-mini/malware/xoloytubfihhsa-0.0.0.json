      "malicious_behavior": "The code is malicious because it stealthily collects sensitive authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers using the browser_cookie3 library without user consent. It then validates the cookie and, if valid, gathers detailed user information from Roblox APIs, including user ID, RAP, friends count, account age, creation date, username, robux balance, premium status, and IP address. All this sensitive information, including the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie itself, is exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external, attacker-controlled endpoint. The code performs this data theft silently without user interaction or notification, which is a classic pattern of credential theft and data exfiltration malware. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL, automated cookie stealing from browsers, validation, and immediate exfiltration of sensitive account credentials and personal data clearly indicates malicious intent."
