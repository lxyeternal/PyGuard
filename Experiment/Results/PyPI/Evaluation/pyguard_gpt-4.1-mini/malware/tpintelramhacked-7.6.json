      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64 string that, when decoded, likely contains a PowerShell script that downloads or executes further malicious payloads from a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. This execution happens immediately upon import or setup, without any user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The domain used (discordapp.com attachments) is not a standard or trusted source for package resources and is often abused for malware hosting. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy or cover, with plausible package metadata but no legitimate logic. The combination of these factors—hidden execution of encoded PowerShell commands, use of suspicious external URLs, execution during package setup, and suppression of errors—matches multiple critical risk patterns associated with malware, including remote code execution, stealth payload delivery, and potential persistence mechanisms."
