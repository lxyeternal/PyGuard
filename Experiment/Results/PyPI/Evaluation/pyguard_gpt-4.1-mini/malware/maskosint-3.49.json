      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in a setup script context, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a hallmark of malware aiming for stealthy code execution, potentially for downloading or executing further malicious payloads. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is used as a cover for this malicious execution. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and should be classified as malicious."
