      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding, including hex-encoded strings, base64 decoding, and dynamic evaluation via eval and exec. It imports modules dynamically and reconstructs code at runtime, which is then executed. The code contains a large embedded base64-encoded and likely compressed payload that is decoded and executed dynamically. Such behavior is a classic hallmark of malware, as it hides the true intent and payload from static analysis. The use of eval on decoded data, dynamic imports, and execution of shell commands without user interaction or consent strongly indicates malicious intent. The obfuscation and payload execution pattern matches known malware techniques for remote code execution, payload delivery, and evasion of detection. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
