      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated PowerShell payloads stealthily without user awareness. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup or import is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution without user consent. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, which may be used to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, conditional execution based on file system state, and execution during package setup, all consistent with malware behavior."
