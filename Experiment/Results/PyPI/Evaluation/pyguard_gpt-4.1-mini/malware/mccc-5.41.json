      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user consent or interaction, and is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. These factors combined—hidden execution, obfuscated payload, conditional execution, and embedding in setup—are strong indicators of malicious intent."
