      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The PowerShell command references a suspicious GitHub raw URL (github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe), which is likely a payload download or execution attempt. This behavior is embedded in a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, further indicating an attempt to hide failures and avoid detection. The presence of this code in a setup script (using distutils.core.setup) suggests it is triggered during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. These factors collectively indicate that the code is designed to stealthily download and execute a potentially malicious payload without user consent, fulfilling multiple critical risk indicators of malware."
