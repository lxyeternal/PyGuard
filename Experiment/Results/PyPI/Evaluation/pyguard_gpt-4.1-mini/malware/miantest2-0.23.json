      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that executes during package installation without user interaction or consent. It collects the hostname and IP address of the host machine and asynchronously sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of system information to an external endpoint. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL in an install hook, combined with network communication during installation, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission during installation, and no user notification or consent is obtained. This pattern aligns with known supply chain attack vectors where malicious code executes at install time to exfiltrate sensitive environment data."
