      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding, including hex escapes, base64 decoding, and eval calls. It dynamically imports modules and decodes large blocks of encoded data, which are then executed at runtime. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used to hide the true behavior of malware and evade static analysis. The code uses eval on decoded data, which can execute arbitrary code, a critical red flag. The obfuscation and dynamic execution suggest the code is designed to download, decode, and run hidden payloads without user consent or interaction. Such behavior aligns with known malware techniques including remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential data exfiltration. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
