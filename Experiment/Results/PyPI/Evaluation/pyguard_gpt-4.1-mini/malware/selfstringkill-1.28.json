      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the legitimate package description. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command is a common malware pattern to execute hidden payloads. The code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The try-except blocks suppress all exceptions, hiding any errors and making detection harder. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell payload during installation without user consent, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
