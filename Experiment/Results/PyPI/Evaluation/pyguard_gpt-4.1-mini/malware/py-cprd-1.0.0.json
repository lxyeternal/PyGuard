      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior due to the following reasons: 1) It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known vector for executing arbitrary code during package installation (a supply chain attack vector). 2) Inside the overridden run() method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt a hardcoded encrypted payload. 3) The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution from an obfuscated source. 4) The code only executes this payload on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), indicating targeted behavior. 5) The use of a hardcoded cryptographic key and ciphertext to hide the payload is a strong evasion technique to bypass static analysis. 6) The package setup metadata is obfuscated with meaningless strings, which is typical in malicious packages to avoid detection. 7) The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only for the malicious payload execution, indicating dependency installation solely for malicious purposes. 8) There is no user interaction, notification, or consent before executing the decrypted code during installation, which is a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, encrypted malicious code during package installation on Windows systems without user consent, which is a critical security risk."
