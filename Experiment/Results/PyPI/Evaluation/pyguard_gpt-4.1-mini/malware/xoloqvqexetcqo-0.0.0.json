      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily extract sensitive authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers (Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome) using the browser_cookie3 library without user consent. It then validates the stolen cookie using robloxpy and, if valid, collects detailed user account information including UserID, RAP, friends count, account age, creation date, username, robux balance, premium status, and IP address. All this sensitive information, including the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie itself, is exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code operates without any user interaction or notification, silently sending stolen credentials and personal data to an external endpoint controlled by an attacker. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious code, including unauthorized credential theft, data exfiltration to a hardcoded external URL, absence of user consent, and use of network communication libraries for covert data transmission. Therefore, this code is malicious and constitutes a credential-stealing malware targeting Roblox users."
