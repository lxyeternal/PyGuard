      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that execute a function 'notmalfunc' immediately after installation or development setup. This function collects all environment variables from the host system, URL-encodes them, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL hosted on an ngrok-free.app domain. This behavior constitutes unauthorized exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard external URL for data transmission during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector. The code triggers this data exfiltration automatically during package installation or development setup, which is a high-risk malicious pattern. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this network activity, and the environment data sent may contain sensitive information. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware embedded in a Python package installation process."
