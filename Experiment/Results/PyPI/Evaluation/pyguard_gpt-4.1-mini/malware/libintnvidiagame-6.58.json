      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate Python package. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover, with innocuous metadata but no real package logic. The combination of executing an obfuscated PowerShell command in a hidden window during package setup, without user consent or interaction, is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malware. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as: - Execution of hidden PowerShell with encoded commands - Obfuscation via base64-encoded UTF-16LE payload - Conditional execution based on directory existence - Use of subprocess to spawn hidden processes - Malicious code embedded in setup/install script - Suspicious author and domain metadata - Suppression of exceptions to avoid detection Overall, this code is designed to execute a stealthy, obfuscated payload on Windows systems during package installation or execution, which is a hallmark of malicious activity."
