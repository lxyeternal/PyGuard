      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior due to the following reasons: It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known vector for executing arbitrary code during package installation (a supply chain attack vector). Inside the overridden run() method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on the output of Fernet decryption with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This means that arbitrary, encrypted payload code is executed at install time without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload and exec() is a strong indicator of obfuscation and malicious intent, as it hides the true behavior of the code from static analysis. The code only executes this payload on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), which is a common tactic to target specific platforms. The package setup metadata is obfuscated with meaningless strings for description and author fields, which is suspicious. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious payload execution context. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware: arbitrary code execution during installation, obfuscated encrypted payload, dynamic import and execution of network-related modules, and no legitimate application logic surrounding these actions."
