      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, indicating covert execution. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or persistence tactic. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The malicious payload is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, abusing the package installation process to trigger execution, a common supply chain attack vector. The subprocess call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the setup() call appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, the use of suspicious directory checks, and encoded commands strongly classify this code as malicious."
