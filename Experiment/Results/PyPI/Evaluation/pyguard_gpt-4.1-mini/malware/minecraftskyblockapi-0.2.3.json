      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It targets multiple popular browsers and Discord clients to extract sensitive data such as saved passwords, cookies, and Discord tokens. The code uses Windows DPAPI (win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData) and AES-GCM decryption to decrypt encrypted credentials and cookies from browser files, indicating intent to access protected user data without consent. It collects Discord tokens from local storage files using regex and decryption. The harvested data is written to local text files named with the current username, which are then exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL and optionally to a Telegram bot endpoint (though the Telegram token and chat ID are placeholders). The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code performs these actions silently without user interaction or notification, and deletes the local files after exfiltration to cover tracks. The overall behavior matches typical credential stealer malware patterns: enumerating user data directories, decrypting stored credentials, collecting tokens, writing sensitive data to files, and exfiltrating to attacker-controlled endpoints. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent involved. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed for unauthorized credential theft and data exfiltration."
