      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It contains a large block of obfuscated and encoded data, which is decoded using base64 and base32, then decompressed with zlib, and finally decrypted using the cryptography.fernet module with a hardcoded key. The decrypted payload is then dynamically deserialized and executed via eval/exec, which is a classic technique for hiding malicious payloads and evading static analysis. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, and the main payload is executed through an indirect call to exec on the deserialized data. This pattern is a hallmark of malware, enabling arbitrary code execution from an obfuscated and encrypted source. Additionally, the code imports cryptography and performs decryption without any legitimate application logic or user interaction, further confirming its malicious intent. The presence of such obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic execution strongly suggests that the code is designed to conceal and execute malicious payloads, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment."
