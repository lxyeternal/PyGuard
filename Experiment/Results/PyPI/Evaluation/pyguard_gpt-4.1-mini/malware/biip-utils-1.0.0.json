      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools' install command to execute arbitrary code during package installation without user consent, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Specifically, in the GruppeInstall.run method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), enabling arbitrary code execution. The use of encrypted payload and exec() in an install hook is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true behavior and executes code dynamically at install time. The obfuscated DESCRIPTION and LONG_DESCRIPTION strings further suggest an attempt to conceal the package's true purpose. The code only triggers on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), which may be an evasion technique. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) in setup_requires also supports the likelihood of malicious network activity or payload retrieval. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution during installation, obfuscated and encrypted payloads, and lack of user interaction or notification."
