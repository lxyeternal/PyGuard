      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that, immediately after the standard installation or development setup, collect all environment variables from the host system and send them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://eewtrzyimp165no1u4kqfhv0nrtih95y.oastify.com). This behavior occurs silently during package installation or development setup without any user interaction or consent. The exfiltration of environment variables, which may contain sensitive information such as credentials, tokens, or configuration secrets, to an untrusted external server is a classic hallmark of malicious activity, specifically information stealing or reconnaissance. The use of a non-standard, suspicious domain and embedding this network communication in the installation hooks (setup.py commands) strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this data exfiltration, no error handling or user notification, and no benign context for sending all environment variables externally. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
