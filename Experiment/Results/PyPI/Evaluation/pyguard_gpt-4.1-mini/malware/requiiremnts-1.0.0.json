      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). This means arbitrary code execution occurs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution in the install hook is a classic supply chain attack vector. The package name 'requiiremnts' is a typo-squatting attempt to mimic 'requirements'. The description and long description are nonsensical and likely obfuscation. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated payload, execution at install time, use of cryptography to hide payload, and execution of arbitrary code without user consent. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to execute hidden payloads on Windows systems during package installation."
