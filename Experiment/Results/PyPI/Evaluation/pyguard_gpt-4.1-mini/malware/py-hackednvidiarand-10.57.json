      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated PowerShell payloads stealthily. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing this hidden command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure persistence. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled entity. The execution of this PowerShell command during the setup process (package installation) without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command to spawn a hidden process is a strong indicator of stealthy malicious payload execution. The rest of the setup() call appears to be a decoy or to disguise the package as a legitimate library, but the primary malicious action is the hidden PowerShell execution. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution triggered during package installation."
