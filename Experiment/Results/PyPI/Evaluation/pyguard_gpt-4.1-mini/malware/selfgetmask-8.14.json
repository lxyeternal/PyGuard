      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package repository. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command string is unusual and likely to spawn a hidden process without user consent or interaction. This code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and use of suspicious external references, all pointing to malicious intent."
