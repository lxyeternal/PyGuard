      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the stated package purpose. The setup() call appears to be a decoy to disguise the malicious code within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. This pattern of executing hidden, encoded PowerShell commands during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution without user consent or awareness. Therefore, this code is malicious."
