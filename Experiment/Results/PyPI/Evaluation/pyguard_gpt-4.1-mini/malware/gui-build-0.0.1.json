      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup.py installation script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. During the install and develop commands, it executes a function that downloads an executable file named 'Cleaner.exe' from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://a4a08d21-3950-435e-8b39-12ab7788cd10.id.repl.co/Cleaner.exe) without any user interaction or consent. The downloaded executable is written directly to disk and then executed via os.system with a command that attempts to run it with 'RunAsInvoker' privilege level, which is a known technique to bypass elevation prompts or restrictions. There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification about this download and execution. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded URL, combined with automatic download and execution of an external binary during package installation, is a classic hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. This behavior enables remote code execution on the victim's system without their knowledge, posing a critical security risk."
