      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware (stealer). It collects sensitive data such as browser cookies, saved passwords, Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Minecraft files, system information (including Windows keys, hardware IDs, IP geolocation), and screenshots. It decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption, indicating intent to extract protected credentials. The code exfiltrates this data to attacker-controlled Discord webhooks and uploads files to anonymous file hosting services. It also attempts clipboard hijacking by replacing cryptocurrency wallet addresses with attacker-controlled addresses, a known theft technique. The code includes anti-debugging and anti-VM checks to evade analysis. It modifies the Windows startup folder for persistence and attempts to inject malicious JavaScript into Discord client files to maintain access. The presence of hardcoded Discord webhook URLs, extensive use of threading for stealth, silent exception handling, and network communication without user consent further confirm malicious intent. Overall, this code is a sophisticated credential and token stealer designed to surreptitiously harvest and exfiltrate sensitive user data."
