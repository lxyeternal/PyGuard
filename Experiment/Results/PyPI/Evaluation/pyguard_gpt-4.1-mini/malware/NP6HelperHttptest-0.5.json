      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command in a Python package setup script that, during installation, downloads two executable files from a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/). It writes these files to a temporary directory with a suspicious prefix ('DriverGenius'), then immediately executes one of the downloaded files ('ComServer.exe') with a command-line argument ('showdeskband') without any user interaction, consent, or validation. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, where arbitrary code is fetched and executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system. The use of hardcoded, non-standard domain names, writing and running executables from a temp directory, and execution triggered automatically during install are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding these actions, and no error handling or validation of the downloaded content. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks."
