      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens during the package setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. The rest of the setup.py code appears benign, but the presence of this hidden, encoded PowerShell execution triggered during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
