      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. This execution occurs during the setup process, which is a classic supply chain attack vector to run malicious code upon package installation without user consent. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, combined with the lack of error handling and silent exception suppression, strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at executing unauthorized code stealthily. Therefore, this code is malicious."
