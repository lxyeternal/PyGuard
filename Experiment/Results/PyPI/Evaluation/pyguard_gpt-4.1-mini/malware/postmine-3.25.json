      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens during the import phase of the setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands and no user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
