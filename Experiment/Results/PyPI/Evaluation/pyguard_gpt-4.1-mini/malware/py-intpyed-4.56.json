      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the stated package purpose. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a cover or delivery mechanism. The combination of executing hidden, encoded PowerShell commands during package setup, with no user interaction or consent, is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package installation, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
