      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) that is unrelated to the package's stated purpose, suggesting it may download or execute further malicious payloads. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation, without user consent or interaction, embedded in a setup script context, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The package metadata uses misleading names and author information (e.g., 'EsqueleSquad', 'py-nvidiapepcontrol') to appear legitimate. All these factors combined—hidden execution of encoded PowerShell commands, suspicious external URL, execution during setup, and evasion techniques—are strong indicators of malicious intent."
