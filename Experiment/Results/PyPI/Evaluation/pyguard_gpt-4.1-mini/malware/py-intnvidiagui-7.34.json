      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It conditionally checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and if it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script, which is a known obfuscation technique to evade detection and analysis. The use of hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands is a hallmark of malware attempting stealthy code execution. The encoded command references a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) which is unrelated to the stated purpose of the package and is likely used to download or execute further malicious payloads. This execution happens without user interaction or consent, triggered during the setup script execution, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup.py code appears to be a decoy or cover, presenting itself as a legitimate package setup, but the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent."
