      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is executed via subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW, suppressing any visible window, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The command is only run if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated detection or analysis. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The use of obfuscated, encoded commands, hidden execution, and conditional checks for specific directories aligns with multiple critical risk patterns associated with malware, including stealthy payload delivery, persistence, and evasion. Therefore, this code is malicious."
