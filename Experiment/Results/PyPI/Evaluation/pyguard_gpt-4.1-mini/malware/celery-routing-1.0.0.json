      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, after running the standard install process, it collects system information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com). This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: it executes code during package installation without user consent, collects potentially sensitive system information, and exfiltrates it to an external, non-standard domain unrelated to the package's stated purpose. The use of a hardcoded, suspicious URL for data exfiltration during install time is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this network activity. Therefore, this code is malicious."
