      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and a package identifier, then encodes this data in base64 and further hex-encodes it. It constructs domain names by appending this encoded data to a suspicious DNS domain ('.sub.deliverycontent.online') and performs multiple 'ping' commands to these domains, which is a covert channel technique often used for data exfiltration via DNS queries. Additionally, the code sends the encoded data via HTTP POST and GET requests to hardcoded, suspicious external domains ('www.deliverycontent.online') using multiple HTTP client libraries (urllib.request, requests, urllib), attempting to exfiltrate the collected system information. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection or error reporting. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying these network activities. The use of obfuscated data encoding, hardcoded suspicious domains, environment fingerprinting, and multiple network exfiltration methods strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance components of a larger attack. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
