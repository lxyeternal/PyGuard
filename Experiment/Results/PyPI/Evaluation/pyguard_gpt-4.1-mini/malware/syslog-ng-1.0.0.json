      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, after running the standard install process, it collects system information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (fo7288ar9hjgo6tp8p6c1efxpovgja7z.oastify.com). This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns: it executes network communication during package installation without user consent, exfiltrates potentially sensitive system information to an attacker-controlled domain, uses a non-standard and suspicious URL unrelated to the package's stated purpose, and embeds this exfiltration in the install hook, which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data transmission. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware and supply chain attack techniques."
