      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common method to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or sandbox environments. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup or import is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload execution. The silent exception handling (except: pass) suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands on Windows systems during package installation or import, which is a hallmark of malware."
