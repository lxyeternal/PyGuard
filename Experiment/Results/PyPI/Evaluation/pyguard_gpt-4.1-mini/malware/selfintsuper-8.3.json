      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions, indicating an attempt to hide malicious activity. The check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests conditional execution to evade analysis or repeated execution. The presence of this code in a setup script (commonly run during package installation) indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation without user awareness. The author and email fields appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate software, further supporting malicious intent. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and lack of user consent, confirming it is malicious."
