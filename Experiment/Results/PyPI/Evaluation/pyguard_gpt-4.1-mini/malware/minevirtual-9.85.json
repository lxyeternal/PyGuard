      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. This behavior is suspicious because it executes obfuscated code without user consent or interaction, in a hidden window, and is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of this hidden, encoded PowerShell execution alongside it strongly indicates malicious intent."
