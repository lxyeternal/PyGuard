      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information including hostname, username, current working directory, and a suspicious package name, then encodes this data in base64 and further hex-encodes it. It constructs domain names by appending this encoded data to a suspicious external DNS domain ('.sub.deliverycontent.online') and performs multiple 'ping' commands to these domains, which is a covert channel technique often used for data exfiltration via DNS queries. Additionally, it sends the encoded data via HTTP POST and GET requests to hardcoded suspicious external domains ('www.deliverycontent.online') using multiple HTTP libraries (urllib.request, requests, urllib), suppressing all exceptions to avoid detection. The absence of any legitimate application logic, user interaction, or consent, combined with the obfuscation of data and the use of hardcoded, non-standard external domains for network communication, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving system fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers."
