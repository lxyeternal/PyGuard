      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. This is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used by malware to evade detection. The encoded PowerShell command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows execution of arbitrary code without user consent or interaction. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, enabling code execution during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. The silent exception handling (except: pass) suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including stealthy execution, obfuscation, conditional payload execution, and embedding in an installation script."
