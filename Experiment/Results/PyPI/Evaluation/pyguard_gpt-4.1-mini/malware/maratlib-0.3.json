      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated variable and function names and includes a function (l111_cringe_) that decodes and evaluates obfuscated strings via eval, which is a classic code injection and obfuscation technique. Most critically, the code executes a shell command via os.system during the package setup process that downloads a shell script from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://github.com/nedog123/files/raw/main/aza-ob.sh) to /tmp/gay.sh, sets its permissions to be fully executable, and immediately executes it. This pattern is a textbook example of a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery triggered during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of setup.py to trigger remote code download and execution, combined with obfuscation and eval, confirms the code is malicious."
