      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or to detect analysis environments. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code is embedded in installation scripts. The subprocess call is placed outside of any user interaction or consent mechanism, meaning it executes automatically during import or installation. These factors combined—hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell command, suppression of windows, obfuscation, and embedding in a setup script—are strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with known malware patterns."
