      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command is a classic malware technique to execute arbitrary code without user consent or interaction. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious payloads during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload execution. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection and error reporting. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including stealthy execution, obfuscation, conditional payload execution, and embedding in an installation script."
