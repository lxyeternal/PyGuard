      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a hallmark of malware aiming for stealthy code execution, potentially for downloading or running further malicious payloads. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious."
