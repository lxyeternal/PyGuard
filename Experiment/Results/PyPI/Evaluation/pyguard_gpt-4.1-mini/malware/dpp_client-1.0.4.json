      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes multiple shell commands to gather sensitive system information, including the current working directory ('pwd'), the current user ('whoami'), the hostname ('hostname'), directory listings of parent directories ('ls -la ../' and 'ls -la ../../'), and the contents of the sensitive system file '/etc/passwd'. It then encodes all this collected data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL 'http://pt.traktrain.com/req.php' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration. Furthermore, this data collection and exfiltration occur in the setup script context, which means it will execute during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The combination of gathering sensitive information, exfiltrating it to an external, non-standard domain, and doing so silently during package installation strongly indicates malicious intent."
