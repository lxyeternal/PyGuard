      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious Discord token and credential stealer. It collects Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Chrome passwords, and cookies by accessing local application data and decrypting stored credentials using Windows DPAPI. It then exfiltrates this sensitive information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code also attempts to bypass Discord token protection and BetterDiscord integrity checks, kills Discord processes optionally, hides itself by setting file attributes, and can copy itself to the Windows startup folder for persistence. It downloads and injects malicious JavaScript code into Discord's desktop core modules, enabling further compromise. The use of threading to run multiple stealing functions concurrently, silent exception handling, and removal of temporary files indicate anti-forensic behavior. The code collects detailed system and network information (IP, location, hardware specs, Windows product key) and sends it along with stolen credentials to the attacker-controlled webhook. All these behaviors—credential theft, data exfiltration, persistence, process manipulation, and code injection—are classic hallmarks of malware."
