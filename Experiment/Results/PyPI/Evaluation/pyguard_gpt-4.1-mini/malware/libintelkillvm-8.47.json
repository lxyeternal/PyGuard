      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64 string that, when decoded, points to a suspicious URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/107974949475150594048/Esquele.exe) and downloads an executable named 'x/WindowsCache.exe', which is then executed silently with no user consent or interaction. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory 'tahg' before executing this payload, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or ensure environment suitability. This behavior is embedded in the setup script, which means it triggers during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The domain and file names are unrelated to the declared package purpose and author, and the author email and package name appear suspicious or misleading. All these factors combined—hidden execution, encoded PowerShell command, downloading and running an executable from a non-standard URL, conditional execution based on directory presence, and embedding in setup.py—are classic hallmarks of malware and supply chain attacks."
