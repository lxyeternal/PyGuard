      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) that appears to download and execute an executable file named 'Esquele.exe' in a hidden window, without any user interaction or consent. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. Additionally, the malicious payload is embedded within a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and automatic execution during package installation. The use of a suspicious author name and email (EsqueleSquad, tahgoficial@proton.me) and the presence of a suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) further support the malicious intent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a potentially malicious executable on Windows systems during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
