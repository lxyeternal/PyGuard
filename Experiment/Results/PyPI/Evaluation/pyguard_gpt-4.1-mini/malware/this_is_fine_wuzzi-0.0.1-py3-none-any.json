      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads content from a given URL without any validation or user consent, writes it to a randomly named folder inside the system temporary directory, and immediately executes the downloaded file using subprocess.run. This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution from untrusted remote sources. The use of a random folder name in the temp directory is a common evasion technique to avoid detection. There is no error handling or user notification, and the downloaded content is executed directly, which can lead to remote code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise. According to the provided knowledge points, this sequence is strongly associated with malware and is a critical risk indicator."
