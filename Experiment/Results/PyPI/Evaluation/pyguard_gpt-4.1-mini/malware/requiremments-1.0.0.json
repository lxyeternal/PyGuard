      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute arbitrary code during installation without user consent. The run() method conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing obfuscated code at install time is a strong indicator of malicious intent and is commonly used in supply chain attacks. The obfuscated class name and nonsensical description strings further suggest an attempt to evade detection. The code only executes this payload on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), which is typical for targeted attacks. The use of encrypted payloads, dynamic imports, and execution during installation without transparency or user interaction aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution, stealth, and potential for further payload delivery or system compromise."
