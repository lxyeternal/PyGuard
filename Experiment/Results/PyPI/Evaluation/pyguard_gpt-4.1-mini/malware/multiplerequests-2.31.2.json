      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. After the standard setuptools.setup call, it performs a network request to a suspicious, hardcoded URL (https://frvezdffvv.pythonanywhere.com/getpackage) unrelated to the package's stated purpose. The response content is directly used as a base64-encoded payload that is written into a Python script file in the user's roaming AppData directory, a common location for malware persistence. The script then immediately executes this file using subprocess.Popen without any user consent, validation, or error handling. This sequence—downloading obfuscated code from an untrusted external source, writing it to a hidden location, and executing it dynamically—is a classic pattern of remote code execution and payload delivery used by malware. The use of base64 decoding combined with exec further confirms obfuscation and intent to hide the payload's true nature. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying these actions. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
