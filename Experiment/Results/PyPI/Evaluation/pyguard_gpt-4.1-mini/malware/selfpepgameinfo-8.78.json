      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) which is unrelated to the stated package purpose and likely used to download or execute a malicious payload. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution occurs during the setup process of a Python package, which is a known supply chain attack vector, allowing arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The use of try-except blocks suppresses any errors, further hiding malicious activity. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden window style, suspicious external URL, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
