      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the stack trace, environment variable keys, system uname data, and the public IP address of the host machine without any user interaction or consent. It then encodes this data into a JSON payload and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, base64-obfuscated URL (https://hooks.slack.com/services/...). This URL is a Slack webhook endpoint, which is commonly abused for covert data exfiltration. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL, the unconditional network communication on import/execution, and the exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the script terminates immediately after sending the data (exit(1)), which is typical behavior to avoid further execution or detection. The code also attempts to evade analysis by skipping execution if run on known bot hostnames or filenames. These behaviors align with known malware patterns of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints without user consent."
