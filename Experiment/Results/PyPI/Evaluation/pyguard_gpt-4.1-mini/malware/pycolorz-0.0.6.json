      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior. It writes a temporary Python script file containing a one-liner that fetches and executes code from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/39kv9/raw) without any user interaction or consent. This remote code execution via exec() on network-fetched data is a classic hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. Furthermore, the code immediately executes this downloaded script using os.system with a command that launches a new Python interpreter process, which is a strong indicator of arbitrary code execution. The entire sequence is embedded in the package setup script, meaning the malicious payload is triggered during package installation, a known vector for supply chain attacks. There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification before downloading and executing remote code. These behaviors align with critical risk patterns such as remote payload retrieval, dynamic code execution, execution during installation, and use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, all of which are strong indicators of malicious intent."
