      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed without user consent or interaction, and the subprocess is launched only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade detection or analysis. This behavior is embedded in the setup script, which means it triggers during package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, execution during package installation, and conditional evasion checks, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
