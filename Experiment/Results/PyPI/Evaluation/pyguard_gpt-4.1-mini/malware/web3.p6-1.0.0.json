      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute hidden malicious code during installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). It imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules dynamically and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing obfuscated code at install time without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malware. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during setup installation strongly suggests intent to execute arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the code is designed to run stealthily during package installation, which is a critical risk behavior consistent with malicious Python packages."
