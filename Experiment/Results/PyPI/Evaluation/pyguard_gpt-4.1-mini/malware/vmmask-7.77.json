      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens during the package setup process, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and unauthorized code execution during installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. The use of subprocess to run hidden PowerShell with an encoded command, combined with the lack of user interaction or consent, and the obfuscation of the payload, are strong indicators of malicious intent."
