      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated string construction and variable names to hide its intent. The code executes during the package setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. It imports modules dynamically and attempts to install packages via pip programmatically. It performs environment checks, including administrative privilege checks, and manipulates system directories and files in user home paths. The code creates and writes files with obfuscated names in user directories, uses Windows COM objects to create and save shortcuts, and performs recursive directory walking to find and manipulate files with suspicious extensions. It also uses obfuscated loops and conditions to control execution flow, including writing and executing files without user consent. These behaviors align with typical malware patterns such as persistence setup, payload deployment, and evasion techniques. The absence of legitimate application logic, combined with obfuscation, dynamic code execution, file system manipulation, and execution of shell commands during installation, confirms that this code is malicious."
