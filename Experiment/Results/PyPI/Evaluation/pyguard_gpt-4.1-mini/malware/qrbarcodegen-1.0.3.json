      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class 'Updater' that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, it constructs a hardcoded URL (https://filebin.net/95iifmxlei9dcctd/qrcodegen.py) from obfuscated string fragments and performs an HTTP GET request to download a Python script named 'qrcodegen.py'. It then writes this downloaded content directly to disk without any validation or user consent and immediately executes it using subprocess.check_call with the current Python interpreter. This behavior constitutes arbitrary remote code execution triggered automatically during package installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names to build the URL, the lack of error handling or user notification, and the execution of externally fetched code without integrity checks or signatures are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote payload retrieval, execution during install time, obfuscation, and lack of transparency. Therefore, this code is malicious."
