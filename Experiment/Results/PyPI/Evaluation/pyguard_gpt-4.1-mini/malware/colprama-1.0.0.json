      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'GruppeInstall' that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is hardcoded and decrypted at install time, then executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag for arbitrary code execution. This behavior occurs silently during package installation without user interaction or consent, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of encrypted payload hides the true intent of the code, evading static analysis. The presence of network-related modules (requests) imported only in this context suggests potential network activity or further malicious actions within the decrypted payload. The package metadata and descriptions are obfuscated and meaningless, further indicating an attempt to disguise malicious intent. Overall, this pattern matches multiple high-risk and critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, and use of encrypted payloads executed without user consent."
