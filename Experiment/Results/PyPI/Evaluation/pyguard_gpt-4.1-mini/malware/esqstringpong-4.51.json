      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package repository. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during the setup process (package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the setup.py code appears to be a decoy or cover, presenting itself as a legitimate package setup script. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution triggered during package installation."
