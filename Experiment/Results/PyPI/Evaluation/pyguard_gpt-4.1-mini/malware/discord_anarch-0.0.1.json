      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports the module 'nukebot' from 'discord_ghost'. The name 'nukebot' strongly suggests malicious intent, as 'nuke' in the context of Discord bots typically refers to destructive actions such as mass deletion of channels, messages, or server disruption. The module name 'discord_ghost' is not a standard or widely recognized library and may be a custom or third-party package designed for malicious purposes. Given the context and naming, this import likely enables or triggers malicious behavior related to Discord server disruption or unauthorized automated actions. Although the code snippet itself only shows an import statement, the imported module's name and context align with known malicious patterns involving Discord nuking bots, which are used to cause harm or disruption without user consent. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and likely malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a class 'Nuker' that uses a Discord authorization token to perform destructive actions on Discord servers, such as banning members, kicking members, deleting channels, creating channels, and creating webhooks via direct Discord API HTTP requests. The class also includes a method 'init_nuker' that writes a Python script to the Windows Startup folder (a persistence mechanism) without user consent, downloading the script from a hardcoded external URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1104467401241808966/1104469233695473775/main.py) and then executes it asynchronously in a new thread using os.system. This behavior is a classic malware pattern: it downloads and executes potentially untrusted code from the internet, installs persistence by placing the script in the startup folder, and performs unauthorized destructive actions on Discord servers using the provided token. The absence of user interaction, the use of hardcoded external URLs, writing to a sensitive system directory (Windows Startup folder), and executing downloaded code without validation or notification are strong indicators of malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
