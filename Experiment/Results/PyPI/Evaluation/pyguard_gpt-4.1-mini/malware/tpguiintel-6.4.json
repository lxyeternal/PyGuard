      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the stated package purpose. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a cover for the malicious payload execution. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command string is unusual and likely to spawn a hidden process without user consent. This pattern is a classic indicator of malware attempting to execute a hidden payload during package installation or execution, consistent with supply chain attack vectors. Therefore, this code is malicious."
