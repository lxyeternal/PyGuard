      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens during the import or setup phase without any user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden, encoded PowerShell execution in the setup script strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, encoded PowerShell payload, execution during package installation, and obfuscation, all of which are hallmark signs of malware."
