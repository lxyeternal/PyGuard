      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. This execution happens silently without user consent or notification, and the subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The presence of a suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) also raise suspicion. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, but the embedded hidden execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during import or installation is a classic supply chain attack vector. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution from obfuscated sources during package installation or import, without user interaction or transparency."
