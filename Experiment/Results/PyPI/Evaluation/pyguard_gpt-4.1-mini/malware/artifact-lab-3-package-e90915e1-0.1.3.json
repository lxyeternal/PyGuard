      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a base64-decoding function that decodes an obfuscated shell command. This command uses 'curl' to download data from a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://ac9c-54-204-140-51.ngrok-free.app) and executes it immediately via os.system without any user interaction or consent. The execution is triggered automatically during both the 'install' and 'develop' phases of the setuptools package installation process by subclassing and overriding the install and develop commands. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system during package installation. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL and command, the hardcoded suspicious external domain, and the automatic execution during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent."
