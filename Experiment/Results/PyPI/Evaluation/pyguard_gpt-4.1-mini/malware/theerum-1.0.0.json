      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, encrypted payload, and execution during package installation strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector. The code also specifies dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests' which are used only in the malicious install hook. The encrypted payload is not visible in plaintext, preventing static analysis of its true intent, but the pattern of decrypting and executing code during installation is a hallmark of malware. This behavior enables remote code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, which is a critical security risk and consistent with malicious activity."
