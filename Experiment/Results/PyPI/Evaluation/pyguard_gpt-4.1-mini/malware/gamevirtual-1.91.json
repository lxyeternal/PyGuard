      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' and only then executes the hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure environment suitability. This execution happens during the package setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses all exceptions, further indicating an attempt to hide failures or detection. Overall, the presence of hidden, encoded PowerShell execution triggered during installation, combined with obfuscation and silent failure handling, is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
