      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python snippet to a temporary file that imports urllib.request and executes code fetched from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/bjhtk/raw) without any validation or user consent. It then attempts to execute this temporary file using a system call that launches a new Python interpreter process. This dynamic fetching and execution of remote code during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of obfuscated imports and variable names, writing and executing a temporary file, and silent exception handling further support the malicious nature. The code effectively enables arbitrary remote code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, which is a critical security risk."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically writes a Python script to a temporary file that contains an exec() call on code fetched directly from a hardcoded external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/yg9e5/raw). This downloaded code is executed without any validation or user consent, which is a critical red flag. Immediately after writing the file, the code attempts to execute it via a shell command using os.system, launching a new Python process to run the downloaded script. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code without user interaction or validation—is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, enabling arbitrary code execution and potential system compromise. The use of obfuscated imports and variable names, silent exception handling, and execution of a temporary file further supports the malicious classification. According to the provided knowledge points, this sequence is strongly associated with malware and is a high-risk indicator of remote code execution and payload delivery."
