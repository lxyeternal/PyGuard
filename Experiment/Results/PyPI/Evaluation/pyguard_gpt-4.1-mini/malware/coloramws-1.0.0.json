      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known vector for executing arbitrary code during package installation (a supply chain attack pattern). Inside the overridden run() method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. This execution happens silently during installation without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution is a strong evasion technique to hide malicious intent. The package metadata fields (name, author, description) are obfuscated and meaningless, further indicating an attempt to disguise malicious activity. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only for the malicious payload execution. The code only triggers on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), suggesting targeted malicious behavior. Overall, this pattern matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk indicators of malware, including code execution at install time, obfuscation, encrypted payload execution, and use of network libraries for potential further malicious actions."
