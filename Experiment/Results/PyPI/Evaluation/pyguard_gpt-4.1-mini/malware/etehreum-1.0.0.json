      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class names, hardcoded cryptographic keys, encrypted payloads, and execution of decrypted code at install time strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the package setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this hidden payload execution. The code lacks any legitimate application logic surrounding this network or execution activity, and the payload is executed silently during installation, which is a critical risk pattern associated exclusively with malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
