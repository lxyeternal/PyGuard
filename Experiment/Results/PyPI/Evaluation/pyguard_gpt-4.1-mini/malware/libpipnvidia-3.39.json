      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. This execution happens silently without user consent or interaction, and the subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window. The presence of this encoded, hidden PowerShell execution within a setup script (commonly run during package installation) strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution is a critical red flag for malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
