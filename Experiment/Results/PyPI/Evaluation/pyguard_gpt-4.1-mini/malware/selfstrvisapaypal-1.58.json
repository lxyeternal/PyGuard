      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common method to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure persistence. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The package metadata includes suspicious author information and a non-standard package name, further indicating malicious intent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during installation, a hallmark of malicious Python packages."
