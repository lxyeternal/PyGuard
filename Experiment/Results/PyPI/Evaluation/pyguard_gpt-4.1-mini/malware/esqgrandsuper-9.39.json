      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to hide the actual command content. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup or import is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for downloading or executing further payloads without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, which may be used to mask the malicious activity. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, and execution triggered during package installation or import, confirming its malicious nature."
