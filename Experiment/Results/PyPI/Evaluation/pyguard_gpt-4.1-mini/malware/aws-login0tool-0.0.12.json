      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class 'SneakyInstall' that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL ('https://tryg.ga/syswin32.exe') without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using a shell command ('start syswin32.exe'). This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, where arbitrary code is fetched and executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system. The use of a non-standard, suspicious domain, lack of validation or integrity checks on the downloaded executable, silent exception handling, and execution of an external binary during install time are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is well-known to be associated exclusively with malware and is a critical risk for system compromise."
