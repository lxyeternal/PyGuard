      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate Python package. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package installation script. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution without user consent or interaction. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and abuse of the package installation process."
