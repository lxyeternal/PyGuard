      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command in setup.py, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. During installation, it collects system information including hostname, current working directory, and username without user consent. It then sends this sensitive environment data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io), which is not related to the package's stated purpose. This behavior is consistent with system fingerprinting and data exfiltration commonly seen in malware. The network communication is triggered automatically during package installation, without any user interaction or legitimate application logic justifying it. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard URL for data exfiltration in an install hook strongly indicates malicious intent and a supply chain attack vector."
