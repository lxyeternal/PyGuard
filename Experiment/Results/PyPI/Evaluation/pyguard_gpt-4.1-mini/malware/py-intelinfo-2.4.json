      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup or import is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for downloading or executing further payloads without user consent. Additionally, the author and email fields reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which may be associated with malicious actors. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, encoded PowerShell payload, execution during package setup, and suppression of exceptions, all strongly indicative of malicious intent."
