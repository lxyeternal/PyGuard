      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and dynamic execution via exec(). The code decodes a large base64-encoded string and immediately executes it, which is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior aimed at hiding the true intent of the code. Such obfuscation is commonly used to evade static analysis and detection. The decoded payload is not visible directly, but the pattern of base64 decoding followed by exec() strongly indicates arbitrary code execution. This technique is frequently used in malware to download, decrypt, or execute further malicious payloads without user consent or interaction. Given the extensive obfuscation, lack of transparency, and use of dynamic code execution, this code matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious Python code, including obfuscated payload execution, evasion of static analysis, and potential for remote code execution or data exfiltration."
