      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting staging or evasion behavior. This execution happens silently without user consent or notification, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package purpose. The rest of the setup call is benign-looking but likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated hidden PowerShell execution, execution during package setup, conditional execution based on environment, and lack of error handling, all pointing to malicious intent."
