      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and unrelated to any known legitimate package. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the setup.py code appears benign but is overshadowed by this stealthy, unauthorized execution of a hidden PowerShell payload. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, obfuscated payload, execution during package installation, and lack of user interaction or notification, all strongly indicative of malicious intent."
