      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This means arbitrary code is executed at install time without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The payload is encrypted and obfuscated, hiding its true intent, and executed dynamically during package installation. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during setup install phase strongly indicates malicious behavior. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, use of cryptography to hide payload, and execution of network-fetched or decrypted code without validation or user notification. Therefore, this code is malicious."
