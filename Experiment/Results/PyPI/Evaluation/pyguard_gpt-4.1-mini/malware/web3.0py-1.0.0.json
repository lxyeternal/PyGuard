      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing arbitrary, obfuscated code at install time without user consent, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of encrypted payloads to hide the true code, execution during package installation (a supply chain attack vector), and conditional execution only on Windows further support this conclusion. The package metadata and descriptions are nonsensical and obfuscated, which is typical for malicious packages attempting to evade detection. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including arbitrary code execution from an encrypted payload during installation, use of network-related modules (requests) likely for further malicious activity, and obfuscation."
