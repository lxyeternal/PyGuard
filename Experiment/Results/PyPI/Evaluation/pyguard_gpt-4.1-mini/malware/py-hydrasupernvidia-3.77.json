      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' and only runs the payload if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution to avoid repeated infection or detection. The URL embedded in the encoded command points to a suspicious domain 'cdn.discordapp.com' with a path that looks like it downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe', which is likely a malicious payload. This behavior is triggered during the package setup process, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during installation without user consent. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command, combined with the hidden window style, is a strong indicator of stealthy, unauthorized code execution. The rest of the setup() call appears benign but is used as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, suspicious hardcoded URLs, and execution triggered during package installation."
