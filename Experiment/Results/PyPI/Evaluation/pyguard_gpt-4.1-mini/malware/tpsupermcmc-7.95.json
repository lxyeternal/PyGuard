      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) that appears to download and execute an executable file silently. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. This execution happens immediately upon import or setup, without any user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script. The use of obfuscated, encoded commands, hidden execution, and downloading/executing remote payloads are classic hallmarks of malware, including supply chain attacks. The author and email fields appear to be fake or suspicious, and the domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) is non-standard and suspicious. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a potentially malicious executable during package installation or import, which is a critical security risk."
