      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It conditionally checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' and if absent, executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious and non-standard URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749497547150594048/Esquele.exe). This pattern of hidden execution, encoded PowerShell commands, and downloading/executing a remote executable is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy payload delivery and execution without user consent. Additionally, the code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malicious code to avoid detection. The presence of this behavior embedded in a setup script further indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation. All these factors combined confirm that the code is malicious."
