      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware (stealer). Key malicious actions include: 1) Exfiltration of system and user information (e.g., computer name, Windows key, IP, geolocation) to a suspicious external URL (https://kekwltd.ru/relay) via HTTP POST requests without user consent. 2) Stealing sensitive data such as browser passwords, cookies, credit card data, Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Minecraft and Roblox files by accessing local browser and application data directories, decrypting protected data using Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData), and saving this data locally. 3) Clipboard hijacking to replace cryptocurrency wallet addresses with attacker-controlled addresses, enabling theft of cryptocurrency funds. 4) Persistence mechanisms by copying itself to the Windows startup folder to run on system boot. 5) Killing processes related to Discord and debugging tools to evade detection and interfere with security software. 6) Use of obfuscated function and variable names, random file name generation, and suppression of exceptions to evade analysis. 7) Packaging and zipping stolen data, then uploading it to attacker-controlled endpoints. 8) Use of multiple network libraries (requests, httpx) to communicate with hardcoded suspicious domains and webhooks. 9) No user interaction or consent is requested before performing these actions. 10) The code targets Windows-specific paths and APIs, indicating targeted attack. These behaviors align with known malware patterns for credential theft, data exfiltration, and cryptocurrency theft. The presence of hardcoded attacker URLs, extensive data harvesting, persistence, and stealth techniques confirm the code is malicious."
