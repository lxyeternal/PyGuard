      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file named 'node' from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/misbebra-lol/actions-test/main/node) without any user interaction or validation, writes it to the /tmp directory, sets executable permissions, and immediately executes it with a command line argument '--nicehash'. Additionally, it writes a configuration file pointing to a hardcoded IP address (144.76.245.112:22221) with mining-related settings. This sequence of downloading and executing a binary from an untrusted source, combined with the use of a hardcoded IP address and execution during package setup, is a classic pattern of malicious behavior often associated with cryptomining malware or unauthorized payload execution. The code runs this payload silently during the package installation process without user consent or notification, which is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism."
