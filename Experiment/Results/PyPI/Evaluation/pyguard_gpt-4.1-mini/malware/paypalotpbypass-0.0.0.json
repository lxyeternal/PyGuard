      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding, including hex-encoded strings, base64 decoding, and zlib decompression, followed by dynamic evaluation (eval) of the decoded content. This pattern is a strong and well-known indicator of malicious intent, as it allows the execution of arbitrary code hidden from static analysis. The code imports modules dynamically and uses eval on decompressed data, which is a hallmark of malware delivery and execution. Additionally, the code constructs and executes shell commands in an obfuscated manner, and the presence of large encoded payloads suggests remote payload retrieval or execution of hidden malicious functionality. The absence of any legitimate application logic, combined with the obfuscation and dynamic code execution, strongly indicates that this code is designed to evade detection and perform unauthorized or harmful actions on the host system."
