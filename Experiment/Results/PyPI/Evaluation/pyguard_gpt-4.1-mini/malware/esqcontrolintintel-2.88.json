      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which when decoded reveals a command to invoke a web request to a suspicious domain 'dl.dropbox.com' with a query parameter 'Esquele.exe?dl=0', and then output the result to a file named '~\\WindowsCache.exe' and execute it. This pattern is a classic remote payload retrieval and execution, typical of malware infection chains. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The subprocess.Popen call uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide the process window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, the setup() call is present but wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, which may be an attempt to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. The author and email fields reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which do not correspond to any known legitimate package and may be associated with threat actors. Overall, the code abuses the package installation process to execute a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command that downloads and runs an executable from a suspicious URL without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery."
