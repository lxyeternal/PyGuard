      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious intent within a seemingly normal package installation script. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent or awareness. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package setup, and use of suspicious domains and emails."
