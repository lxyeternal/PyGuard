      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the package name 'esqgrandnvidialib' appear to be typosquatting or misleading. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during the setup script execution is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. These factors collectively indicate that the code is malicious and designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during package installation."
