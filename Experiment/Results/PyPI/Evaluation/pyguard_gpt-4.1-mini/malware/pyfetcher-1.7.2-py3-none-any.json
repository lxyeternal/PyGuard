      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://194.163.191.205:6963/builds/Netflix_Checker.exe) directly into the user's Documents directory without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using os.startfile. This pattern—unsolicited download and execution of a binary from a hardcoded external IP—is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. There is no validation, user notification, or legitimate application logic surrounding the network activity. The use of a hardcoded IP address rather than a domain name associated with a trusted service, combined with writing an executable to a user directory and launching it immediately, strongly indicates malicious intent."
