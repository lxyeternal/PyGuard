      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it embeds encrypted payload execution within the installation process of a Python package, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Specifically, the custom install command subclass GruppeInstall overrides the run() method to execute code only on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). It imports 'requests' and 'fernet' dynamically and decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), which allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation without user consent or interaction. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators: execution of obfuscated and encrypted code at install time, use of dynamic imports and exec on decrypted data, and embedding malicious payloads in setup.py install hooks. The package name and metadata are suspicious and obfuscated, further indicating malicious intent. The use of requests and cryptography libraries in this context strongly suggests the payload may perform network communication or further malicious actions. Overall, this is a classic example of a malicious Python package designed to execute hidden code during installation, posing a high security risk."
