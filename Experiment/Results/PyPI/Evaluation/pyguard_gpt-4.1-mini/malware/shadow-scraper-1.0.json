      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious Discord token stealer and credential harvester. It collects Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords, and other sensitive information from various browsers and Discord clients on the victim's machine. It decrypts encrypted tokens and passwords using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption, then validates and collects detailed user information via Discord API calls. The stolen data, including tokens, billing info, friend lists, gift codes, and other personal details, is exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code also attempts to gather Steam and Roblox tokens and user info, uploads files and zipped data to anonymous file hosting services, and sends links to the attacker. It uses threading to run multiple data collection routines concurrently. The script runs automatically without user consent and is embedded in a setuptools setup script, which can trigger execution during package installation. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, extensive credential theft, decryption of protected data, and exfiltration to external servers are definitive indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
