      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting staging or evasion logic. This execution happens silently without user consent or notification, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The presence of a suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further supports malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, which can hide failures and is typical in malicious scripts. Overall, the code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during package installation, a hallmark of malware."
