      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens during the setup script, which means it triggers on package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is used as a cover for the malicious payload execution. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command in a setup script is a strong indicator of malware aiming for remote code execution, persistence, or further payload delivery. Therefore, this code is malicious."
