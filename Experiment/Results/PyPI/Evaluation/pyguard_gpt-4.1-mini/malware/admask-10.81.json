      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist before launching this hidden PowerShell process, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or sandboxed execution. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user consent or interaction, and is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution alongside it strongly indicates malicious intent. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup is a hallmark of malware attempting to execute arbitrary code stealthily."
