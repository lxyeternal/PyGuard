      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and compression (base64, zlib) combined with dynamic evaluation (eval) of reconstructed code strings. It decompresses and decodes a base64-encoded payload and then executes it dynamically, which is a classic hallmark of malicious code designed to evade static analysis and hide its true intent. The code uses obfuscated variable names and lambda functions to further conceal its behavior. The presence of eval on dynamically reconstructed data, combined with zlib decompression and base64 decoding, strongly indicates arbitrary code execution from an obfuscated payload. This pattern is a critical risk indicator of malware, as it allows attackers to execute hidden payloads that can perform unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or system compromise. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the code is designed to conceal its purpose, which aligns with typical malicious behavior."
