      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package repository or known software. The use of subprocess to run hidden PowerShell commands with encoded payloads during the setup process (package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. The absence of error handling around the subprocess call and the silent exception suppression further indicate an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during package installation, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
