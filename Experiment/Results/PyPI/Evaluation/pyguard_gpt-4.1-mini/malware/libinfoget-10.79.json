      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a hallmark of malware, often used to download or execute further malicious payloads without user consent or visibility. Additionally, the setup() call masquerades as a legitimate package installation script but is used here as a cover for the malicious payload execution. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any known legitimate package. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, conditional execution based on file existence, and misuse of package setup scripts for malicious purposes."
