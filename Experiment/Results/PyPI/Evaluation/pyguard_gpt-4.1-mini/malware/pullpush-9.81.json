      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated PowerShell payloads stealthily. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating a conditional execution likely for persistence or payload deployment. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command, the suppression of exceptions, and the hidden window style all strongly indicate stealthy, unauthorized code execution. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution during package installation, stealth execution, and lack of user notification or validation."
