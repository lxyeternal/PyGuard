      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing obfuscated and encrypted code at install time without user consent or interaction, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of encrypted payloads to hide the true code, execution during package installation, and dynamic imports of network libraries (requests) for potential network activity are all typical characteristics of malware and supply chain attacks. The obfuscated class name and nonsensical package metadata further support the conclusion that this package is designed to execute hidden malicious code during installation."
