      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then launches this hidden PowerShell process without user consent or interaction. This behavior is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command, combined with the suppression of all exceptions (try-except pass), further indicates an attempt to evade detection and silently execute potentially malicious payloads. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution makes the entire script malicious."
