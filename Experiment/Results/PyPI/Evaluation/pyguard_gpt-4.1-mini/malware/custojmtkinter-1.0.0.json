      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools' install command to override the run() method, which executes arbitrary code during package installation without user consent. The run() method conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and ciphertext. This decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. The obfuscation of class names and the use of encrypted payloads to hide the true intent further confirm malicious intent. The code triggers this behavior only on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), which is a common tactic to evade detection on other platforms. The setup script also declares dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this malicious payload execution. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment."
