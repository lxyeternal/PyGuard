      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) which appears to be a remote executable download, suggesting the code tries to download and execute a potentially malicious payload without user consent. The check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or persistence tactics. This execution occurs during the package setup process, which is a common supply chain attack vector to run malicious code during installation. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') along with the suspicious URL and obfuscated execution further support the malicious intent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a remote payload during package installation, a hallmark of malicious behavior."
