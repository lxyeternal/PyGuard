      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user consent or interaction, and the code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before execution, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The malicious payload is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, abusing the package installation process to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This pattern is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload. The use of subprocess with hidden window style and encoded PowerShell commands, combined with the lack of error handling and silent exception suppression, further confirms the malicious intent."
