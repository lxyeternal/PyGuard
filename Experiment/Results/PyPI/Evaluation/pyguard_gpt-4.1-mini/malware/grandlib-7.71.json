      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only then executes the hidden PowerShell command, which is a common evasion technique. This execution happens during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector allowing arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. The combination of hidden process execution, encoded PowerShell payload, execution triggered during installation, and obfuscation strongly indicates malicious intent."
