      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) that is unrelated to the stated purpose of the package and is likely used to download or execute a malicious payload. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens silently within a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Additionally, the malicious code is embedded within a setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute malicious payloads during package installation without user consent. The combination of obfuscated encoded commands, hidden execution, suspicious external URL, and embedding in the installation process strongly confirms malicious intent."
