      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, indicating an attempt to evade static analysis and detection. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) to download or execute further code, which is unrelated to the stated purpose of the package and is a typical sign of malware. Additionally, this execution occurs during the setup process of a Python package, which is a known supply chain attack vector to execute arbitrary code on installation. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags to hide the window further confirms the intent to conceal malicious activity. Overall, these behaviors align with multiple critical risk patterns for malware, including obfuscated remote code execution, stealth execution, and abuse of package installation for payload delivery."
