      "malicious_behavior": "The code enumerates all files in the current directory and sends each file as a document to a hardcoded Telegram chat via a bot token without any user interaction or consent. It uses a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID to exfiltrate potentially sensitive files. The code performs network communication to an external endpoint (Telegram API) to upload files, which is a classic data exfiltration behavior. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this activity. The use of hardcoded credentials and automated file upload to an external service strongly indicates malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing malware. Additionally, the code attempts to install standard libraries via pip in an unusual way and clears the screen, which is suspicious. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate files from the victim's environment to an attacker-controlled Telegram channel, which is a clear malicious behavior."
