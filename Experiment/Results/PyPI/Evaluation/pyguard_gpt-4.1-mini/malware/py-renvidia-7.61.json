      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade detection and static analysis. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution window. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before running the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of a suspicious author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) and a suspicious domain comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports malicious intent. The payload likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further malicious code from a hardcoded URL embedded in the encoded command. The execution occurs during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector to execute code without user consent. All these factors combined indicate that this code is designed to stealthily execute malicious PowerShell commands during installation, making it highly malicious."
