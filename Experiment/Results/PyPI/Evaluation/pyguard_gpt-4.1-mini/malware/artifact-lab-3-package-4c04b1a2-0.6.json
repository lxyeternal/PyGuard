      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function 'notmalfunc' that collects all environment variables from the host system and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL hosted on an ngrok domain (https://5cecdbdb0328.ngrok.app/collect). This function is invoked automatically as a side effect of the package installation or development setup by subclassing setuptools' install and develop commands and overriding their run methods to call 'notmalfunc'. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: it performs unsolicited collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data without user consent, uses a suspicious hardcoded external URL (ngrok domain), and triggers this data exfiltration automatically during package installation or development setup, which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this network activity. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware embedded in a Python package installation process."
