      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to hide the actual command content. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a conditional execution pattern often used to avoid repeated infection or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup or installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. The silent exception handling (except: pass) suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is highly indicative of malware designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands on Windows systems during package installation or execution."
