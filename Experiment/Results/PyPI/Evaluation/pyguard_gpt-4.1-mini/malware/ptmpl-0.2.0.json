      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (PostInstallCommand) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it runs a subprocess that executes a Python command: 'import ptmpl.post_install; ptmpl.post_install.download_and_run_script()'. This means that immediately after installation, arbitrary code from the ptmpl.post_install module is executed without user interaction or consent. This pattern is a known high-risk and critical-risk indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The code does not show the content of ptmpl.post_install.download_and_run_script(), but the invocation during install strongly suggests it downloads and runs additional code or payloads. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators: execution of code during install, use of subprocess to run Python code, and lack of user notification or validation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a shell script from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://fhost.devxops.eu.org/devops/cicd/scripts/dh-storage-v1.1.sh) directly into the user's home directory without any user interaction or consent. It then makes the script executable and runs it with specific parameters. Additionally, it runs system commands to update apt and install tmux without user confirmation. This pattern of downloading and executing remote code during package installation or post-installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The lack of validation, user notification, or integrity checks on the downloaded script, combined with execution of shell commands and remote payload retrieval, indicates a high risk of arbitrary code execution and potential system compromise."
