      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and unrelated to the declared package purpose. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution occurs at install time (within the setup script), which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, with no user interaction or legitimate justification, is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
