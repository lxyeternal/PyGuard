      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the stated package purpose. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. The subprocess call runs without user consent or interaction, in a hidden window, and executes an encoded command, which is a hallmark of malware delivery and execution. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially supply chain attacks or malicious PyPI packages that execute code during installation without user awareness."
