      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or sandboxed execution. This execution happens at import or setup time without user consent or interaction, which is a typical supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, which is used as a cover to hide the malicious payload execution during installation. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command, the suppression of all exceptions, and the lack of any legitimate business logic around this execution further confirm malicious intent."
