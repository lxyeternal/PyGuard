      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is hardcoded and decrypted with a hardcoded key, then executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag for arbitrary code execution. This execution happens silently during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, encrypted payload, and execution during install time strongly indicates an attempt to hide malicious code execution. The package setup metadata is also obfuscated and suspicious. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, use of cryptography to hide payload, and execution of decrypted code without validation or user notification. Therefore, this code is malicious."
