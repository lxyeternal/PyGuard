      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions silently, further indicating malicious intent. The check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests conditional execution to evade analysis or ensure persistence. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to facilitate installation, but the embedded hidden PowerShell execution is a strong indicator of malware, consistent with supply chain attacks or post-install payload delivery. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, obfuscated payloads, execution during package installation, and lack of user consent."
