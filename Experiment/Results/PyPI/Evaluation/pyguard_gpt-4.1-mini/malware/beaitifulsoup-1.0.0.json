      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is embedded in the package installation process to execute hidden payloads. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during installation strongly indicates intent to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions. The package name 'BeaitifulSoup' is a typo-squatting attempt mimicking the popular 'BeautifulSoup' package, which is a common tactic in malicious PyPI packages. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) only used inside the install hook further supports the malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful code on Windows systems during package installation, which is a high-risk malicious behavior."
