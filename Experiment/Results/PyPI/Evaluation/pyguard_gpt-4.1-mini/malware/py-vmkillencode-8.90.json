      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which when decoded reveals a command to invoke a web request to a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden window. This behavior is consistent with remote payload retrieval and execution, a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The malicious payload execution is embedded in the setup script, which means it triggers during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The presence of a suspicious author email and domain (EsqueleSquad, tahgoficial@proton.me, www.esquelesquad.rip) adds to the suspicion. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a potentially harmful executable from an external source during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
