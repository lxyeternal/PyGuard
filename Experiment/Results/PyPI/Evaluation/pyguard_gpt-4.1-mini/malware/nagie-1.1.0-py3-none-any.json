      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://nagogy-cdn.dreamyoak.repl.co/cdn/KGK8zSTh.exe') without any user interaction, validation, or consent. It writes the downloaded content directly to disk as 'windows.exe' and immediately executes it using os.system with the 'start' command, which launches the executable on Windows. This pattern of fetching a binary payload from an untrusted remote source and executing it without verification or user notification is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The domain used is non-standard and not associated with legitimate software distribution. There is no legitimate application logic or error handling surrounding these operations, increasing suspicion. According to the provided knowledge points, this sequence is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables remote code execution from an untrusted source, a primary vector for system compromise, persistence, or further payload delivery."
