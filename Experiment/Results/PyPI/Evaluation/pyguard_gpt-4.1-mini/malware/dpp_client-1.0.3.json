      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes shell commands ('pwd', 'whoami', 'hostname') to collect sensitive system information such as the current working directory, the username, and the hostname. It then encodes this information as URL parameters and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain 'http://pt.traktrain.com/RCE_PYTHON'. This behavior is consistent with system fingerprinting and data exfiltration, which are common in malware. Furthermore, this data collection and exfiltration occur without any user interaction or consent and are embedded directly in the package setup script, which means this code will run during package installation. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including environment discovery, unsolicited data exfiltration to a suspicious external server, and execution of shell commands during installation without legitimate purpose. The rest of the code is a standard setuptools setup call, which likely serves as a cover for the malicious data exfiltration. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
