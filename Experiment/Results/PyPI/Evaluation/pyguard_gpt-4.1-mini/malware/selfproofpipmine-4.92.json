      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and unrelated to legitimate package sources. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during the setup script execution is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The rest of the setup.py code appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package installation."
