      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It embeds a reverse shell payload inside the 'Code' string, which is written to a file named 'remote-access.py' during the package installation process (via a custom setuptools install command subclass). This payload attempts to connect back to a hardcoded external IP address (82.157.252.61) on port 1234 without any user interaction or consent. Upon successful connection, it spawns an interactive shell (cmd.exe on Windows or /bin/bash on Linux) with input/output redirected over the socket, effectively granting remote control of the victim machine to the attacker. The installation script writes this payload to a user directory (home or Documents) and immediately executes it in a subprocess, ensuring the reverse shell runs stealthily in the background. This pattern is a classic remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor, leveraging the package installation process as a supply chain attack vector to gain unauthorized remote access. The use of hardcoded IP, socket duplication to standard streams, spawning shell processes, and execution during install without user consent are all strong indicators of malicious intent."
