      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a conditional execution pattern often used by malware to avoid repeated execution or detection. This execution happens at import time or during setup, without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which serves as a cover for the malicious payload. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command in a setup script is a critical risk indicator of malware, consistent with known malicious patterns for remote code execution, stealth, and persistence."
