      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which when decoded reveals a PowerShell invocation of 'Invoke-WebRequest' to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and then runs it with output redirected to a hidden window. This behavior is consistent with malware that downloads and executes a remote payload without user consent or interaction, using obfuscation to evade detection. The presence of this code in a setup script further indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation. The domain and author information (EsqueleSquad, tahgoficial@proton.me) and the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' also suggest malicious intent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a potentially malicious executable on Windows systems during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
