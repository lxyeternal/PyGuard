      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that invokes a web request to a suspicious GitHub raw URL (https://github.com/T4Hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and executes it silently without user consent or interaction. This behavior is triggered conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a staging or persistence mechanism. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The domain and URL used are unrelated to the package's stated purpose and author, and the entire operation is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses errors, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent, specifically remote payload retrieval and execution without user consent."
