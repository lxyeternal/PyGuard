      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup.py installation script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks enabling code execution during package installation without user consent. The read_version() function collects detailed system information including the hostname, platform details, current working directory, and network interface information (via ifconfig output). This data is concatenated and base64-encoded, then sent via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://1.15.77.2/v/). The use of a hardcoded IP rather than a domain, combined with the exfiltration of potentially sensitive system fingerprinting data without user interaction or notification, is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. Additionally, the subprocess.Popen call executes a file named 'version' located alongside the package, which may be used to run arbitrary code during installation. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network communication or subprocess execution in the setup script. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk patterns such as environment fingerprinting, data exfiltration via encoded payloads, execution of code during package installation, and use of hardcoded suspicious endpoints. Therefore, this code is malicious."
