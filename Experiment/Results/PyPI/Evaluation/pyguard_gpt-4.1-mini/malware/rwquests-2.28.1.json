      "malicious_behavior": "The code fetches a list of executable filenames from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt) without any user interaction or consent. It then downloads these executables from the same IP and writes them directly to disk. After saving, it sets executable permissions on Unix-like systems and immediately executes these downloaded files in the background using shell commands (os.system). This pattern of unsolicited downloading and execution of binaries from a hardcoded external IP address, without validation, user notification, or error handling, is a classic hallmark of malware. The code also hooks into all HTTP method functions (get, post, put, patch, delete, head, options, request) to run this payload execution function before performing any network request, indicating an attempt to hide malicious behavior behind seemingly normal network operations. The absence of any legitimate application logic, obfuscation, or user consent, combined with direct execution of remote code, strongly indicates malicious intent."
