      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using character code escapes, base64 decoding, and dynamic evaluation (eval) of decoded and decompressed data. It uses multiple layers of obfuscation including eval on strings constructed from integer-to-character conversions, base64 decoding, and zlib decompression. The code dynamically imports modules and executes decoded payloads without any user interaction or consent. Such patterns are classic indicators of malicious intent, as they allow attackers to hide and execute arbitrary code, evade static analysis, and potentially download or run further malicious payloads. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest this code is designed to perform unauthorized or harmful actions, consistent with malware behavior."
