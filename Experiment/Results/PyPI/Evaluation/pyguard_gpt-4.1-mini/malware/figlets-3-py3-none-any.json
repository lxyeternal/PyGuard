      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It silently checks for the existence of specific directories and files related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet in the user's roaming appdata and desktop/downloads/documents folders. If found, it collects multiple sensitive wallet-related files (e.g., passphrase.json, seed.seco, twofactor-secret.seco) and archives them into a zip file in the user's roaming directory. It then gathers the victim's public IP address and country code via external HTTP requests to ip-api.com, constructs a message including this information, and sends both the message and the zipped wallet files to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID via Telegram's bot API. The code suppresses exceptions to avoid detection and deletes the zip file after exfiltration, indicating anti-forensics behavior. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying these actions. The use of hardcoded Telegram bot credentials and direct exfiltration of sensitive wallet files to an external service is a strong indicator of credential theft and data exfiltration malware."

It then attempts to collect sensitive wallet-related files (e.g., passphrase.json, seed.seco, twofactor-secret.seco) and archives them into a zip file named after the user. The script gathers the victim's public IP address and country code via external HTTP requests, constructs a message including this information, and exfiltrates both the message and the zipped wallet files to a hardcoded Telegram bot API endpoint using a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. The entire process occurs without any user interaction or consent, suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, and deletes the zip file after sending to cover tracks. The use of hardcoded Telegram bot credentials, targeting of sensitive wallet files, environment variable usage to locate user directories, and immediate network exfiltration of sensitive data to an external service are strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior aligns with typical cryptocurrency wallet credential theft malware designed to steal wallet secrets and send them to an attacker-controlled Telegram channel."
