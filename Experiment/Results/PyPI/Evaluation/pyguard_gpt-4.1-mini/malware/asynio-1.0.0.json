      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute hidden malicious code during installation. The run() method checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. This execution happens silently during package installation without user consent or interaction, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution in the install hook strongly indicates an attempt to evade detection and deliver a malicious payload. The package metadata is also suspicious, with meaningless strings for name, author, and description, further supporting malicious intent. Overall, this code is a high-risk supply chain attack that executes arbitrary, encrypted code on Windows systems during package installation."
