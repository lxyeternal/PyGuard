      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) which appears to be a remote payload download or execution source. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens during the setup script, meaning it triggers on package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and the commented URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) further suggest malicious intent. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command, combined with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, is a strong indicator of stealthy, unauthorized code execution. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated remote payload during package installation, which is a hallmark of malware."
