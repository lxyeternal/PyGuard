      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command is executed without user consent or interaction and is triggered conditionally if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating possible staging or evasion behavior. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command in a setup script is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands on Windows systems during package setup, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
