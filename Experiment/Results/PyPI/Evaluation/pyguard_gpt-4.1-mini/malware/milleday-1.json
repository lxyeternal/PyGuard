      "malicious_behavior": "The code is malicious and exhibits clear signs of credential theft and data exfiltration. It targets sensitive files related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet stored in the user's roaming appdata directory and common user folders (Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It collects these files, compresses them into a ZIP archive, and sends the archive along with system information (username, IP address, country code) to a hardcoded Telegram bot via its API token and chat ID. The code operates without any user interaction or consent, silently suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, and deletes the ZIP archive after exfiltration to cover tracks. The use of hardcoded Telegram bot credentials and chat ID for data exfiltration, combined with targeting wallet files, is a classic hallmark of a wallet stealer malware. The network communication to an external service for sending stolen data, the targeting of sensitive user directories, and the absence of legitimate application logic confirm the malicious intent."
