      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, it collects environment information such as the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This behavior occurs automatically during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard URL unrelated to the package's stated purpose, combined with environment fingerprinting and immediate data exfiltration during install time, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including supply chain attack vectors and information exfiltration. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network call, no error handling or user notification, and the code is embedded in the setup.py install hook, which is a known technique for executing malicious code during package installation. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
