      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python script to a temporary file that contains a command to fetch and execute code from a hardcoded, external URL (https://paste.fo/raw/afb1dbd35339) without any user interaction or validation. It then attempts to execute this temporary script using a system shell command that launches a Python interpreter variant (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe' to likely suppress the console window) to run the downloaded code. This pattern of dynamically downloading and executing remote code without user consent or validation is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The use of a hardcoded suspicious URL, writing executable code to a temp file, and immediate execution via shell commands with suppressed windows strongly indicates a remote code execution attack vector, typical of malware or supply chain attacks. The absence of error handling or user notification further supports the malicious intent."
