      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet with a hardcoded key. This decrypted payload is obfuscated and executed without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector enabling arbitrary code execution at install time. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows the attacker to hide the true payload and execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system stealthily. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description further support the intent to evade detection. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code execution during package installation, use of cryptographic decryption with hardcoded keys, and execution of decrypted payloads via exec(). Therefore, this code is malicious."
