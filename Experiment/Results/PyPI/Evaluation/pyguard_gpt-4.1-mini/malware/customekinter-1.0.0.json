      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). This means arbitrary code is executed at install time without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated, encrypted payloads executed during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The package name and metadata are nonsensical and likely intended to disguise the malicious payload. The code triggers remote code execution during installation, which can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution in setup scripts, use of cryptography to hide payloads, and execution of code without user awareness."
