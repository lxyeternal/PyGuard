      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens during the package setup script, which is a known supply chain attack vector allowing arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is overshadowed by the hidden execution of the encoded PowerShell command. These factors combined—hidden process execution, encoded payload, execution during installation, and conditional directory check—are strong indicators of malicious intent."
