      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) which appears to be downloading or executing an external executable without user consent or interaction. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. Additionally, this execution is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing arbitrary code execution during package installation. The author and email fields reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which do not correspond to any known legitimate package or author, further raising suspicion. The combination of obfuscated, hidden execution, external payload retrieval, and execution during installation without user consent strongly indicates malicious intent."
