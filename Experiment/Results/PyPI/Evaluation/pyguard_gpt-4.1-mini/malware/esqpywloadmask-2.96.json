      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) which appears to be a remote payload download or execution attempt. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector to run malicious code upon installation without user consent. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, encoded PowerShell commands, execution during package installation, and use of suspicious external URLs, confirming the code is malicious."
