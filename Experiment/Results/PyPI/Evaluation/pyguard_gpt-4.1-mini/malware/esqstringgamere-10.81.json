      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded command is a Base64 string that, when decoded, likely contains a PowerShell script that downloads or executes further payloads from a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. This execution happens silently without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script for a Python package, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command string is suspicious and likely to evade simple detection. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is used as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell payload during package installation or execution, which is a hallmark of malware."
