      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads or executes content from a suspicious URL (cdndiscardapp.com) unrelated to the stated package purpose. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory 'tahg' before executing the payload, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or ensure environment suitability. This execution occurs during the package setup process, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing arbitrary code execution without user consent. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags to hide the window further confirms stealthy execution intent. The package metadata falsely claims to be a benign library, masking the malicious payload. All these factors combined—hidden execution, obfuscated payload, suspicious external URL, execution during installation, and suppression of exceptions—confirm that this code is malicious."
