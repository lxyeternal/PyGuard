      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions, indicating an attempt to hide malicious activity. The check for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. The presence of this code in a setup script (commonly executed during package installation) indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes automatically upon package installation. The author and email fields appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate software. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation without user consent."
