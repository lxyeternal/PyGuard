      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell, which is a classic malicious behavior. It creates a network socket that connects to a hardcoded external host and port (4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:10308), then duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error, effectively redirecting the shell's I/O to the remote server. It then executes a bash shell command that opens an interactive shell over the TCP connection. This allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the victim machine without user consent or interaction. The use of hardcoded external domain and port, socket redirection via os.dup2, and spawning an interactive shell subprocess are all strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor behavior."
