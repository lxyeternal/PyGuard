      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to retrieve an access token from the Google Compute Engine metadata service at the internal IP 169.254.169.254, which is a sensitive token granting access to the instance's service account. It then sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of credential theft and data exfiltration. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard external domain for sending sensitive tokens, combined with the lack of legitimate application logic or user notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches known indicators of malware that exfiltrate sensitive credentials from cloud environments."
