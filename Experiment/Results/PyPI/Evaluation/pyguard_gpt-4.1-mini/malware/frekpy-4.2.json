      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mkd3enun97s8zag/Oxzy.exe?dl=0) and writes it directly to the TEMP directory with the filename 'Python-3.9.exe'. It then immediately executes this file using os.system without any user interaction, validation, or notification. This pattern of fetching a binary payload from an external source and executing it silently is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The use of environment variables to determine the file path, suppression of all exceptions to avoid detection, and repeated invocation of this behavior in multiple static methods under innocuous class names further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent involved, and the behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including remote payload retrieval, local persistence attempt, and arbitrary code execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
