      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code at install time strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the package name 'BeautifulSoupe' is a likely typo-squatting attempt on the legitimate 'BeautifulSoup' package, which is a known tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The presence of network-related modules (requests) in the install hook suggests potential for further network communication or payload retrieval. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated payload execution during installation, use of cryptography to hide payload, and no legitimate application logic justifying such behavior."
