      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) that appears to download and execute an executable file named 'Esquele.exe' in a hidden manner without user consent or interaction. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector to run malicious code upon installation. The use of a suspicious author name and email (EsqueleSquad, tahgoficial@proton.me) and the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports malicious intent. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical to avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a potentially malicious executable on Windows systems during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
