      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed without user consent or interaction. The code first checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' and only runs the payload if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess to run hidden PowerShell with encoded commands during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and potential further payload delivery. The setup() call appears benign but is used as a cover to hide the malicious payload execution. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution triggered during package installation."
