      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists and only then runs the hidden PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade analysis or ensure persistence. This execution happens during the import or setup phase without user interaction or consent, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. The use of subprocess to run hidden PowerShell with encoded commands, combined with the conditional directory check and silent exception handling, strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at executing hidden payloads on Windows systems."
