      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup or installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a cover or delivery mechanism for the malicious payload. The silent exception handling (except: pass) suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated payload on Windows systems during package installation or execution, which is a hallmark of malware."
