      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to perform network communication during package installation without user consent or interaction. Specifically, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, encodes this data as a base64 JSON payload, and sends it via a crafted HTTPS GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain 'd4d.one'. This behavior is a classic example of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration embedded in a package installation script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The network communication is done silently with all exceptions suppressed, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission during installation. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard domain, base64 encoding of sensitive system information, and execution of this code as a side effect of package installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with known malware patterns."
