      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior due to the following reasons: It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known vector for executing arbitrary code during package installation (a supply chain attack pattern). Inside the overridden run() method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules only on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), which is suspicious and indicative of targeted behavior. It then uses a hardcoded Fernet symmetric encryption key and an encrypted payload (ciphertext) that is decrypted and immediately executed via exec(). This means arbitrary code execution occurs silently during installation without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload hides the true intent of the code, evading static analysis. The package name 'requekts' is a typo-squatting variant of the legitimate 'requests' package, a common tactic in malicious PyPI packages. The setup script specifies dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook. The long and meaningless DESCRIPTION and LONG_DESCRIPTION strings are likely to obfuscate or distract from the malicious payload. The code executes the decrypted payload only on Windows, indicating targeted malicious intent. This pattern of executing encrypted code during installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. Therefore, this code is malicious and poses a critical security risk."
