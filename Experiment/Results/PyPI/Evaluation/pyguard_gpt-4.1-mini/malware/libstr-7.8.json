      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist before launching this hidden PowerShell process, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens silently without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation. The use of subprocess to run hidden, encoded PowerShell commands during installation is a hallmark of malware aiming for stealthy code execution and potential further payload delivery or persistence."
