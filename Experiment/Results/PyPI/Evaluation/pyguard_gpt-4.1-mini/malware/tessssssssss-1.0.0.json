      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class (CustomInstall) that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to perform additional actions during package installation. After running the standard install process, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (a Burp Collaborator domain, commonly used for testing or malicious exfiltration). This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns: it executes code during package installation without user consent, collects potentially sensitive system information, and exfiltrates it to an attacker-controlled server. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard URL unrelated to the package's stated purpose, combined with the lack of user interaction or legitimate application logic, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern is a known supply chain attack vector and is consistent with malware that performs environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration during installation."
