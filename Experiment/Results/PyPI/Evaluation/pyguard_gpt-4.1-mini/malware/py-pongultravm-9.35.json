      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' hint at a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution occurs at import or setup time without user consent or interaction, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. All these factors combined strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated payload during package installation or import, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
