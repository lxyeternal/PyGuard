      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. This behavior is triggered during the package setup process, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution without user consent. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, combined with the silent exception handling (try-except pass), indicates an attempt to evade detection and run potentially malicious code. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears benign but is used here as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy, unauthorized code execution during package installation."
