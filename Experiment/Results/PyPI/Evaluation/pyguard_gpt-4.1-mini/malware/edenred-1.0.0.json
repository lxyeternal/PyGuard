      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, after running the standard install routine, it collects system information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (https://cdf5rwk2vtc0000c78d0ggz1hqeyyyyyb.oast.fun). This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns associated with malware, including: execution of network communication during package installation without user consent, exfiltration of system-specific information to a suspicious external endpoint, use of a hardcoded non-standard URL unrelated to the package's stated purpose, and embedding malicious behavior in the install hook of a Python package setup script. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data exfiltration. This pattern is a known supply chain attack vector and is strongly indicative of malicious intent."
