      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute hidden malicious code during installation. The run() method checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. This behavior occurs silently during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution in the install hook strongly indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this malicious purpose. The description and long_description fields contain meaningless random strings, further suggesting obfuscation and lack of legitimate functionality. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, encrypted malicious code during installation on Windows systems, which is a high-risk and critical indicator of malware."
