      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is embedded in the package installation process to execute hidden payloads. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during installation strongly indicates intent to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions. The package name 'tensogflow' is a typo-squatting variant of the legitimate 'tensorflow' package, which is a common tactic used by attackers to trick users into installing malicious packages. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) in the install hook further supports the likelihood of malicious network activity or payload delivery. Overall, this code matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution during package installation, obfuscation, encrypted payload execution, and use of a typo-squatted package name."
