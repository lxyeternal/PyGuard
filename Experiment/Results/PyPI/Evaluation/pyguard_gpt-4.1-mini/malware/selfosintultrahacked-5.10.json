      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The subprocess.Popen call is executed without user consent or interaction and suppresses exceptions, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The malicious payload is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute code during package installation. Overall, the combination of hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands, suppression of errors, conditional execution based on directory presence, and embedding in a setup script strongly indicates malicious intent."
