      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to hide the actual command content. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup or installation is a hallmark of malware, often used for remote code execution, payload delivery, or persistence. Additionally, the author and email fields reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which may be associated with suspicious or malicious actors. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, and execution triggered during package installation without user consent."
