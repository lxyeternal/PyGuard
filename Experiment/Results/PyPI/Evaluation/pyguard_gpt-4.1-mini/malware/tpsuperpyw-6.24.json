      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup or import is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, obfuscated payload, execution during package setup, and lack of user notification, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
