      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window, a hallmark of malware. This execution occurs during the setup script, meaning it runs automatically during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and conditional evasion checks, all consistent with malicious intent."
