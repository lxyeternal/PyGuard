      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute arbitrary code during installation without user consent. The run() method checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing obfuscated code at install time is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation (a known supply chain attack vector). The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution without transparency or user interaction further confirms the malicious nature. Additionally, the setup script declares dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests' which are used solely for this hidden payload execution. The presence of this behavior in the install hook of a setup.py script is a critical risk and consistent with malware delivery and execution techniques."
