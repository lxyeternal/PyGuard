      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user consent or interaction, and is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of this hidden, encoded, and silent execution of a PowerShell command strongly indicates malicious intent, likely to download or execute further payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the victim system."
