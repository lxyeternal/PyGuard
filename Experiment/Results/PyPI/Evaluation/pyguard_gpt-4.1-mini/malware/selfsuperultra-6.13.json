      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a conditional execution pattern often used by malware to avoid repeated execution or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest suspicious origins. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution occurs in the setup script, meaning it runs during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and conditional stealth checks, all consistent with malware behavior."
