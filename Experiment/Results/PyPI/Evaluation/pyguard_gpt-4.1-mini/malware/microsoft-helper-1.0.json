      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python snippet to a temporary file that imports urllib.request.urlopen to fetch and execute code directly from a hardcoded external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/rg8v8/raw) without any user interaction, validation, or consent. It then immediately executes this temporary file using a system call that launches a new Python interpreter process. This pattern—dynamic fetching and execution of remote code during package setup/install, writing and running temporary files, use of os.system to spawn processes, and absence of error handling or user notification—is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, often seen in supply chain attacks or malware delivery. The external URL is suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package repository, and the code executes arbitrary remote code at install time, which is a critical security risk. Therefore, this code is malicious."
