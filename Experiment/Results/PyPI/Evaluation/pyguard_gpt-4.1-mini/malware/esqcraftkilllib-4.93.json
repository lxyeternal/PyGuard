      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which when decoded reveals a PowerShell invocation of a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and executes it silently with output redirected to a hidden file (~\\/WindowsCache.exe). This pattern is strongly associated with malware, as it downloads and executes a remote executable without user consent or interaction, suppresses errors, and runs in a hidden window to evade detection. The presence of this behavior in a setup script further indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation. The rest of the setup code appears benign, but the subprocess call with encoded PowerShell command is a high-risk, critical malicious pattern."
