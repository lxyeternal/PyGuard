      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist before launching this hidden PowerShell process, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation, without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. Such behavior is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for downloading or executing further malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or performing unauthorized actions covertly. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which serves as a disguise or delivery mechanism for the malicious payload. Given these factors and the known risk indicators, this code is malicious."
