      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python snippet to a temporary file that performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious URL ('https://rentry.co/277t2/raw') and executes the downloaded content using exec(). This is done without any user interaction, validation, or consent. Immediately after writing the file, the code attempts to execute it via a shell command using os.system, launching a new Python interpreter process with the temporary file as an argument. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code dynamically, writing to a temp file, and spawning a new process to run it—is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, enabling arbitrary code execution from an untrusted external source. The use of a non-standard URL, lack of error handling, obfuscation via indirect imports and variable renaming, and silent exception suppression further reinforce the malicious intent. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is a critical risk indicator of malware, commonly used for remote payload retrieval and execution, often seen in supply chain attacks, backdoors, or trojans."
