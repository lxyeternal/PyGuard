      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) which appears to be a remote executable download. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens during the setup process of a Python package, which is a known supply chain attack vector to run malicious code during package installation without user consent. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') along with the commented URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' further suggest malicious intent or a hacking group. The subprocess call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, enhancing stealth. The entire pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, remote payload download, and execution during package installation, all of which are hallmark behaviors of malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
