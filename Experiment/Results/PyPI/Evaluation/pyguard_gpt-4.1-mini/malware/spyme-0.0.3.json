      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script that triggers execution during package installation (when sys.argv[1] == 'install'), which is a known supply chain attack vector. The spyMe() function downloads three executable files (listener, keylogger payload, and reverse shell) from a hardcoded local URL (http://127.0.0.1:5000/), writes them directly to the Windows Temp directory without any validation or user consent, and then executes one of them (the listener) in the background with hidden process flags. This pattern of downloading and executing untrusted executables during installation, without user interaction or notification, is a classic hallmark of malware. The use of hardcoded system paths, direct network fetches of executables, and immediate execution of these files strongly indicates remote payload retrieval and local persistence setup. The absence of error handling, logging, or any legitimate application logic further supports the malicious classification. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily deploy and run potentially harmful payloads on the victim's system as part of a command-and-control infrastructure."
