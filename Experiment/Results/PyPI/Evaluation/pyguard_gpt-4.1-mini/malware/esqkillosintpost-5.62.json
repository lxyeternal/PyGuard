      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution window. The code first checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before running this command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the package author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The use of an encoded PowerShell command embedded in a setup script (which runs during package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
