      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded command appears to invoke a web request to a suspicious GitHub raw URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden window, which is indicative of downloading and running a potentially malicious payload without user consent or interaction. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known supply chain attack vector to run malicious code during package installation. The use of a suspicious domain (github.com with a raw file path to an executable) combined with hidden execution and encoded PowerShell commands strongly indicates malicious intent."
