      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly obfuscated payload executed via exec on a dynamically constructed string derived from complex float and string manipulations. This obfuscation technique is a classic indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the actual code being executed, preventing easy static analysis. The payload is embedded directly in the setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of exec on such obfuscated data strongly suggests that the code executes hidden malicious actions without user consent or interaction. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the critical malicious behavior is triggered by the obfuscated exec call at the start. This pattern aligns with multiple high and critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated code execution in install scripts, lack of transparency, and evasion of static detection."
