      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which executes arbitrary code during package installation without user consent. Specifically, in the run() method, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. This behavior is embedded in the package setup process, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class names, hardcoded cryptographic keys, encrypted payloads, and execution during install time strongly indicates malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate application logic around this network or execution activity, and the encrypted payload likely contains further malicious code. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, and use of cryptography to hide payloads."
