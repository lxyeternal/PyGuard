      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or malicious actor. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during the setup script execution (which runs on package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, execution during package installation, and lack of error handling. Therefore, this code is malicious."
