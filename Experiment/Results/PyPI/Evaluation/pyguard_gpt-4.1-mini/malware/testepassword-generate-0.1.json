It includes execution of arbitrary code via exec() on decoded data, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code performs environment inspection, collects system and user information, and sends it to external, suspicious domains. It writes files to hidden or obscure directories, uses dynamic imports, and executes shell commands in a hidden or background manner. The presence of encoded PowerShell commands executed in hidden mode, network communication to non-standard or suspicious URLs, and execution triggered during package installation (setup.py) are all hallmark behaviors of malware or supply chain attacks. The code also suppresses exceptions and lacks any legitimate application logic or user interaction, further confirming its malicious nature."
