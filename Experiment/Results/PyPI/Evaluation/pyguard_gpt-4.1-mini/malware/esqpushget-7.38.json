      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of this execution in the setup script (commonly run during package installation) suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code runs automatically upon package installation without user consent. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) do not correspond to any known legitimate software and may be associated with malicious activity. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, with no user interaction or legitimate purpose, is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
