      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware (stealer). It collects extensive sensitive data from the victim's system, including browser passwords, cookies, credit card data, Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Minecraft files, system information (Windows key, hardware ID, IP geolocation), and screenshots. It decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption, indicating intent to extract protected credentials. The code exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded suspicious external URL (https://kekwltd.ru/relay/bluescreen) via HTTP POST requests, including Discord webhooks, which are commonly abused for stealthy data exfiltration. It also attempts to persist by copying itself to the Windows startup folder and can kill processes related to Discord and debugging tools to evade detection. The code includes clipboard hijacking functionality that replaces cryptocurrency wallet addresses in the clipboard with attacker-controlled addresses, a known theft technique. It performs environment and VM detection to avoid running in analysis environments. The code installs multiple Python packages dynamically without user consent, uses obfuscated function and variable names, and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. It creates temporary files with randomized names to store stolen data and zips collected files for exfiltration. All these behaviors—credential theft, token stealing, clipboard hijacking, persistence, anti-debugging, and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints—are hallmark traits of malicious stealer malware."
