      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command during the package setup process without user consent or interaction. Specifically, it checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then launches a PowerShell process with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated commands stealthily. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method used by malware to evade detection. This execution happens immediately upon running the setup script, indicating a supply chain attack vector or malicious payload delivery during installation. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. The rest of the setup code appears benign, but the presence of this hidden, encoded PowerShell execution triggered during installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior."
