      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) do not correspond to any known legitimate package or library. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command to execute hidden code is a classic malware behavior. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation without user consent, a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy or cover to appear as a legitimate package. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute hidden PowerShell commands during installation, which is a critical indicator of malicious intent."
