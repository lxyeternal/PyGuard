      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known vector for executing arbitrary code during package installation (a supply chain attack pattern). Inside the run() method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. This execution happens silently during installation without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during install strongly indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent and deliver a payload covertly. The package setup also specifies Windows as the target OS, and the malicious code only runs on Windows (os.name == 'nt'). These factors combined match multiple high-risk and critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, and use of cryptography to hide payloads."
