      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which means it executes during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The script creates a disguised folder named 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK' to hide its activities. It then downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL hosted on Discord's CDN (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), which is not a standard or trusted source for software distribution. The downloaded executable is saved with a suspicious name 'XMICNEI.exe' inside the hidden folder and immediately executed without any user consent or validation. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote binary silently is a classic malware behavior, enabling remote payload delivery and execution. The absence of error handling, user notification, or integrity checks further confirms the malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily fetch and run potentially harmful software on the victim's machine, making it highly malicious."

It then downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external Discord CDN URL without any user consent or validation. The downloaded file is saved as 'XMICNEI.exe' inside the hidden directory and immediately executed using os.startfile. This pattern of downloading and executing an external binary silently, without user interaction or integrity checks, is a classic malware behavior indicative of remote payload retrieval and execution. The use of a disguised folder name, hardcoded suspicious URL, lack of error handling, and immediate execution of the downloaded executable strongly indicate malicious intent."
