      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects Steam-related files (ssfn files and config directory) from the user's Program Files (x86) Steam folder without any user consent or interaction. It then compresses these files into a zip archive in the TEMP directory and immediately sends this archive via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration, targeting potentially sensitive Steam session files that could be used to hijack or impersonate the user's Steam account. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data transmission, absence of any legitimate application logic or user notification, and silent cleanup of the temporary zip file strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving credential or session token theft and exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code silently checks for the existence of a specific directory in the user's AppData Roaming folder (Exodus), which is typically a location for application data. It then copies this directory to a temporary location, compresses it into a zip archive, and uploads the archive via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for uploading potentially sensitive user data, combined with the absence of any legitimate application logic or user interaction, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to delete the temporary files afterward, which is a common anti-forensics technique to hide traces of data theft. These factors align with multiple high-risk and critical risk indicators of malware, specifically information-stealing and data exfiltration malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports multiple modules with suspicious names such as 'metamask', 'discord', 'exodus', 'machine', 'myweb3toolz.passwords_cards_cookies', 'screenshot', 'telegram', and 'steam'. These names correspond to wallets, token finders, and credential-related tools, which are commonly targeted by malware for credential theft and token extraction. The function 'stha' attempts to import these modules and call functions like 'yea()', 'find_tokens()', 'runner()', 'machineinfo()', 'sikrinsat()', and 'telegram()' inside try-except blocks that suppress all exceptions, a common evasion technique to avoid detection. The code then immediately spawns a background thread to run 'stha' without any user interaction or consent, indicating stealthy execution. The presence of modules and functions named after cryptocurrency wallets and token finders strongly suggests credential or token harvesting. The use of dynamic imports, silent exception handling, and background threading aligns with typical malicious behavior patterns such as information stealing and covert data collection. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven workflow evident. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious intent, including credential/token theft, stealth execution, and evasion techniques."

It uses regular expressions to extract these tokens from local storage files. Then, it compiles the found tokens into a message payload and sends this sensitive information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential harvesting and exfiltration of sensitive user data without consent, which is a classic hallmark of malicious activity. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration, absence of user interaction or consent, and targeting of sensitive token files strongly indicate malicious intent."

It copies these directories to a temporary location, compresses them into a zip archive, and then uploads the archive to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL via an HTTP POST request. This behavior is consistent with unauthorized data exfiltration, specifically targeting browser extension data which may contain sensitive information such as cryptocurrency wallet data or credentials.

It then immediately uploads this screenshot file to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint not related to any legitimate application logic. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user information. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for sending data externally, combined with the silent deletion of the temporary file and absence of any user notification or consent, strongly indicates malicious intent.

This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration, targeting sensitive user data (Telegram session data) and sending it to an attacker-controlled external endpoint. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for exfiltration, absence of error handling transparency, suppression of exceptions, and no legitimate application logic or user notification strongly indicate malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a clear example of malicious behavior, specifically a credential and sensitive data stealer targeting multiple Chromium-based browsers on Windows systems. It enumerates installed browsers by checking known browser data paths, then accesses and decrypts sensitive user data such as saved passwords, cookies, credit card information, browsing history, and download history by reading browser SQLite databases and decrypting encrypted data using the Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData) and AES-GCM with the browser's master key. The stolen data is saved into temporary files under the user's AppData Local Temp directory, then compressed into a ZIP archive. Finally, the archive is exfiltrated by uploading it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is a common technique for covert data exfiltration. The code performs all these actions without any user interaction or consent, silently collecting and sending highly sensitive personal information to an attacker-controlled endpoint. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including credential theft, data exfiltration, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and abuse of Windows cryptographic APIs for unauthorized data decryption. Therefore, this code is malicious."

It then formats this data into a JSON payload and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware that performs system fingerprinting and exfiltrates sensitive host data to an attacker-controlled endpoint. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration, absence of legitimate application logic or user notification, and the unsolicited collection and transmission of sensitive system identifiers are strong indicators of malicious intent."
