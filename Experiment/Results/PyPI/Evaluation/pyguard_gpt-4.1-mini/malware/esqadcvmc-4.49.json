      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is executed via subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW, suppressing any visible window, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The command is triggered conditionally if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting staging or persistence behavior. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) is suspicious and unrelated to legitimate Python package sources. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious code during package installation without user consent. The use of subprocess to run obfuscated PowerShell commands during installation, combined with the suppression of exceptions and lack of legitimate application logic around this execution, strongly indicates malicious intent."
