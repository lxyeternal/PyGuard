      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The command is launched only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated detection or analysis. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package repository. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing arbitrary code execution during package installation. The subprocess.Popen call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and use of suspicious external domains. Therefore, this code is malicious."
