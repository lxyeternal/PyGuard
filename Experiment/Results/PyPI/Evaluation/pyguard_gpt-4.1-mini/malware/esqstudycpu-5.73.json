      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' hint at suspicious or attacker-controlled infrastructure. This execution occurs outside of any user interaction or consent and is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation. These factors combined—hidden execution, obfuscated payload, conditional execution, and embedding in setup.py—are strong indicators of malicious intent."
