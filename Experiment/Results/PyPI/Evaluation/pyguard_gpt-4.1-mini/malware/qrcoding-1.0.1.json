      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that, during package installation, automatically downloads a Python script from a hardcoded, non-standard, and suspicious URL (https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py) without any user interaction or consent. It writes the downloaded content directly to disk as 'qrcodes.py' and immediately executes it using subprocess.check_call with the current Python interpreter. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code during package installation—is a classic and critical indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system without user awareness. The absence of validation, integrity checks, or user notification, combined with the use of a suspicious external URL and execution of untrusted code, strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism embedded in the package installation process."
