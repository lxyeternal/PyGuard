      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is embedded in the package installation process to execute hidden payloads. The use of obfuscated, encrypted data and dynamic execution during setup is a strong indicator of malware. Additionally, the package name 'Matplotlbib' is suspiciously similar to a popular package (matplotlib) but misspelled, which is a common typosquatting technique to trick users into installing malicious packages. The setup script also specifies dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook, further supporting the intent to perform network or cryptographic operations for malicious purposes. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, encrypted malicious code during package installation on Windows systems, which is a high-risk supply chain attack behavior."
