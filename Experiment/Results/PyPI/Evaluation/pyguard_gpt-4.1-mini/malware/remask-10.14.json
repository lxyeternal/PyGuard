      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists and only then runs this hidden command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in a setup script context, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command in this manner is suspicious and typical of malware attempting to run hidden payloads. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses all exceptions, which can hide errors and further evade detection. Overall, the presence of hidden, encoded PowerShell execution triggered during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
