      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to legitimate package sources. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system without user consent or interaction. The rest of the setup.py code appears to be a decoy or cover, but the presence of this hidden execution makes the entire script malicious."
