      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: 1) It contains a hardcoded Discord webhook URL to which it sends a notification immediately upon execution, without any user interaction or consent, indicating unauthorized data exfiltration or alerting an attacker. 2) It clones a GitHub repository from a hardcoded URL into a fixed system path (C:\\Users\\repo) without validation or user notification, which is suspicious and typical of staging or payload delivery. 3) It then changes the working directory to this cloned repository and executes a Python script ('bypass.py') from it via subprocess.run, effectively running potentially untrusted code fetched from the internet. 4) This entire sequence is embedded in the setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system without explicit consent. 5) The use of network communication libraries (requests, gitpython) combined with subprocess execution and hardcoded external URLs/webhooks strongly aligns with malicious patterns such as remote code execution, payload delivery, and data exfiltration. Based on these factors and the provided knowledge points, this code is malicious."

Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and should be classified as malicious."

Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."

Overall, this code is highly suspicious and consistent with malware behavior, likely part of a supply chain attack or remote access trojan delivery mechanism."
