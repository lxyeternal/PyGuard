      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Windows systems, specifically extracting sensitive information from browsers, Discord clients, and Telegram. It collects Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords, billing information, and user environment data such as IP address and username. The code decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData) and AES-GCM with the master key extracted from the browser's Local State. It searches for tokens and credentials in various local storage paths of popular browsers and Discord variants. The stolen data is exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL (https://webhook.wyvern.lol) and also uploaded to anonymous file hosting services (e.g., gofile.io). The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, suppresses exceptions, and runs multiple threads to collect and send data stealthily. It forcibly kills processes (e.g., browsers, Telegram) to access locked files, zips sensitive directories, and uploads them. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, extensive credential harvesting, decryption of protected data, and exfiltration without user consent are definitive indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
