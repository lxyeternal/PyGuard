      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or sandbox environments. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup or installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and lack of user notification or consent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
