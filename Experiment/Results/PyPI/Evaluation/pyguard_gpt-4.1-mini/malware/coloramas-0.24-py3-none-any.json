      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It silently checks for the existence of specific directories and files related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet in the user's AppData and common user folders without any user interaction or consent. It then attempts to collect sensitive wallet files (configuration, passphrase, seed, two-factor authentication secrets) and password files from Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders. These files are compressed into a ZIP archive named with the username and stored in a hidden-like directory. The script then gathers the victim's public IP address and country code via external HTTP requests. It constructs a message including the username and country flag, and exfiltrates both the message and the ZIP archive containing sensitive wallet data to a hardcoded Telegram bot API endpoint using a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. The code suppresses exceptions to avoid detection and deletes the ZIP archive after sending, indicating anti-forensics behavior. The use of hardcoded Telegram bot credentials and chat ID for data exfiltration, combined with targeting sensitive wallet files and no legitimate application logic or user consent, strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at stealing cryptocurrency wallet credentials and related secrets."
