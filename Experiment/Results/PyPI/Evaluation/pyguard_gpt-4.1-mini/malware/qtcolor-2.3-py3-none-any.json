      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses obfuscation by storing an XOR-encrypted payload in the variable 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' and a numeric key string in 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp'. The code decrypts this payload by XORing each character with a corresponding character from the key, reconstructing a string that is then executed dynamically using eval(compile(...)). This dynamic execution of obfuscated code is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling arbitrary code execution while evading static analysis. Furthermore, immediately after executing the decrypted payload, the script deletes its own source file using os.remove(os.path.abspath(__file__)), which is a self-deleting behavior typical of malware to hinder forensic analysis and detection. There is no user interaction, no legitimate application logic, and the obfuscation combined with self-deletion strongly indicates malicious intent."
