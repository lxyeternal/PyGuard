      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, suppressing any visible window, which is typical for malware trying to evade detection. The command is executed conditionally if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a staging or persistence check. The URL embedded in the encoded command (cdnd.discordapp.com) is a non-standard source for legitimate package operations and is likely used to download or execute further malicious payloads. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation without user consent, a common supply chain attack vector. The use of try-except blocks that silently pass exceptions further suggests an attempt to avoid detection or error reporting. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden execution of external commands, suspicious URL usage, and execution during package setup strongly classifies this code as malicious."
