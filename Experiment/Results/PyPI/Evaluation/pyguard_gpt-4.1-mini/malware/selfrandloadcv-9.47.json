      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or detection. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command string is suspicious and likely to spawn a hidden process. Additionally, this execution occurs in the setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing arbitrary code execution during package installation. The author and email fields appear to be fake or unrelated to any legitimate project, and the comment referencing a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) further raises suspicion. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, with no legitimate application logic or user consent, classifies this code as malicious."
