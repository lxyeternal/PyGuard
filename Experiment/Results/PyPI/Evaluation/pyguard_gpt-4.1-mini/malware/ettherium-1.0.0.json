      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. This execution happens silently during package installation without user consent or interaction, a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during install strongly indicates an attempt to hide malicious code execution. The setup metadata is nonsensical and does not correspond to any legitimate package. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) in the install hook further suggests potential for network communication or payload delivery. Overall, this pattern matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk indicators of malicious Python code, including arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, and use of encrypted payloads executed without user knowledge."
