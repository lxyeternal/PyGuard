      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute arbitrary code during installation without user consent. The run() method checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. The payload is obfuscated and encrypted, hiding its true intent, which is a common malware technique to evade detection. The use of exec() on decrypted data during installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system. The package metadata and class names are obfuscated and meaningless, further indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. The setup script also specifies Windows as the target OS, aligning with the conditional execution of the malicious payload. Overall, this pattern matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk indicators of malicious Python code, including code execution at install time, obfuscation, encrypted payload execution, and lack of user interaction or notification."
