      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or analysis. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a setup script for a Python package. Such behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware embedded in package installation scripts. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, combined with the lack of error handling and silent exception suppression, strongly indicates malicious intent."
