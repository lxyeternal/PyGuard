      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell backdoor. It repeatedly queries a suspicious external domain ('poiqwe.info') via DNS TXT records to obtain a port number, then establishes a TCP connection to that domain and port. It duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error, and spawns an interactive shell (/bin/bash) connected to the remote host. This allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the victim machine without user consent or interaction. Additionally, if the script is imported as a module (not run as main), it silently sends an HTTP GET request to 'http://poiqwe.info/install_bad', which is suspicious and likely used for tracking or triggering further malicious actions. The use of hardcoded suspicious domain, network communication without user consent, spawning a shell over a socket, and silent external HTTP request are all strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that perform HTTP GET requests to hardcoded, suspicious external URLs (http://poiqwe.info/install_post_dev, http://poiqwe.info/install_post, http://poiqwe.info/install_pre_dev, http://poiqwe.info/install_pre) during package installation and development setup phases. These requests occur without any user interaction or consent, embedded directly in the installation lifecycle, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The domain poiqwe.info is non-standard and unrelated to typical package sources, raising suspicion of data exfiltration or remote command-and-control communication. The code lacks any legitimate application logic around these network calls, no error handling, no user notification, and no validation of the remote responses. This pattern—network communication to suspicious hardcoded URLs triggered automatically during package installation—is strongly associated with malicious behavior, including remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further payload delivery. Therefore, this code is malicious."
