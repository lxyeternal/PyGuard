      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py). It collects detailed system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive system information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This exfiltration of system fingerprinting data without user consent or notification is a classic malicious behavior pattern. The code runs automatically during installation without user interaction, uses hardcoded external endpoints for data exfiltration, and collects sensitive environment and network information. These factors strongly indicate that the code is designed for covert data collection and exfiltration, consistent with malware or a supply chain attack vector."
