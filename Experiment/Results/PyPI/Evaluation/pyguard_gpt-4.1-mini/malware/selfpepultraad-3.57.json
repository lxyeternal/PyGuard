      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of malware. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or ensure environment suitability. The PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) to download or execute further code, which is unrelated to the stated purpose of the package and is a common vector for remote code execution and payload delivery. The entire malicious execution is embedded within a setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute code during package installation without user awareness. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags to hide the window further confirms the intent to conceal malicious activity. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. These factors combined confirm that the code is malicious."
