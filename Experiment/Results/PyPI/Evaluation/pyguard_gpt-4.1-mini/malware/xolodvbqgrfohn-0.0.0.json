      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and dynamic execution via exec(). The decoded payload is executed immediately, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such obfuscation is commonly used to hide the true purpose of the code and evade static analysis. The code uses multiple layers of string replacements to further obscure the actual executed code. This pattern matches critical risk indicators for malware, including dynamic code execution of decoded payloads, obfuscation, and lack of transparency. Given these factors and the extensive use of exec on decoded data, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
