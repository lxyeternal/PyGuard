      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe) without any user interaction, validation, or consent, writes it directly to disk, and immediately executes it using subprocess.Popen. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system. The absence of error handling, user notification, or integrity checks, combined with the direct execution of a downloaded executable from an untrusted source, strongly indicates malicious intent. Such behavior is commonly used for payload delivery, persistence, or further compromise, and is consistently associated with malware in the provided knowledge base."
