      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically using exec and compile functions. This payload imports modules dynamically and performs a network request to a suspicious hardcoded URL ('https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/7bupb/raw'), reads the response, writes it to a temporary file, and then executes it as a shell command. This behavior is triggered during the package setup process, which means arbitrary code is executed at install time without user consent. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic code execution, network fetching of executable content, and execution of that content is a classic hallmark of malicious code, often used in supply chain attacks or malware delivery. The rest of the setup.py script appears benign, but the embedded obfuscated payload and its execution during installation is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. At the very beginning, it uses base64 decoding combined with exec and compile to dynamically execute obfuscated code. The decoded payload imports modules like tempfile, sys, os, and urllib.request, then creates a temporary file and writes the content fetched from a hardcoded suspicious URL ('https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/7bupb/raw') into this file. It then executes this downloaded content via os.system with a command that replaces '.exe' with 'w.exe' in the temporary filename, indicating execution of a potentially malicious executable. This pattern of downloading and executing code from an external URL without user consent, combined with obfuscation via base64 encoding and dynamic execution, is a classic hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. The rest of the code appears to be a benign terminal color and animation library, but the initial obfuscated payload execution is a critical risk and confirms malicious intent."
