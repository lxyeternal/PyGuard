      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which decodes to a PowerShell invocation that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and runs it silently. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and executes a remote payload without user consent or interaction. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which may be an evasion or staging technique. The presence of this code inside a setup script (using distutils.core.setup) suggests it is designed to execute during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The author and email fields reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which do not correspond to any known legitimate package and may be a pseudonym. The combination of obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, remote payload download from a non-standard domain, and execution during package installation strongly classifies this code as malicious."
