      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is highly obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and compression to conceal its true functionality. Specifically, it reverses a base64-encoded string, then decompresses it using zlib, deserializes it with marshal, and finally executes the resulting code with exec. This pattern of obfuscation and dynamic code execution is a strong and well-known indicator of malicious intent. Such techniques are commonly used by malware authors to evade static analysis and hide payloads that may perform unauthorized actions such as downloading further malware, exfiltrating data, or executing arbitrary commands on the victim system. The absence of any legitimate application logic, combined with the use of exec on decoded and decompressed data, aligns with critical risk indicators for malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
