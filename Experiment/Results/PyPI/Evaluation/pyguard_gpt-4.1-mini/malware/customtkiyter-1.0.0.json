      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code at install time strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the package setup specifies dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests' solely to support this hidden payload execution. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code execution during install, use of cryptography to hide payloads, and lack of transparency or legitimate application logic surrounding the network or execution actions."
