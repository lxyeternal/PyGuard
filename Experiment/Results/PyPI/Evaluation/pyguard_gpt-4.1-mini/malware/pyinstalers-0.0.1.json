      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically using exec and compile, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload imports modules to perform HTTP requests to a hardcoded suspicious IP address (http://20.226.18.203) and fetches data from endpoints named 'grab' and 'clip'. It writes the fetched data to a temporary file and executes it, then closes the file. The code attempts to start a system command with the temporary file's name, replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe', which is suspicious and indicative of executing downloaded payloads. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic code execution, hardcoded external IP addresses, and execution of downloaded content without user consent are all classic hallmarks of malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the code is designed to fetch and run potentially malicious code from an external source, which is a critical security risk."
