      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden window, which is a classic pattern of remote payload retrieval and execution. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or ensure environment suitability. This execution happens during the package setup process without user consent or notification, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The presence of a suspicious author email and domain (EsqueleSquad, tahgoficial@proton.me, www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports malicious intent. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is used as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a potentially harmful executable on Windows systems during package installation, which is a high-risk malicious behavior."
