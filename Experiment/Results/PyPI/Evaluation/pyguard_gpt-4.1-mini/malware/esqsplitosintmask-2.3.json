      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and executes a downloaded executable named 'WindowsCache.exe'. This behavior is consistent with downloading and executing a remote payload without user consent, a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which may be an evasion or staging technique. The malicious payload execution is embedded in the setup script, which means it triggers during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated, encoded commands, hidden execution, and remote payload retrieval strongly indicates malicious intent."
