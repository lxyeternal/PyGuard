      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute hidden malicious code during installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). It imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules dynamically and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing obfuscated code at install time without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malware. The use of an encrypted payload hides the true intent of the code, evading static analysis. The package name 'playwirght' is a typo-squatting variant of the legitimate 'playwright' package, which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The setup script also specifies Windows as the target OS, and the malicious code only triggers on Windows, indicating targeted attack behavior. Overall, this code abuses the installation process to execute arbitrary, hidden code, which is a critical risk and a hallmark of malicious Python packages."
