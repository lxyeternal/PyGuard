      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class GruppeInstall that overrides the run() method to execute arbitrary code during package installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). Inside the run method, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and immediately executes the decrypted code with exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of obfuscated encrypted payload hides the true behavior from static analysis. The code executes this payload silently during installation, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, potential downloading of further malware, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The package metadata is also suspicious with meaningless author and description fields, and the package name 'requesks' is a typo-squatting variant of 'requests', a popular library, which is a common tactic in malicious PyPI packages. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including arbitrary code execution during install, obfuscated payload, use of cryptography to hide intent, and execution of decrypted code without validation or user interaction."
