      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the stated package purpose. The malicious payload is embedded directly in the setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute code during package installation without user consent. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a hallmark of malware aiming for stealth, persistence, or further payload execution. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package setup, and use of suspicious external domains, confirming it is malicious."
