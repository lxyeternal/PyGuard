      "malicious_behavior": "The code fetches content from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://pettish-morning.000webhostapp.com/code.php) without any user interaction or consent. It then decodes the fetched content from base64 and immediately executes it using exec(). This pattern of downloading obfuscated code from an untrusted remote source and executing it dynamically is a classic and strong indicator of malicious behavior. The use of threading to run this code in the background further suggests an attempt to evade detection. There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification before executing the remote code, which poses a critical security risk and is consistent with malware delivery and execution techniques."
