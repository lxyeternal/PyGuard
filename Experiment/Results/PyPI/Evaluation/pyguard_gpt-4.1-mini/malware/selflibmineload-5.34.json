      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious GitHub raw URL (https://github.com/T4Hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) without user consent or interaction. This occurs conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a staging or persistence mechanism. The use of encoded commands, hidden window execution, and downloading executables from non-standard, suspicious URLs during package setup is a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. The silent exception handling further suppresses errors to avoid detection. All these factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent."
