      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting staging or persistence behavior. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to legitimate package sources. This execution occurs during the setup process, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag further indicates an attempt to hide the execution window and evade user detection. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution triggered during package installation."
