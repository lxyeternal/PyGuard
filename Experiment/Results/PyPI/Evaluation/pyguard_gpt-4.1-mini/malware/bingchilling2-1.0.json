      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python snippet to a temporary file that dynamically fetches and executes code from a hardcoded, external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/7byac/raw) without any user interaction or consent. It then attempts to execute this temporary file using a system shell command, effectively running remote code during the package installation process. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code at install time via setup.py—is a classic and critical indicator of malicious behavior, commonly used in supply chain attacks. The use of os.system to spawn a new process running the downloaded code, combined with the absence of validation, error handling, or user notification, further confirms the malicious intent. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system, posing a severe security risk."
