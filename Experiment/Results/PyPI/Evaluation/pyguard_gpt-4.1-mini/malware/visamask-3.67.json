      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this hidden command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user consent or interaction, and is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which serves as a cover for the malicious payload. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with known malware patterns for remote code execution, stealth, and persistence."
