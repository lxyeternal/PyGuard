      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent. The use of encrypted payload hides the true intent of the code, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The package name 'Matploltlib' is a typo-squatting attempt to mimic the legitimate 'matplotlib' package, a common tactic in supply chain attacks. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook, further indicating the network and cryptography dependencies are for malicious purposes. The code executes arbitrary decrypted code at install time, which can lead to remote code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise. This pattern is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware."
