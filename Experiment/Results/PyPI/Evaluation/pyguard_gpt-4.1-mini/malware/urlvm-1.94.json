      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. This execution happens immediately upon import or setup script execution, without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation process. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup is a critical risk indicator of malware, consistent with known malicious patterns for remote code execution, persistence, or payload delivery."
