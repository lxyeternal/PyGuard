      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class (GruppeInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a critical red flag because it enables arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent or interaction, a common vector for supply chain attacks and malware delivery. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution within the installation process is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true payload from static analysis and executes potentially harmful code on the victim's machine. Additionally, the package metadata contains nonsensical or obfuscated strings, which is typical in malicious packages to evade detection. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) used only in the install hook further supports the conclusion that the package is designed to execute hidden malicious code during installation."
