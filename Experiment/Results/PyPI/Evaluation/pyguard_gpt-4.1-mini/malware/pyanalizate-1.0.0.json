      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and compression (base64, zlib) combined with dynamic evaluation (eval, exec). It reconstructs code from encoded integer sequences and executes it dynamically, which is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior designed to evade static analysis. The code imports modules and then uses eval on decompressed and decoded payloads, indicating arbitrary code execution. The presence of obfuscated strings, lambda functions with confusing variable names, and execution of dynamically generated code strongly suggests intent to hide malicious payloads. Such patterns are consistent with malware that downloads, decompresses, decodes, and executes hidden payloads at runtime, potentially for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the obfuscation is excessive and unnecessary for benign purposes. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
