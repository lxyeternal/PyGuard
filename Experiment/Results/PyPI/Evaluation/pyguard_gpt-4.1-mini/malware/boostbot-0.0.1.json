      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup.py installation script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. During the install and develop commands, it executes a function that downloads a batch script from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL hosted on Discord's CDN (https:/cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...). The downloaded file 'install.bat' is written directly to disk without any validation or user consent, and then executed via os.system with environment variable manipulation and shell command to run it as an invoker. This pattern of downloading and executing an external script during package installation without user interaction is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The use of a non-standard URL unrelated to the package's stated purpose, absence of error handling, and execution of arbitrary code from the internet during install time further confirm the malicious intent. This behavior can lead to system compromise, persistence, and further payload delivery, making it a critical security risk."
