      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup.py script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The function zzr() executes immediately during installation and performs the following suspicious actions: it checks if the platform is Windows, then downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, non-standard, suspicious URL (a GitHub raw URL under a user jagermager999 with a random-looking filename). It writes the downloaded content directly to disk with a suspicious temporary filename and immediately executes it using os.system with the 'start' command, which launches the executable without user consent or validation. There is no error handling, no user interaction, and no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as remote payload retrieval, writing and executing a downloaded executable, execution during package installation, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and lack of transparency or validation. Therefore, this code is malicious and likely intended to download and run malware on the victim's machine."
