      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64 string that, when decoded, likely contains a PowerShell script that contacts a suspicious external URL (cdndiscardapp.com) to download or execute further payloads. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation, without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The domain and author information (EsqueleSquad, tahgoficial@proton.me) do not correspond to any known legitimate package or source. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. These factors combined match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, use of encoded PowerShell commands, and execution during package installation, all of which are hallmark behaviors of malicious code."
