      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions silently. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of this execution in a setup script (commonly run during package installation) suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during installation without user knowledge. The author and email fields appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate packages. All these factors combined—hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell command during package setup, obfuscation, silent failure handling, and suspicious directory checks—are strong indicators of malicious intent."
