      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and runs it as a hidden process. This occurs conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a staging or persistence mechanism. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The domain and file being downloaded are unrelated to the stated package purpose and author, and the entire operation is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. All these factors combined strongly indicate that this code is malicious."
