      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: it creates a hidden or suspicious directory (C:\\$Windows.~SXK), downloads executable files from hardcoded, non-standard URLs hosted on Discord CDN, writes these executables to the hidden directory with suspicious filenames, and immediately executes them without any user interaction or consent. It also attempts to remove traces by deleting the downloaded files and the directory afterward. The use of requests to fetch executables and os.startfile to run them directly is a classic pattern of remote payload retrieval and execution, commonly seen in malware. The code suppresses exceptions silently, avoiding detection, and performs these actions during or alongside a package setup script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of hardcoded URLs pointing to executable payloads, writing and running them from a hidden system-like directory, and the lack of any legitimate application logic or user notification confirm that this code is malicious."
