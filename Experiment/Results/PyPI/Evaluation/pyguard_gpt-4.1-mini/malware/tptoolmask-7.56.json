      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and unrelated to any known legitimate package. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code is embedded in installation scripts. The subprocess call runs without user consent or interaction, in a hidden window, and executes an encoded command, all of which are strong indicators of malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious and likely part of a malware or backdoor delivery mechanism."
