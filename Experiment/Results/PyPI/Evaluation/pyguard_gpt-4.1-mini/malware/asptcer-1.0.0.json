      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, after running the standard install process, it collects system information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://9.30.214.68:9090). This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: it performs network communication during package installation without user consent, exfiltrates potentially sensitive system information to a hardcoded external IP, and uses a non-standard IP address rather than a legitimate or documented endpoint. The code is embedded in the setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks and remote code execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data exfiltration. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware and supply chain attack patterns."
