      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or analysis. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. The silent exception handling (except: pass) suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated payload during installation, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
