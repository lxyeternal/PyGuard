      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). This means arbitrary code execution occurs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload and exec() in the install hook is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling stealthy execution of potentially malicious code. The obfuscated class name, meaningless description strings, and the presence of network-related modules (requests) further support malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution at install time, use of encrypted payloads, and execution of decrypted code, all without user notification or validation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
