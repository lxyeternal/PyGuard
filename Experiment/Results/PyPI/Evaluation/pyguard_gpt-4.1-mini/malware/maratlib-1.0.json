      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names and contains two functions (l111ll1l_lol_ and l1ll1ll11_lol_) that decode and evaluate obfuscated strings dynamically using eval. The code imports sys.version_info to detect Python 2 or 3 and uses large constants and arithmetic to decode strings. The key malicious indicator is the use of eval on dynamically decoded strings, which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique enabling arbitrary code execution. Furthermore, the code calls setup() from setuptools with parameters decoded via these functions, indicating that malicious code is embedded in the package installation process, a known supply chain attack vector. The code also imports a module dynamically and calls getoutput() on a decoded command string, which likely executes shell commands. This pattern of obfuscated dynamic code execution during package installation, combined with shell command execution, is a strong hallmark of malware. The absence of any legitimate application logic, the obfuscation, and the dynamic eval usage strongly indicate that this code is malicious and designed to execute hidden payloads during installation."
