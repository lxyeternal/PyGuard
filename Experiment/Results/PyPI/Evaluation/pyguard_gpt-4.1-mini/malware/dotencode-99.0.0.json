      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, after running the standard install process, it collects system information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eol6mx6at717hhs.m.pipedream.net/dotencode). This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns: it executes network communication without user consent during package installation (a supply chain attack vector), collects potentially sensitive system information, and exfiltrates it to an external endpoint unrelated to the package's stated purpose. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard domain and the absence of any legitimate application logic or user interaction further indicate malicious intent. This pattern is a strong indicator of malware, as it enables remote data exfiltration triggered automatically during package installation, which is a common tactic in malicious Python packages."
