      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior characterized by the following: It base64-decodes a hardcoded URL that points to an external IP address (http://119.8.26.163:58888/p/b66886/os11/), which is suspicious and not related to any legitimate package repository or service. It then executes a shell command 'whoami' to retrieve the current system username and immediately sends this sensitive system information via an HTTP POST request to the decoded external URL without any user interaction or consent. This pattern of environment discovery followed by immediate data exfiltration to a hardcoded, obfuscated external endpoint is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. Furthermore, this network activity is embedded directly in the setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The absence of error handling, logging, or any legitimate application logic surrounding this network communication further supports the malicious intent. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL is an obfuscation technique to evade detection. All these factors combined indicate that the code is designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate sensitive system information to an attacker-controlled server, classifying it as malicious."
