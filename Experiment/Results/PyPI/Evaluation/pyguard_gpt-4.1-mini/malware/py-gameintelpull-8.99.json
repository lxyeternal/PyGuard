      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package. The malicious payload is embedded directly in the setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute code during package installation without user consent. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag further indicates an attempt to hide the execution window and evade user awareness. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealthy process spawning, and execution triggered during package setup."
