      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or analysis. This execution happens silently without user consent or notification, and the use of hidden PowerShell with encoded commands is a hallmark of malware aiming for stealth, persistence, or further payload delivery. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing arbitrary code execution during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the presence of the hidden encoded PowerShell execution makes the entire code malicious."
