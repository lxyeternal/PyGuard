      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It embeds a base64-encoded URL in the TELEMETRY_INFO variable, which decodes to a raw GitHub URL hosting a base64-encoded payload. In the PostEggInfoCommand class, which is hooked into the egg_info setuptools command (triggered during package installation or development setup), the code conditionally (only on Windows, os.name == 'nt') fetches this remote payload via urllib.request.urlopen, decodes it from base64, and then executes it by spawning a new Python process with subprocess.Popen. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code is downloaded and executed during package installation without user consent or validation. The use of base64 encoding for the URL and the payload obscures the intent and evades static detection. The execution occurs silently during the egg_info phase, which is unusual for legitimate packages. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network fetch and remote code execution. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary remote code execution during install, obfuscation via base64 encoding, execution of downloaded code without validation, and use of subprocess to spawn hidden processes. Therefore, this code is malicious."
