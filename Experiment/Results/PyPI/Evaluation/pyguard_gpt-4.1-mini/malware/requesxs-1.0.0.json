      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known vector for executing arbitrary code during package installation (a supply chain attack pattern). Inside the overridden run() method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution from an obfuscated source. This execution happens silently during installation without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution hides the true intent and evades static analysis. The package name 'requesxs' is suspiciously similar to 'requests', possibly to deceive users. The code only triggers on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), which suggests targeted malicious behavior. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious payload execution context. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators: code execution at install time, obfuscated payload decryption and execution, use of dynamic imports and exec, and no legitimate application logic surrounding the network or execution actions. Therefore, this code is malicious."
