      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. This decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, encrypted payload, and execution during package installation strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector. The package name 'requiirementsxt' is suspiciously similar to the legitimate 'requirements' naming, suggesting typosquatting. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook. The encrypted payload is not visible in plaintext, hiding the true intent of the code. Executing decrypted code during installation without user interaction or validation is a hallmark of malicious behavior, enabling remote code execution, potential payload delivery, or system compromise. Therefore, this code is malicious."
