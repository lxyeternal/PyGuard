      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. This behavior is embedded in the setup script, which means it executes during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, combined with the silent exception handling (try-except pass), strongly indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy, unauthorized code execution during package installation."
