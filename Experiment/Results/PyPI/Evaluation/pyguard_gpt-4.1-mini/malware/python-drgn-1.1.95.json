      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py install hook). It collects detailed system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration (ifconfig/ipconfig), public IP address (via HTTP GET to http://ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive system and environment information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL (https://hooks.slack.com/services/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) without any user consent or notification. This behavior is a classic example of information gathering and exfiltration embedded in a package installation script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration, execution of shell commands to gather system info, and automatic network communication during install time without user interaction or legitimate application logic strongly indicate malicious intent."
