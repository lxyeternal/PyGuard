      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The command is launched only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated detection or to check for analysis environments. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and not related to legitimate package sources. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover, with a generic description and package name that do not match the malicious behavior. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during package installation or execution, a classic supply chain attack vector, and is highly likely to be malicious."
