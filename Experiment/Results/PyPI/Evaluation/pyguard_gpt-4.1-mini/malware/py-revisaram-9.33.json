      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads or executes content from a suspicious URL (cdndiscardapp.com), which is unrelated to the stated purpose of the package. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or ensure persistence. This execution happens silently during the package setup process without user consent or interaction, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags to hide the window further confirms the intent to evade user awareness. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated remote code during installation, which is a hallmark of malware."
