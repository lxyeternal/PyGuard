      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is launched via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, suppressing any visible window, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The command is executed conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests staging or evasion logic. The encoded command likely downloads or executes further malicious payloads from a suspicious URL (not a standard or trusted domain). This behavior is embedded in the setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The presence of obfuscated, encoded commands, hidden execution, and suspicious domain references strongly indicate malicious intent."
