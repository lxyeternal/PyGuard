      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a conditional execution pattern often used by malware to avoid repeated execution or detection. The PowerShell command references a suspicious GitHub URL (github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe), which appears unrelated to any legitimate package functionality and suggests downloading or executing a remote payload. This execution occurs during the setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to run malicious code during package installation without user consent. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command string is unusual and likely to spawn a hidden process. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution, conditional directory check, and remote URL referencing in a setup script strongly indicates malicious intent."
