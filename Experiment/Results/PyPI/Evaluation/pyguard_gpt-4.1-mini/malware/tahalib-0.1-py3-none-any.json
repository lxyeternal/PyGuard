      "malicious_behavior": "The code reads stored Chrome browser passwords from the user's local Chrome 'Login Data' SQLite database, decrypts them using Windows DPAPI and Chrome's AES encryption key, writes the decrypted credentials (website URL, username, and password) to a local file 'passwords.txt', and then exfiltrates this file by uploading it to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential theft and data exfiltration without user consent. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for sending sensitive data, absence of user interaction or notification, and silent exception handling further confirm malicious intent. Such actions are classic hallmarks of information-stealing malware."
