      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install process. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. This decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. The use of an encrypted payload embedded in the install script, combined with execution during package installation, is a classic supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. The setup script also specifies 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup requirements, which are used only in the malicious install hook. This pattern matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk indicators such as: code execution during install, use of encrypted payloads, dynamic imports, and lack of user interaction or notification. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to execute hidden arbitrary code on Windows systems during package installation."
