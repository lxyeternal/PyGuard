      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known vector for executing arbitrary code during package installation (a supply chain attack pattern). Inside the overridden run() method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' only on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload and immediately executes it with exec(). This is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution of an obfuscated payload at install time without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload hides the true intent and evades static analysis. The package setup includes these dependencies and triggers this code automatically during installation, which is a classic malicious pattern for remote code execution and potential further payload delivery. The obfuscated description and author details further suggest concealment. Overall, this is a high-risk supply chain attack vector that executes hidden malicious code during package installation."
