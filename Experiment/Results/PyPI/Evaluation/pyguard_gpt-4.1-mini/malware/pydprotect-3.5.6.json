      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a heavily obfuscated and compressed Python payload to a file named 'mal.pyw' in the user's AppData directory and immediately executes it using startfile. The payload is stored as a zlib-compressed byte string embedded in the variable 'mal', which is then written and executed without any user interaction or consent. The obfuscation includes use of hex-encoded strings, lambda functions, dynamic imports, and eval/compile on decompressed data, all classic indicators of malicious intent. Writing executable code to a user directory and executing it without transparency or validation is a common persistence and payload delivery technique in malware. The use of environment variables to locate the AppData folder and the immediate execution of the dropped file further confirm this is a malicious drop-and-execute pattern. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as dynamic code execution from obfuscated payloads, file writing to user directories, and stealth execution without user consent."
