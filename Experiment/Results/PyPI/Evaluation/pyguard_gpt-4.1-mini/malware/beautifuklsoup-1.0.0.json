      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing arbitrary, obfuscated code at install time without user consent, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the package name 'BeautifuklSoup' is a typo-squatting variant of the legitimate 'BeautifulSoup' package, which is a known tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The setup script also specifies dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for the malicious payload execution. The encrypted payload and the lack of any legitimate application logic further confirm that this code is designed to execute hidden malicious code during installation, posing a critical security risk."
