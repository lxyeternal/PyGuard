      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common method to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) which appears to be a remote payload download or execution attempt. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure environment suitability. This execution happens silently without user consent or interaction, embedded in a setup script context, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad', 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and the commented URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) further suggest malicious intent. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, encoded PowerShell payload, execution during package setup, and use of suspicious external URLs, all of which are hallmark signs of malware."
