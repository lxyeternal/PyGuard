      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence tactic. This execution happens at import or setup time without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script, a known vector for supply chain attacks. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a hallmark of malware attempting to execute arbitrary code stealthily. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
