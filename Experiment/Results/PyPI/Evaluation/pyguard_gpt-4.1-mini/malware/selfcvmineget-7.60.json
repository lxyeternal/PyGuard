      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed without user consent or interaction, indicating covert activity. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The presence of a suspicious author name 'EsqueleSquad' and an email address 'tahgoficial@proton.me' combined with the obfuscated PowerShell command and the comment referencing a suspicious domain 'www.esquelesquad.rip' strongly suggests malicious intent. Additionally, the malicious payload is embedded within a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution during package installation without user awareness. All these factors combined confirm that the code is malicious."
