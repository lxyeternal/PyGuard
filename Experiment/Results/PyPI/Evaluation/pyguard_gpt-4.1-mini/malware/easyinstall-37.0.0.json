      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The function rn() performs the following suspicious actions without user consent or notification: it attempts to download data from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (145.249.104.71) via HTTP GET request to the path '/out'. The downloaded content is saved as a file named '.drv' in the user's home directory, the file permissions are modified to make it executable, and an entry is appended to the user's '.bashrc' file to execute this file on shell startup, establishing persistence. Finally, the code immediately executes the downloaded file using os.system. These actions—downloading and executing a remote payload, modifying user startup scripts for persistence, and doing so during package installation—are classic hallmarks of malware and supply chain attacks. The use of a hardcoded IP address instead of a legitimate domain, lack of validation or user interaction, and execution of potentially untrusted code further confirm the malicious intent."

It saves this file as a hidden executable ('.drv') in the user's home directory on Linux systems, sets the executable permission, and modifies the user's .bashrc to run this file in the background on shell startup. This sequence is a classic pattern of remote payload retrieval and persistence mechanism, commonly used by malware to maintain foothold on the system. The absence of validation, user notification, or legitimate application logic, combined with the use of a hardcoded IP address and automatic execution on shell startup, strongly indicates malicious intent."
