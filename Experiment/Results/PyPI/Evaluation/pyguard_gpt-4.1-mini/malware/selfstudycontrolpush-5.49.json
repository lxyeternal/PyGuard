      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed without user consent or interaction. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or persistence tactic. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The author and email fields reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which do not correspond to any known legitimate package or author, and the comment includes a suspicious URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip'. All these factors combined strongly indicate that this code is malicious."
