      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute a reverse shell payload immediately upon package installation. Specifically, it constructs a Python reverse shell command that connects to a hardcoded external domain ('e6j4342057.zicp.fun') on port 26264, duplicates the socket file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, and spawns a bash shell. This payload is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via a shell command using os.system during the install process. This behavior enables unauthorized remote code execution and remote control of the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The use of a hardcoded suspicious domain, execution of shell commands during installation, base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload, and spawning of a reverse shell are all classic and strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks and remote access trojans (RATs). Therefore, this code is malicious."
