      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64 string that, when decoded, runs an Invoke-WebRequest to download and execute an executable named 'Esquele.exe' from a suspicious and non-standard domain 'cdn.discordapp.com' under a path that looks like an attacker's hosting. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens immediately upon import or setup, without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy or cover, with legitimate-looking metadata but no actual benign logic to justify the network activity. These patterns match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload delivery, stealth execution, use of encoded PowerShell commands, and execution during package installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
