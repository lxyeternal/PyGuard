      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command during the package setup process that uses PowerShell to download an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mkd3enun97s8zag/Oxzy.exe?dl=0) and saves it as '~/WindowsCache.exe'. It then immediately executes this downloaded file via Invoke-Expression. This behavior occurs without any user interaction or consent, and it is embedded directly in the setup script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses the console window, indicating an attempt to hide the execution. The downloaded executable is placed in a user home directory path, which is a common tactic for persistence or evasion. There is no validation, integrity check, or notification regarding the downloaded file. The code also attempts to install the subprocess module dynamically if not present, which is unusual and suspicious. All these factors strongly indicate malicious intent, as the code downloads and executes untrusted code during package installation, a classic hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks."
