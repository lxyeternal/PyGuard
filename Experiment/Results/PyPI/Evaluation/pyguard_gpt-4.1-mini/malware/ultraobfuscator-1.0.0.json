      "malicious_behavior": "The code is obfuscated by encoding the entire script as a list of ASCII codes and then executing it via exec(), which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. The decoded script imports multiple modules related to network communication, subprocess execution, and system operations. It defines a function that clones a GitHub repository from a hardcoded URL into a user directory, changes the working directory to that repository, and then runs a Python script ('bypass.py') from that repository using subprocess. This behavior indicates automatic downloading and execution of remote code without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of malicious activity. The use of subprocess to run code from an externally fetched repository, combined with obfuscation and lack of validation or user notification, strongly suggests this code is designed to execute potentially harmful payloads. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
