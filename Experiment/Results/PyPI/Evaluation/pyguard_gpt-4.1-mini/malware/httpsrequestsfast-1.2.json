      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module named 'httpsrequestsfast', which is not a standard or widely recognized Python library. The suspicious and non-standard module name suggests potential obfuscation or a trojanized package designed to mimic legitimate HTTP request libraries. Given the context of typical malicious code patterns, such unusual imports often serve as entry points for malicious payloads, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities. Without any further code, the mere presence of this import from a suspiciously named module is a strong indicator of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily collect Discord authentication tokens from various local storage paths associated with Discord and multiple Chromium-based browsers. It searches for tokens using regex patterns in LevelDB files without any user consent or interaction. It then validates these tokens by making authenticated requests to Discord's API. For valid tokens, it retrieves sensitive user information such as email, phone number, and billing/payment method status. The collected data, along with the victim's IP address (obtained via the Receiver class), is encoded and sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL (which is base64-encoded in the code). This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential theft and data exfiltration. The use of hardcoded webhook URLs, silent exception handling, no user notification, and the targeting of sensitive user data strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware. The code does not perform any legitimate application logic and is solely focused on harvesting and exfiltrating sensitive Discord credentials and user information."
