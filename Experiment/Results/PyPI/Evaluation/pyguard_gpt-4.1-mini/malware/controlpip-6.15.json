      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. This execution happens at import or setup time without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call from distutils.core, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands and no error handling or logging strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, obfuscated payload delivery, execution during package installation, and lack of transparency or user notification."
