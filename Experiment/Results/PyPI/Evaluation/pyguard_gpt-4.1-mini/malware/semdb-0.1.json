It includes execution of code during package installation (setup.py), which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The code performs environment inspection, collects system and user information, and sends it to external, suspicious domains. It creates and writes files with obfuscated or random names in user directories, then executes them, indicating potential for persistence or further payload deployment. The presence of dynamic imports, execution of shell commands, and network communication to hardcoded URLs without user consent are strong indicators of malicious behavior. The code also uses threading and subprocesses to evade detection and maintain persistence. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators consistent with malware, including remote code execution, data exfiltration, and stealthy payload deployment."
