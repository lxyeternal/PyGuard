      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is highly obfuscated and contains a large base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed via exec(). This execution occurs conditionally during the package installation process (when 'sdist' is not in argv and the OS is Windows). The decoded payload includes operations such as writing to a temporary file with a suspicious name, executing shell commands, and likely performing network or system reconnaissance activities. The use of base64 decoding combined with exec() in a setup script is a classic indicator of malicious behavior, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. Additionally, the code imports system modules and performs path manipulations to write and execute files in temporary directories, which is consistent with malware techniques for persistence or payload delivery. The absence of legitimate application logic, the obfuscation, and the execution of hidden commands strongly indicate that this code is malicious."
