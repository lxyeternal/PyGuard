      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information including the hostname, IP address, and username without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this potentially sensitive information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (a non-standard domain under oastify.com, which is commonly used for testing or exfiltration). This pattern of environment discovery followed by immediate data exfiltration to an external, hardcoded endpoint is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, and the domain is not associated with any known benign service. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration and system fingerprinting."
