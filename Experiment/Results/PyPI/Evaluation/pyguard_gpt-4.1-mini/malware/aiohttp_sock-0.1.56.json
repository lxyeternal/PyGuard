      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with known malware patterns. Key malicious aspects include:\n\n1. The setup script forcibly installs additional packages via subprocess calls without user consent, which is suspicious in an installation context.\n\n2. It creates a hidden directory under the user's TEMP path named '__pycache__' and writes a base64-decoded Python script ('main.cpython-39.pyw') and a VBScript file ('main.scripts.cpython-39.vbs') into it. This is a common tactic to hide malicious payloads.\n\n3. The base64-decoded Python script contains obfuscated code that performs environment discovery (collecting hostname, user profile, platform, network info), decrypts data using Windows DPAPI, and exfiltrates sensitive information such as passwords and cookies to hardcoded suspicious external URLs (e.g., 'http://144.24.115.170', 'androidstore.devsecwise.com').\n\n4. The script enumerates browser data, including cookies, passwords, and other sensitive files, decrypts them, and sends them via HTTP POST requests to attacker-controlled endpoints.\n\n5. It uses asynchronous tasks and threading to perform stealthy background operations without user interaction.\n\n6. The VBScript file is executed immediately to run the Python script in a hidden manner, indicating an attempt to evade user detection.\n\n7. The code uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding, dynamic imports, and indirect function calls to hide its true intent.\n\n8. The presence of cryptographic decryption, environment fingerprinting, and network exfiltration combined with stealthy execution strongly confirms malicious intent.\n\nOverall, this code is a sophisticated malware sample designed for credential theft, environment reconnaissance, and data exfiltration, executed stealthily during package installation."
