      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. After running the standard install process, it collects detailed system information including hostname, current working directory, fully qualified domain name, IP address, reverse DNS lookup name, and the current username. It then sends this collected sensitive environment and user information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (https://cas54n1gfihn6082nil0kz451ubndy6rt.dooracle.in). This behavior is a classic example of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration embedded in a package installation script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The code executes this network communication without any user interaction, consent, or notification, and the external domain is non-standard and unrelated to any legitimate package repository or service. The use of a custom install command in setup.py to perform such data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, no error handling or logging, and no obfuscation to hide the intent, which further supports the conclusion that this code is designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate sensitive system information during package installation."
