      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of malware. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or ensure persistence. The PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com) to download or execute further code, which is unrelated to the stated purpose of the package. This execution occurs during the package setup process, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution on installation. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags to hide the window further confirms the intent to conceal malicious activity. Overall, these behaviors align with critical risk patterns for malware, including obfuscated remote code execution, stealth execution, and abuse of the package installation process."
