      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). This means arbitrary code execution occurs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution is a strong indicator of obfuscation and malicious intent. The code is embedded in the setup.py install hook, a known supply chain attack vector. The package metadata fields (name, author, description) are obfuscated and meaningless, further indicating an attempt to hide malicious behavior. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) in the install process, combined with execution of decrypted code, strongly suggests the package is designed to execute hidden malicious payloads on Windows systems during installation."
