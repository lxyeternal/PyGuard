      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This means arbitrary code is executed at install time without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during package installation strongly indicates malicious intent. The package setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this hidden payload execution. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators: arbitrary code execution during install, obfuscated and encrypted payload, execution without user consent, and use of network-related libraries for potential further malicious actions. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
