      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is likely a decoy or used to disguise the malicious payload within a package installation process, a known supply chain attack vector. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, with no legitimate application logic or user consent, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior."
