      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads or executes content from a suspicious URL (cdndiscardapp.com) that is unrelated to the stated purpose of the package. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running this command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or ensure a staging environment. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation, without user interaction or consent, embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, use of suspicious external URLs, and execution during package installation, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
