      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious Discord token and credential stealer with multiple advanced malicious behaviors. It performs the following malicious actions: 1) It checks the current username, hostname, and MAC address against blacklists to avoid running in certain environments, a common anti-analysis technique. 2) It forcibly kills any running Discord processes to interfere with normal operation. 3) It injects malicious JavaScript code into Discord client files (index.js) by downloading a remote script from a suspicious URL and replacing the original file, enabling persistent malicious code execution within Discord. 4) It searches for Discord tokens, browser passwords, and cookies by accessing local files and decrypting them using Windows DPAPI and AES, then exfiltrates this sensitive data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. 5) It collects detailed user environment information including IP address, username, badges, billing info, and friends list from Discord API using stolen tokens, and sends this data to the attacker-controlled webhook. 6) It uploads stolen data and files to anonymous file hosting services and reports the links to the attacker. 7) It copies itself to the Windows startup folder to achieve persistence on the victim machine. 8) It uses obfuscated and misleading function and variable names to hinder analysis. 9) It installs required packages dynamically without user consent. 10) It suppresses exceptions and runs many operations in background threads to evade detection. 11) The overall behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including credential theft, data exfiltration, persistence, process tampering, and remote code injection. This code is a fully featured information stealer and backdoor targeting Discord users and browsers, and is highly malicious."
