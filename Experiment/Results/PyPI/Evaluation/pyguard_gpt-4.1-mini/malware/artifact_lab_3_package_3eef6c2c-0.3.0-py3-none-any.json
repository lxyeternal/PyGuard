      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to retrieve an access token from the Google Compute Engine metadata service at the internal IP 169.254.169.254 without any user interaction or consent. This token is sensitive as it can grant access to Google Cloud resources. The code then immediately sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL hosted on an ngrok domain (https://cd1f-67-205-141-215.ngrok-free.app/log), which is a suspicious, non-standard domain often used for temporary or covert external access. This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns of malicious code, including unauthorized data exfiltration of sensitive credentials to an attacker-controlled server without user knowledge or legitimate application logic. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent evident, and the use of a metadata service token and hardcoded external endpoint for exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
