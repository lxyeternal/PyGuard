      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script that invokes a web request to a suspicious domain 'cdn.discordapp.com' to download and execute a file named 'Esquele.exe' in the user's Windows cache directory. This is done conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a staging or persistence check. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me') along with the suspicious URL and obfuscated execution strongly suggest malicious intent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection and error reporting. Overall, this code is designed to download and execute a potentially malicious payload covertly during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
