      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that invokes a web request to a suspicious GitHub raw URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and executes it silently without user consent or interaction. This behavior is triggered conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a staging or persistence mechanism. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The presence of this code in a setup script (setup.py) suggests it executes during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The domain and URL used are unrelated to the package's stated purpose and author, indicating malicious intent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection. Overall, this code downloads and executes a remote executable payload covertly during installation, which is a critical security risk and a hallmark of malware."
