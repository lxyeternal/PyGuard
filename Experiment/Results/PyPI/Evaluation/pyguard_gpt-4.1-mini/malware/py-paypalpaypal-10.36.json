      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) which appears to be a remote payload download and execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector to run malicious code upon installation without user consent. The package metadata uses suspicious author and email fields ('EsqueleSquad', 'tahgoficial@proton.me') and a misleading description unrelated to the actual behavior. The combination of obfuscated, hidden execution of a remote payload during installation, use of suspicious URLs, and suppression of exceptions strongly indicates malicious intent."
