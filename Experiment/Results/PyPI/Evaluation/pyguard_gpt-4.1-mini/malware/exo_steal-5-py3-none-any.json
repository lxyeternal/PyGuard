      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports everything from a module named 'exo-steal_file' using a relative import. The module name itself contains the word 'steal', which strongly suggests malicious intent related to unauthorized data access or exfiltration. The code also imports and initializes 'colorama', which is typically used for terminal color output, possibly to mask or prettify output of malicious actions. The use of a relative import from a suspiciously named module indicates that the malicious payload or behavior is hidden in that module, which is a common tactic to evade detection by separating malicious code into separate files. Given the suspicious module name and the import pattern, this code likely serves as a loader or initializer for malicious functionality, such as stealing files or data. Without the actual content of 'exo-steal_file', the import itself is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, especially considering the naming convention and the context of typical malware patterns. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It silently checks for the existence of specific directories and files related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet in the user's roaming appdata and desktop/downloads/documents folders. If found, it takes a screenshot of the user's screen and collects multiple sensitive wallet-related files (e.g., exodus.conf.json, passphrase.json, seed.seco, twofactor-secret.seco) by compressing them into a zip archive. It then gathers the victim's IP address and country code via external HTTP requests. The collected data, including the screenshot and the zip archive containing sensitive wallet files, is exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled Telegram bot via hardcoded bot token and chat ID using Telegram Bot API calls. The code suppresses exceptions to avoid detection and deletes the zip archive after sending, indicating anti-forensics behavior. There is no user interaction or consent, and the code operates stealthily to harvest and transmit sensitive credentials and wallet data, which can lead to theft of cryptocurrency assets. These actions align with multiple critical risk indicators such as environment discovery, data exfiltration to hardcoded external endpoints, use of sensitive user directories, and silent exception handling, confirming the code is malicious."
