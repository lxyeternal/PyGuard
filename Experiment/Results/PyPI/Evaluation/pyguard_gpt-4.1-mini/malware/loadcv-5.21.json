      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script. Such behavior is strongly indicative of malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation or import, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which serves as a disguise or delivery mechanism. The combination of hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands, lack of error handling, and embedding in setup code matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware."
