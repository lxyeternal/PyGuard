      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags to hide the window, indicating an attempt to run code without user awareness. The command is triggered conditionally if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests staging or evasion logic. The presence of a suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further supports malicious intent. The use of encoded PowerShell commands in a setup script is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands on Windows systems during package setup, which is a critical risk and hallmark of malware."
