      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that executes automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. It creates directories inside the Windows user's Start Menu Programs Startup folder and another folder named 'Powerpoint' in the same location, which is a known persistence mechanism to run code on system startup. It then clones two GitHub repositories into these directories, one presumably containing a Python script ('test.py') and the other containing an executable ('main.exe'). The script moves 'test.py' out of the cloned folder into the Startup folder to ensure it runs on startup. Finally, it immediately executes the downloaded executable 'main.exe' from the 'Powerpoint' folder. This sequence of actions—automatic cloning of remote repositories, placing files in startup folders for persistence, and immediate execution of a downloaded executable during package installation—is a classic pattern of malicious behavior, often used for persistence, remote code execution, and potential payload delivery. The code runs these actions silently during installation without user notification or validation, which is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack or malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
