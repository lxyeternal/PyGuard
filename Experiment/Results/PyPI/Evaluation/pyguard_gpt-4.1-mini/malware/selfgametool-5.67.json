      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution window. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is likely a decoy or used to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially supply chain attacks or post-installation payload execution, and is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
