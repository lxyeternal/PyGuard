      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and use of suspicious external references, all pointing to malicious intent."
