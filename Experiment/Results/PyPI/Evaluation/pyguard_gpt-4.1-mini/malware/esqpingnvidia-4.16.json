      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or analysis. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command is a known malware tactic to execute arbitrary code without user consent or interaction. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during package installation. The try-except blocks suppress all exceptions, which can hide failures and avoid detection. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including stealth execution, obfuscation, execution during package installation, and use of suspicious external domains."
