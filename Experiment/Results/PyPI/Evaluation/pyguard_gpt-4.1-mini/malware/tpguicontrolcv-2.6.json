      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common method to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade analysis or repeated infection. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution occurs during the setup script, meaning it triggers on package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy to disguise the malicious intent as a legitimate package. All these factors combined—hidden execution, encoded payload, conditional execution, suspicious domain/email, and execution during installation—are strong indicators of malicious intent."
