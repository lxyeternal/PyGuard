      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The presence of subprocess execution with hidden window style and encoded PowerShell command in a setup script is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with known malware patterns for stealthy payload delivery and execution during package installation."
