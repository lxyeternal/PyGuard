      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which decodes to a PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest command that silently downloads and executes an executable from a suspicious external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as ~\\WindowsCache.exe, then executes it. This behavior is typical of malware performing remote payload retrieval and execution without user consent or interaction. The code also suppresses all exceptions to avoid detection and runs this payload execution during the package setup process, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The presence of a suspicious domain (dropbox.com link with a direct executable), hidden execution, obfuscation via encoded commands, and execution during installation clearly indicate malicious intent."
