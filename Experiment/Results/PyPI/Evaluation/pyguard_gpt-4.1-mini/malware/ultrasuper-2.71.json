      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. This execution happens during the package setup process, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution in the setup script strongly indicates malicious intent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, and execution triggered during package installation."
