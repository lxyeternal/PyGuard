      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user consent or interaction, and is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, a known vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, likely to avoid detection or interruption. These factors combined—hidden execution, obfuscated payload, execution during package setup, and suppression of exceptions—are strong indicators of malicious intent."
