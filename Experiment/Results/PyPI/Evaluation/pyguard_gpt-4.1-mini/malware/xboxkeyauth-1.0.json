      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python snippet to a temporary file that imports urllib.request.urlopen to fetch and execute code directly from a hardcoded external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/m3qfu/raw) without any user interaction, validation, or consent. It then immediately executes this temporary file using a system shell command that launches a Python interpreter in windowed mode. This pattern—dynamic fetching and execution of remote code during package setup, writing and running temporary files, and use of os.system to spawn a new process—is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, often used in supply chain attacks or malware delivery. The external URL is suspicious and unrelated to the package's stated purpose, and the code executes arbitrary remote code at install time, which is a critical risk indicator for malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity and code execution, confirming the malicious intent."

It then immediately executes this temporary script using the Python interpreter in a new process via os.system with a 'start' command on Windows. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code without user consent, using temporary files, obfuscated imports and variable names, and immediate shell execution—is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The external URL is not a known trusted source, and the code lacks any error handling, logging, or user notification. This enables arbitrary remote code execution, which is a critical security risk and strongly indicative of malware."
