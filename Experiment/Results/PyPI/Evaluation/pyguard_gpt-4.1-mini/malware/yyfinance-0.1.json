      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It uses dynamic attribute access and character code manipulations to hide string literals, making analysis difficult. The code triggers on specific command-line arguments and performs complex, opaque computations to control execution flow. It imports modules like pip and win32com dynamically and attempts to create and write files in user directories, including expanding user home paths and creating directories with suspicious names. It uses Windows COM objects to create shortcuts and writes files with obfuscated names. The code checks for administrative privileges and performs actions conditionally, including writing and executing files, which is typical of malware persistence and payload deployment. The obfuscation, dynamic imports, file system manipulations in user directories, privilege checks, and execution of shell commands during package setup strongly indicate this code is designed for malicious purposes, likely as a supply chain attack or malware payload triggered during package installation."
