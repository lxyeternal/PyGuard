      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell, which is a classic malicious behavior. It creates a network socket that connects to a hardcoded external domain (6.tcp.eu.ngrok.io) on a specific port (13334) without any user interaction or consent. It then duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error (os.dup2 calls), effectively redirecting the shell's input/output to the remote connection. Finally, it spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i) that allows the remote server to execute arbitrary commands on the victim machine. This pattern is a hallmark of remote access trojans (RATs) and backdoors, enabling unauthorized remote control of the host system. There is no legitimate application logic, user notification, or authentication involved, and the use of a hardcoded external domain for connection further confirms the malicious intent."
