      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This means arbitrary code execution occurs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during install time is a classic supply chain attack vector. The package name 'web3.pyy' is suspicious and likely a typosquatting attempt. The setup script also specifies Windows as the target OS, and the encrypted payload likely contains further malicious code. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, use of cryptography to hide payload, and execution of decrypted code, all of which are hallmark signs of malware."
