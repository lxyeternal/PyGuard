      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then launches this hidden PowerShell process without user interaction or consent. This behavior is embedded in the setup script, which means it triggers during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command, combined with the hidden window style, strongly indicates an attempt to execute malicious code stealthily. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution during installation is a critical indicator of malicious intent."
