      "malicious_behavior": "The code reads potentially sensitive configuration files from user directories related to Minecraft and Lunar Client accounts, which likely contain user credentials or tokens. It then fetches a URL from a remote server by decoding a base64-encoded string and performing an HTTP GET request. This URL is used as a webhook endpoint to which the code immediately sends an HTTP POST request containing the contents of these sensitive files, without any user interaction or consent. The use of a Discord webhook URL (implied by the 'webhook_url' variable and typical Discord webhook usage pattern) for exfiltration is a common tactic in malware for stealthy data theft. The code exhibits multiple key indicators of malicious behavior: reading sensitive user data, obfuscated remote URL retrieval, and immediate exfiltration of data to an external endpoint without user knowledge. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification, and the pattern matches known data exfiltration malware behavior."
