      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command during the package setup process without user consent or interaction. Specifically, it checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then launches a PowerShell process with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and an '-EncodedCommand' parameter containing a base64-encoded payload. This pattern is a hallmark of stealthy, unauthorized code execution commonly used by malware to evade detection and perform malicious actions. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window. Embedding such obfuscated, hidden command execution in a setup script is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this behavior, making it highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent."
