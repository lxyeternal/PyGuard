      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-standard URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749497547150594048/Esquele.exe). This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and runs a remote payload without user consent or interaction. The code also checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or persistence tactic. The subprocess.Popen call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, this malicious execution is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden execution of a remote payload, use of suspicious URLs, and embedding in a setup script confirms this code is malicious."
