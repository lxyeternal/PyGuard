      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or sandboxed execution. This behavior is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, combined with the lack of user interaction, error handling, or transparency, strongly indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses all exceptions, which can be used to hide failures or detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including stealth execution, obfuscation, and execution during package installation."
