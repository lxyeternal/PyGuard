      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution in the install hook is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true payload from static analysis and executes potentially harmful code on the victim's machine during package installation. The obfuscated class name, meaningless description strings, and the conditional execution only on Windows further support the suspicion of malicious behavior. This pattern aligns with known supply chain attack vectors where malicious code is embedded in setup.py install hooks to execute arbitrary code stealthily."
