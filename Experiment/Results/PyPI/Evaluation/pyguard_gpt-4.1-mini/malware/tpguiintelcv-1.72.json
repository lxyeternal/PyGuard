      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads or executes content from a suspicious URL (cdndiscardapp.com) unrelated to the stated package purpose. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory ('tahg') before executing the payload, indicating conditional execution to evade detection or analysis. This execution happens during the package setup process, which is a common supply chain attack vector to run malicious code upon installation without user consent. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the setup code appears to be a decoy, with legitimate-looking metadata but no actual benign logic to justify the network or shell execution. The combination of obfuscated, hidden execution of external code during installation, use of suspicious URLs, and suppression of errors strongly classifies this code as malicious."
