      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a subprocess command during the package setup process that uses PowerShell to download an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mkd3enun97s8zag/Oxzy.exe?dl=0) and saves it to the user's home directory as 'WindowsCache.exe'. It then immediately executes this downloaded file via Invoke-Expression. This behavior is a classic indicator of malicious activity: it performs remote payload retrieval and execution without user consent or notification, embedded directly in the installation script. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses the console window, increasing stealth. The code also attempts to import subprocess dynamically and installs it if missing, which is unusual and suspicious. The overall pattern matches a supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code is executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. Therefore, this code is malicious."
