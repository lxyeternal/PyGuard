      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable binary from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://github-bebra.s3.filebase.com/node) without any user interaction or validation, writes it to a temporary directory (/tmp/node), and then executes it with elevated permissions (chmod +x and ./node). It also writes a configuration file (.gitler) with settings that appear to configure a cryptocurrency mining operation (e.g., 'mode': 'nicehash', 'pools' with an IP address and port). The execution of this downloaded binary is done silently during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a non-standard domain, direct execution of downloaded code, lack of user consent, and the mining configuration strongly indicate malicious intent, likely unauthorized cryptocurrency mining (cryptojacking). This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as remote payload retrieval, writing and executing files in temporary directories, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and execution during package installation without user consent."
