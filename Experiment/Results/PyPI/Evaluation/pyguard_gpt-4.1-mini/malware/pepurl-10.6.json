      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens immediately upon import or setup, without user interaction or consent, embedded in a setup script context, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command in this manner is suspicious and typical of malware attempting to run hidden payloads. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses all exceptions, which can hide errors and further evade detection. Overall, the presence of hidden, encoded PowerShell execution triggered during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
