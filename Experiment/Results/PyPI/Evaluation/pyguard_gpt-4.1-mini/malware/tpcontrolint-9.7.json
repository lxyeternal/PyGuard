      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. This execution occurs during the setup script, which means it triggers on package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess to run hidden PowerShell with encoded commands, combined with obfuscation and silent exception handling, strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at executing unauthorized code stealthily on Windows systems."
