      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. This execution happens silently without user consent or notification, and the subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden, encoded PowerShell execution in the setup script strongly suggests a supply chain attack vector or malicious payload delivery during package installation. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup, all of which are hallmark signs of malware."
