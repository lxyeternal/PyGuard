      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags to hide the window, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The command is executed conditionally if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting staging or persistence behavior. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package. The setup() call uses a generic and misleading package name ('tpmaskpaypalping') and package description that does not match the actual behavior, which is a common tactic in malicious packages to disguise intent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, use of suspicious domain/email, and lack of legitimate application logic strongly indicates this code is malicious."
