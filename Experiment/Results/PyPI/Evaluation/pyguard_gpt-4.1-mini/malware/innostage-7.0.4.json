      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically constructs a URL using the local hostname and performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain ('http://files.inostage.ru/version/check/' + hostname). The response text from this request is executed directly via exec(), which allows arbitrary code execution fetched from a remote server without any validation, user consent, or sandboxing. This behavior is a critical red flag and a hallmark of malicious activity, as it enables remote code execution during package installation (setup.py), a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of exec() on network-fetched data combined with the absence of error handling or user notification strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary remote code execution, dynamic code loading from untrusted sources, and execution during package installation, which can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further payload delivery."

It then executes the exact content of the response using exec() without any validation or user consent. This pattern is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior because it enables arbitrary remote code execution from an untrusted source. The absence of error handling, user interaction, or legitimate application logic around this network and execution activity further supports the conclusion that this code is designed to fetch and run potentially harmful code remotely, which is a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks."
