      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation, without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which serves as a disguise to hide the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation process. These characteristics align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including stealth execution, obfuscation, execution during package installation, and lack of error handling to avoid detection."
