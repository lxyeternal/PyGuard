      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to legitimate Python packages. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command is a common malware pattern to execute arbitrary code stealthily. Additionally, the malicious code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known supply chain attack vector to execute code during package installation without user consent. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, this code exhibits multiple high-risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, suspicious directory checks, and embedding malicious execution in a package setup script, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
