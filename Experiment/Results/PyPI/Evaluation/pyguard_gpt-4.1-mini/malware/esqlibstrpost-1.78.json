      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user consent or interaction and suppresses exceptions silently. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The presence of this execution within a setup script (commonly run during package installation) suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes automatically during installation. The author and email fields appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate packages. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, silent exception handling, and suspicious directory checks strongly indicates malicious intent."
