      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to hide the actual command content. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest suspicious origins. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup or installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as execution of obfuscated shell commands in hidden windows, execution triggered during package setup, and lack of user consent or notification. Therefore, this code is malicious."
