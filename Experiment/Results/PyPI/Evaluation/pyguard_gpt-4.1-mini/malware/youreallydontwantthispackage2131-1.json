      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools commands that execute a shell command during package installation, development setup, or egg info generation without user interaction or consent. The shell command fetches an access token from the Google Cloud metadata service (a sensitive credential endpoint) and immediately sends it via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL hosted on an ngrok-free.app domain, which is commonly used for tunneling and can be attacker-controlled. This behavior constitutes unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive credentials during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of os.system to run shell commands in setup hooks, combined with network exfiltration of sensitive tokens to a non-standard, suspicious domain, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying this behavior, and the code is embedded in the package installation process, which is a known malware delivery technique."
