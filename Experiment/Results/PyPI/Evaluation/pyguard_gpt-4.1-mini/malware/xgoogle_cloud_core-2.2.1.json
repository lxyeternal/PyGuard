      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and a suspicious package name, then encodes this data in base64 and further hex-encodes it. It constructs domain names by appending this encoded data as subdomains to a suspicious DNS domain ('.sub.deliverycontent.online') and performs ping commands to these domains, which is a covert channel technique often used for data exfiltration via DNS queries. Additionally, it sends the encoded data via HTTP POST and GET requests to a hardcoded, non-standard, suspicious external domain ('www.deliverycontent.online') using multiple methods (urllib.request, requests, urllib), all without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hex encoding), hardcoded suspicious domains, automated network communication with no legitimate application logic, and exfiltration of system/user information are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including environment fingerprinting, covert data exfiltration, and communication with attacker-controlled infrastructure."
