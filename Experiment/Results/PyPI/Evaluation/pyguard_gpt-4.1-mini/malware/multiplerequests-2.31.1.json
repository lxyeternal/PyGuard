      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded within a setuptools setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. After the standard package setup call, it performs a network request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://frvezdffvv.pythonanywhere.com/getpackage) that is unrelated to the package's stated purpose. The response content is directly used as a base64-encoded payload, which is written into a Python script file in the user's roaming AppData directory—a sensitive user-specific location often abused for persistence. The script then immediately executes this file in a hidden subprocess without any user consent, validation, or integrity checks. This sequence—downloading obfuscated code from an untrusted source, writing it to disk in a hidden location, and executing it silently—is a classic pattern of remote code execution and payload delivery used by malware. The absence of error handling, user notification, or legitimate application logic around these actions further confirms the malicious intent. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
