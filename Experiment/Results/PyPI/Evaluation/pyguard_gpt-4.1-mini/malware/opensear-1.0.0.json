      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing arbitrary, obfuscated code at install time without user consent or interaction, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector. Additionally, the package setup specifies dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests' which are used solely for this hidden payload execution. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description further suggest an attempt to hide malicious activity. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution during install, use of encrypted payloads, dynamic imports, and execution without user awareness, confirming it is malicious."
