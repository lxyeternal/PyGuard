      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) which is unrelated to the stated package purpose and is likely used to download or execute a malicious payload. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution occurs during the package setup process without user consent or interaction, indicating a supply chain attack vector. The presence of the suspicious author name and email, along with the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip', further supports malicious intent. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is used as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute a hidden PowerShell command that likely downloads and runs malware, making it malicious."
