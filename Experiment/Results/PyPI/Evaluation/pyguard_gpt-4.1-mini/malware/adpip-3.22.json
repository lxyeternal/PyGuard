      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script. The setup() call itself is benign, but the presence of hidden, encoded PowerShell execution triggered conditionally in the same script is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern aligns with critical risk indicators such as executing obfuscated shell commands in hidden windows during package installation or setup, a known supply chain attack vector."
