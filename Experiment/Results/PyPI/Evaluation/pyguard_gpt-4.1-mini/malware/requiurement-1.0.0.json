      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which executes arbitrary code during package installation without user consent. Specifically, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and immediately executes it with exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a classic supply chain attack vector enabling arbitrary code execution. The obfuscated class name and encrypted payload hide the true intent, and the use of network libraries suggests potential for further malicious network activity. The package name 'requiurement' is a likely typo-squatting attempt to mimic legitimate packages. The code triggers execution during installation, which is a critical risk pattern associated exclusively with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
