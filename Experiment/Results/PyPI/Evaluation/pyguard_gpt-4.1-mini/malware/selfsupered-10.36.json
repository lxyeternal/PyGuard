      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. This execution occurs during the setup script, meaning it triggers on package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command with encoded payload and hidden window style is a hallmark of stealthy malware execution. No legitimate application logic justifies this behavior, and the rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy or cover. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands on the victim's machine during package installation."
