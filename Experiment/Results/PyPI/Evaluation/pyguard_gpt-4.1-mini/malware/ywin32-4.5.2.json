      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: it hooks into the package installation process via a custom install command subclass, which triggers execution of the 'send' function immediately upon installation without user consent. The 'send' function collects the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' (system-specific information) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', which is unrelated to any legitimate Python package repository or service. Furthermore, if the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable file from another suspicious URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', saves it with a suspicious filename 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and immediately executes it using 'os.system' with the 'start' command, which launches the executable without user interaction or validation. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection or error reporting. This pattern of environment fingerprinting, data exfiltration, downloading and executing an untrusted executable during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. The use of hardcoded, non-standard URLs, execution of downloaded code without validation, and execution triggered during installation without user consent confirms the code is malicious."
