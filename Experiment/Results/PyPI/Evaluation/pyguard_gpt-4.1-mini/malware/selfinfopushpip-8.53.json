      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that invokes a web request to a suspicious GitHub raw URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden window. This behavior is consistent with downloading and executing a remote payload without user consent or interaction, a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The malicious code is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which can trigger execution during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command string is suspicious and likely to spawn a hidden process. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated remote payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
