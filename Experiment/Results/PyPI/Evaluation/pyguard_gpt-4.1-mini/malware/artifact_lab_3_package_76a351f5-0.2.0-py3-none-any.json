      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell, which is a classic and highly reliable indicator of malicious behavior. Specifically, it creates a TCP socket and connects to a hardcoded external domain (6.tcp.ngrok.io) on a specific port. It then duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error (os.dup2 calls), effectively redirecting the shell's input/output to the remote connection. Finally, it spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i) connected to this socket. This allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine without user interaction or consent. The immediate execution of the reverse_shell() function upon script run, the use of a hardcoded external address, and the spawning of a shell process over the network are all hallmark signs of a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction to justify this behavior, making it unequivocally malicious."
