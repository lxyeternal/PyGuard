      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or repeated execution. This behavior is embedded in the setup script, which means it triggers during package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command, combined with suppression of all exceptions (try-except pass), further indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Based on the provided knowledge points, this pattern is a critical risk indicator of malware, specifically stealthy code execution during package installation without user consent."
