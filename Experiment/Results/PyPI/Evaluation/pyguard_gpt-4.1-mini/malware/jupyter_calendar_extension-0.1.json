      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to run code during package installation without user consent. It enumerates files under a suspicious hardcoded directory (/Users/Shared/C*/*r*/2*/*) and uses a cryptographic generator to check for a specific byte pattern (VAR1). Upon a match, it downloads an obfuscated payload from dynamically decoded URLs (VAR2 and VAR3 XORed with generated streams) that depend on the system architecture. The downloaded content is XOR-decrypted with a generated keystream and saved as an executable binary named 'jupyter_calendar' in the user's ~/.local/bin directory, a common location for user executables. The binary is then made executable and launched silently via subprocess.Popen with stdout and stderr redirected to DEVNULL, indicating stealth execution. The code uses obfuscation techniques (multiple XOR streams seeded by hashed strings and paths) to hide the URLs and payload, which is a classic evasion tactic. The URLs are not standard or documented package sources, and the code performs no validation or user notification before downloading and executing remote code. The creation of a suspicious empty file in /tmp with a GUID-like name further suggests staging or persistence mechanisms. These behaviors—code execution during install, obfuscated remote payload retrieval, writing and executing binaries in user directories, and silent process spawning—are hallmark indicators of malicious supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
