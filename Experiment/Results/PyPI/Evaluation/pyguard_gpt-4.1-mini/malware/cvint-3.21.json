      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure persistence. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is likely a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. The combination of hidden PowerShell execution, encoded commands, conditional directory checks, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attack vectors or malware delivery mechanisms."
