      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive user data. It collects Discord tokens from various local storage paths, decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI, and extracts user information such as email, phone, badges, billing info, and friends list via Discord API calls using stolen tokens. The code then exfiltrates this sensitive information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. It also searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files and folders with keywords related to accounts, passwords, and secrets, uploads them to anonymous file hosting services, and reports the findings. The code uses obfuscated function and variable names, suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, and employs threading to perform concurrent data collection and exfiltration. It kills processes of targeted applications to access locked files, zips sensitive data, uploads it, and sends detailed reports to the attacker-controlled webhook. The presence of hardcoded external webhook URL, use of Windows DPAPI decryption to steal credentials, extraction of Discord tokens, and automated exfiltration of sensitive data without user consent are definitive indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
