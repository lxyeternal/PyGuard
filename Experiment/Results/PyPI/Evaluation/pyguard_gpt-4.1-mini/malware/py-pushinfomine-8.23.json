      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) without user consent or interaction. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector to run arbitrary code on installation. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The domain and file being downloaded are unrelated to the stated package purpose and author, and the overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload delivery, hidden execution, and unsolicited network activity. Therefore, this code is malicious."
