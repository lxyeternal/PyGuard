      "malicious_behavior": "The code fetches a list of executables from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt) without any user interaction or consent. It filters the list based on the current operating system, downloads each executable from the same suspicious IP, writes them directly to disk, sets executable permissions on Unix-like systems, and immediately executes them in the background. This pattern of downloading and executing arbitrary binaries from a hardcoded external IP address without validation or user notification is a classic hallmark of malware. The code also hooks into all HTTP method functions (get, post, put, patch, delete, head, options, request) to run this payload execution function before performing the actual HTTP request, indicating an attempt to hide malicious behavior behind seemingly normal network operations. There is no legitimate application logic, error handling, or user consent, and the use of a raw IP address rather than a domain name further increases suspicion. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators such as remote payload retrieval, unsupervised execution of downloaded code, lack of validation, and execution in non-interactive contexts, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
