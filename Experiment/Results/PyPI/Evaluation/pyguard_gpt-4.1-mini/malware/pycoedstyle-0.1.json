      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated string construction and variable names to hide its intent. The code conditionally imports modules like 'pip' and 'win32com', attempts to create and write files in user directories, and manipulates Windows shortcuts via COM objects. It performs environment checks, including administrative privilege detection, and creates directories and files with obfuscated paths. The code also walks through directories, searches for specific file extensions, and creates shortcuts with arguments that appear to be obfuscated commands. The presence of obfuscated control flow with large numeric constants controlling loops and conditions, combined with dynamic imports and file system manipulation in a setup script, strongly suggests a supply chain attack or post-installation payload delivery. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as persistence setup, payload deployment, and stealthy execution triggered during package installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
