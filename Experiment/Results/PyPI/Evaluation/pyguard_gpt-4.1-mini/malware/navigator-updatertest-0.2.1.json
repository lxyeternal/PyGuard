      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class (CustomInstall) that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. After running the standard install process, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (https://ccqvib15v50h42949ip0kzxgeyonaaege.oast.pro). This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns: it executes network communication during package installation without user consent, exfiltrates potentially sensitive system information (hostname, cwd, username) to an attacker-controlled server, uses a hardcoded suspicious URL unrelated to the package purpose, and embeds this in the install hook, which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data exfiltration. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent and is commonly associated with malware performing environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration during package installation."
