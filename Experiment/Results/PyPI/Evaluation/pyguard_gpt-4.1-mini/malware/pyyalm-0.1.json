      "malicious_behavior": "The code is malicious because it abuses the package installation process (setup.py) to perform unauthorized modifications on the victim's Windows system. Specifically, during the 'bdist_wheel' or 'install' commands, it writes an obfuscated JavaScript background script and a manifest.json file into a hidden directory under the user's APPDATA path, effectively creating a Chrome extension without user consent. It then enumerates shortcut (.lnk) files in critical user and system startup locations (Start Menu, TaskBar pinned items, Desktop, and ProgramData Start Menu if running as admin) and modifies shortcuts for popular browsers (chrome.exe, msedge.exe, brave.exe, launcher.exe) to add a command-line argument that loads the malicious extension. This behavior is a classic persistence and injection technique to silently load malicious code into browsers on system startup or launch. The JavaScript code itself is obfuscated and runs a function every second that manipulates clipboard content, replacing certain cryptocurrency address patterns with attacker-controlled addresses, indicating clipboard hijacking for financial theft. The code also silently installs the 'pypiwin32' package if missing, suppresses exceptions, and performs all actions without user interaction or notification. These actions match multiple critical risk indicators such as: execution of code during package installation, writing obfuscated payloads to user directories, modifying startup shortcuts for persistence, clipboard hijacking, obfuscation of payload, and lack of user consent or transparency. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to persistently hijack browser behavior and steal cryptocurrency by replacing clipboard data."
