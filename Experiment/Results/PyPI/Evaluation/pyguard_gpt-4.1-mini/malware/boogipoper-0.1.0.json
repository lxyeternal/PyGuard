      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that executes a shell command during the package installation process without user interaction or consent. Specifically, it runs a reverse shell command using bash to connect back to a hardcoded external IP address (114.116.119.253) on port 7777. This behavior is a classic indicator of a remote access trojan (RAT) or reverse shell payload, enabling unauthorized remote control of the victim's system. The execution of this command during installation is a known supply chain attack vector, allowing attackers to gain remote code execution on the victim machine immediately upon installing the package. The use of a hardcoded IP address, lack of user notification, and execution in the install hook all strongly indicate malicious intent."
