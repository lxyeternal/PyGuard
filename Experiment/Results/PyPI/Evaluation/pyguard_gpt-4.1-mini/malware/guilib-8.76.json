      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation. These characteristics align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including stealth execution, obfuscation, execution during package installation, and lack of transparency or user notification."
