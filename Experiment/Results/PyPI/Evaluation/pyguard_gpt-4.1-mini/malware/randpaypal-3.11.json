      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this hidden command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in a setup script context, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The setup call itself appears benign but is used as a cover for the malicious payload execution. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command, combined with suppression of all exceptions, further indicates an attempt to evade detection and silently execute malicious code. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including stealth execution, obfuscation, and execution during package installation."
