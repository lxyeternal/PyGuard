      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It fetches a list of executables from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt) without any user interaction or consent. It then downloads these executables from the same IP and writes them directly to disk. After saving, it sets executable permissions (on Linux/macOS) and immediately executes these downloaded files in the background using shell commands (os.system). This pattern of network retrieval of executables from a hardcoded external IP, writing them to disk, and executing them without validation or user notification is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The code also hooks into all HTTP request methods (get, post, put, patch, delete, head, options, request) to call this execute() function, ensuring the payload download and execution happens as a side effect of any network request made through this module, which is a stealthy persistence and execution technique. There is no legitimate application logic, error handling, or user consent, and the external IP is not a known trusted domain. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is designed to download and run potentially malicious payloads remotely, making it malicious."
