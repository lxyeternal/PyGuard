      "malicious_behavior": "The code reads potentially sensitive configuration files from user directories related to Minecraft and Lunar Client accounts, which likely contain user credentials or tokens. It then fetches a URL from a remote server by decoding a base64-encoded string and performing an HTTP GET request. This URL is used as a webhook endpoint to which the code immediately sends an HTTP POST request containing the contents of these sensitive files. The use of base64 encoding to hide the initial URL, the targeting of user-specific configuration files without user consent or interaction, and the immediate exfiltration of this data to an external webhook are strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern matches known malware behavior involving credential theft and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints."
