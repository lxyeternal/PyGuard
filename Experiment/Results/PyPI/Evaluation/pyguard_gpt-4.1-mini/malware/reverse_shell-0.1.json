      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell that connects to a hardcoded IP address (localhost) on port 4444 and waits for commands from the remote server. It executes received commands on the local system using subprocess.Popen with shell=True, capturing both stdout and stderr, and sends the output back to the remote server. This behavior enables an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary shell commands on the victim machine without user interaction or consent. The immediate spawning of a shell process after establishing a network connection, combined with continuous command execution and data exfiltration over a socket, is a classic hallmark of remote access trojans (RATs) or reverse shell malware. There is no legitimate application logic, user notification, or authentication, and the code lacks error handling or logging, further indicating malicious intent."
