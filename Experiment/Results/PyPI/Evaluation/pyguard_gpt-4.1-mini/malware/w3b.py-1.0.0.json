      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). This means arbitrary code execution occurs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution in the install hook is a classic supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code also requires 'fernet' and 'requests' packages, which are used only in the malicious install hook. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators: execution of decrypted code at install time, obfuscation, no user notification, and arbitrary code execution from an encrypted payload. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to execute hidden malicious payloads during package installation on Windows systems."
