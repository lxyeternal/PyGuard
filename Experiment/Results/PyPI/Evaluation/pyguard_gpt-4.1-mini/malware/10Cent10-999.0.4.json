      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class (CustomInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it creates a TCP socket and connects to a hardcoded external IP address (104.248.19.57) on port 3333. It then duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error (os.dup2 calls), effectively redirecting the shell's input/output to the socket. Finally, it spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh) connected to this socket. This behavior is a classic reverse shell implementation, allowing an attacker to remotely execute commands on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. Embedding such code in a package's install script is a known supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution during package installation. The use of hardcoded IP, socket redirection, and spawning a shell during install time are all strong indicators of malicious intent."
