      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a setuptools setup script that subclasses the install command to execute additional code during package installation without user consent. Specifically, the function 'notmalfunc' decodes a base64-encoded string ('ZWNobyBob2xhIHF1ZSB0YWwgPiB0cnVlLnhtbAo=') which translates to the shell command 'echo hola que tal > true.xml\\n'. This command writes the text 'hola que tal' into a file named 'true.xml' in the current directory. The command is executed via os.system during the install phase (AfterInstall.run). Executing shell commands during package installation without explicit user interaction or notification is a known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. Although the payload here is relatively benign (writing a file), the pattern of base64 decoding and executing shell commands in install hooks is a hallmark of malware delivery and execution. This behavior can be easily extended or modified to execute arbitrary commands or payloads, making it a critical risk. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
