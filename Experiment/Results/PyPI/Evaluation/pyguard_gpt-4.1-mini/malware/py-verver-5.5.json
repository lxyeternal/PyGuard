      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It conditionally executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting a staging or persistence check. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the legitimate purpose of the setup script. The setup() call appears benign but is used here likely as a cover or to facilitate installation. The presence of subprocess execution with hidden window style and encoded commands in a setup script is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated payload during installation without user consent, which is a critical indicator of malicious intent."
