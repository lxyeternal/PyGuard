      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens silently without user consent or interaction, and the use of hidden PowerShell with encoded commands is a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the setup() call appears benign but is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, which may be used to hide failures. Overall, the presence of hidden, encoded PowerShell execution triggered during package setup or import is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attack vectors or malware delivery mechanisms."
