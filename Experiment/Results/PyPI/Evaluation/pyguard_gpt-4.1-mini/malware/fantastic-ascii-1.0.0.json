      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses the setuptools install command to register a post-install function (_post_install) that executes automatically after installation without user consent. This function collects sensitive environment information including the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (via os.uname()[1]), and the current file path. It then encodes this information in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain (https://kotko.org) with a query parameter constructed from the company and package name concatenated with the encoded data. This behavior is a classic example of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The code also writes a local file ('pocbykotko.txt') with a benign-looking string, likely to mark execution or evade detection. The network communication is unsolicited, without user interaction or notification, and targets a non-standard, suspicious domain unrelated to the package's stated purpose. The use of base64 encoding for the transmitted data is a common obfuscation tactic to evade detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including execution of network communication during install, exfiltration of system information, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and lack of user consent or transparency."
