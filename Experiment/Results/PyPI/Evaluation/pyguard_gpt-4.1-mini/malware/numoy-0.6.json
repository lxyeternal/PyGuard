      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It embeds network communication in a post-install hook of a Python package setup script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Specifically, during package installation, it collects detailed system information including OS details and the machine's IP address, then opens a raw TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 9090 and sends this information without any user interaction or consent. This unsolicited exfiltration of system fingerprinting data to a suspicious hardcoded IP is a classic hallmark of malware. The use of a post-install command subclass to trigger this behavior during installation further confirms the intent to execute code stealthily as part of the package installation process, which is a common malicious tactic. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, and the external IP is not associated with any known benign service. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to perform unauthorized data exfiltration during package installation."
