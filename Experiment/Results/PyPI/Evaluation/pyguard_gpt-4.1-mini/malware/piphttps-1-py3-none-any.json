      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a Discord token stealer and exfiltrator. It searches for Discord and various Chromium-based browser local storage paths on a Windows system, extracts encrypted Discord tokens, decrypts them using Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData), and validates them by querying Discord's API. Upon successful validation, it collects sensitive user information including username, user ID, email, phone number, 2FA status, Nitro subscription details, and system information such as IP address, PC username, and PC name. It then formats this data into a message and sends it to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating sensitive credentials and system data to an attacker-controlled endpoint. The code operates without user consent or interaction, uses cryptographic decryption to access protected tokens, and performs network communication to an external webhook for data exfiltration. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators of malicious code, including credential theft, unauthorized data exfiltration, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and absence of legitimate application logic. Therefore, this code is malicious."
