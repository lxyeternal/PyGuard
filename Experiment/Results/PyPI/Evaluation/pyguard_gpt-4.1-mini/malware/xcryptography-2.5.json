      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including hostname, username, package name, and current working directory, encodes this data in base64, then further encodes it in hex and sends it covertly via DNS queries (using ping commands to crafted subdomains) to a suspicious domain '.sub.deliverycontent.online'. It also sends the same encoded data via HTTP POST and GET requests to 'www.deliverycontent.online' using multiple methods (urllib.request, requests, urllib). The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and unrelated to any legitimate Python package or service. The code performs these network communications without any user interaction or consent, suppresses all exceptions to avoid detection, and uses obfuscation techniques (base64 encoding, hex encoding, randomization) to hide the data exfiltration process. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with covert DNS exfiltration and HTTP data transmission to hardcoded suspicious domains is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically information stealing or staging malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven action justifying these operations. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to stealthily exfiltrate system information to an attacker-controlled server."
