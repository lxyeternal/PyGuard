      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the package name, current user login, hostname, platform details, current working directory, and the local IP address obtained via a socket connection to an external DNS server (8.8.8.8). It then encodes this information in Base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://162.62.15.24/v/<base64_data>). This behavior is consistent with system fingerprinting and data exfiltration. Furthermore, this network communication occurs in the global scope of a setup script, meaning it executes automatically during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded IP address rather than a domain name, the encoding of sensitive environment and system data, and the immediate outbound network request without any legitimate application logic or user notification strongly indicate malicious intent. Although the setup() call itself appears benign, the side effect of environment data exfiltration during installation classifies this code as malicious."
