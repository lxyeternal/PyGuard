      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom installation command class (PostInstallCommand) that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation without user consent. This code collects sensitive environment information including the current username (os.getlogin()), the hostname (os.uname()[1]), and the current working directory (os.getcwd()), encodes these values in base64, and sends them via HTTP GET requests to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (https://bfad8061.pwnie.me). The domain name is non-standard and unrelated to any legitimate package or service, indicating potential data exfiltration. Furthermore, the code executes a shell command using os.system to run 'curl' to fetch content from another suspicious URL (https://vulnerable.bfad8061.pwnie.me) without validation or user notification, which could lead to remote code execution or further payload delivery. All network and shell operations suppress exceptions silently, which is a common evasion technique. The embedding of this behavior in the package's setup.py install hook is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation. Collectively, these factors—unsolicited environment data collection and exfiltration, execution of remote commands, use of suspicious hardcoded URLs, and execution triggered during installation—are hallmark signs of malicious intent."
