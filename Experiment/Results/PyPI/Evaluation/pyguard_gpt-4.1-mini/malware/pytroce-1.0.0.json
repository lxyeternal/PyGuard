      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of encrypted payload and exec() to run decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true payload from static analysis. Additionally, the package setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook, further indicating that these dependencies are for malicious purposes. The obfuscated class name and nonsensical description strings also suggest an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators: execution of encrypted code at install time, use of dynamic code execution (exec), obfuscation, and conditional execution only on Windows systems, all consistent with malicious behavior."
