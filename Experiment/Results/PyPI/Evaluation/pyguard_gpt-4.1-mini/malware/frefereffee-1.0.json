      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a highly sophisticated and comprehensive information stealer malware. It is embedded in the install process of a Python package via setuptools post-install hook, which triggers execution upon package installation without user consent. The code performs extensive system reconnaissance, including gathering system info, installed antivirus, task list, clipboard content, and network info. It steals sensitive data such as browser passwords, cookies, history, autofills, Discord tokens, Telegram sessions, Minecraft, Steam, Epic, Uplay, Growtopia game sessions, Roblox cookies, crypto wallets, WiFi passwords, and common user files. It captures webcam images and screenshots stealthily. The malware uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding, zlib compression, and dynamic code execution (eval/exec) to hide its payload and evade detection. It disables Windows Defender and excludes itself from scanning. It attempts privilege escalation via UAC bypass techniques and persistence by copying itself to startup folders. It injects malicious JavaScript code into Discord client files to maintain backdoor access. The stolen data and system information are archived (with password protection) and exfiltrated to attacker-controlled servers via Discord webhooks or Telegram bots, including uploading large archives to external file hosting services. The code suppresses errors and logging to avoid detection. It uses hardcoded suspicious URLs and domains unrelated to legitimate software. The entire behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators and known malware patterns, including supply chain attack vectors, credential theft, data exfiltration, stealth execution, and persistence mechanisms. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to compromise victim systems and steal sensitive information."
