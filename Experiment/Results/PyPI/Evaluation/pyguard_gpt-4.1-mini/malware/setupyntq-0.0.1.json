      "malicious_behavior": "The code is base64-decoded and then executed dynamically via exec and compile, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation and malicious intent. The decoded payload imports modules for temporary file handling, system execution, and URL opening, then writes and executes code fetched from hardcoded suspicious IP addresses (http://20.226.18.203:1337/...). It performs network requests to these hardcoded IPs without user interaction or consent, writes temporary files, executes them, and attempts to replace '.exe' extensions with 'w.exe' in system calls, indicating attempts to run or hide executables. The use of obfuscated imports (__import__), base64 encoding, hardcoded external IP addresses, dynamic code execution, and network communication to suspicious endpoints are all classic hallmarks of malware. This code likely downloads and executes remote payloads, potentially establishing persistence or exfiltrating data, and does so without any legitimate application logic or user consent."
