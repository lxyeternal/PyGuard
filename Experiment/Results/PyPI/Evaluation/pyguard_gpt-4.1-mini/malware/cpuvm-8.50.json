      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. This execution happens immediately upon import or execution of the script, without user consent or interaction, and is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden, encoded PowerShell execution alongside it strongly indicates malicious intent. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command with encoded payload and hidden window style is a hallmark of malware attempting to execute further payloads or perform unauthorized actions stealthily."
