      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to stealthily collect sensitive user data, specifically Discord authentication tokens and Roblox security cookies, by accessing local application data directories and decrypting stored credentials using Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData). It then exfiltrates this sensitive information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://matched-anthem.000webhostapp.com/'), which is not associated with any legitimate service. The code performs this data collection and exfiltration without any user interaction or consent. It also includes obfuscated token extraction patterns and uses cryptographic decryption to access protected data, which is a hallmark of credential theft malware. The presence of multiple imports related to browser cookie extraction, cryptography, and subprocess management, combined with the silent installation of dependencies and repeated clearing of the console, further supports the intent to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to steal sensitive authentication credentials and send them to an attacker-controlled server, which is a classic malicious behavior pattern."
