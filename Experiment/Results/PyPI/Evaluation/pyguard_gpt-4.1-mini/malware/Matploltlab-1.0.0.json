      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload and immediately executes it with exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The payload is encrypted and obfuscated, hiding its true intent, and the use of exec() on decrypted data is a critical red flag for malicious activity. The package name 'Matploltlab' is a typo-squatting attempt mimicking the legitimate 'matplotlib' package, which is a known tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The setup script also specifies dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code exhibits multiple high-risk indicators: obfuscated payload, execution at install time, use of cryptography to hide payload, and no legitimate application logic, confirming it is malicious."
