      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command during the package installation process without user interaction or consent. Specifically, the function post_install() calls os.system() to run a bash reverse shell command that connects to a hardcoded external IP address (81.46.246.181) on port 4444. This command attempts to open an interactive bash shell redirected over a TCP connection, effectively creating a remote shell backdoor. This behavior is a classic indicator of malicious intent, as it enables unauthorized remote control of the victim's system immediately upon package installation. The use of a hardcoded IP address, execution of shell commands in a setup script, and lack of any legitimate application logic or user notification further confirm the malicious nature of this code."
