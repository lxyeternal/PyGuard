      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package. The setup() call appears to be a decoy to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installation script, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The subprocess call runs without user consent or interaction, in a hidden window, and executes an encoded command that likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads. The use of try-except blocks suppresses any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including stealthy execution, obfuscation, conditional payload execution, and abuse of the package installation process."
