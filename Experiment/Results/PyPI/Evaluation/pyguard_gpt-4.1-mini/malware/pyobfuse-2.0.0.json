      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It contains heavy obfuscation, including the use of zlib-compressed and encoded byte strings passed to functions named 'Power' and 'Ceil' that write to globals and execute code dynamically. The code uses exec on decompressed data, which is a critical red flag for arbitrary code execution. There are dynamic imports and eval calls on obfuscated strings reconstructed from integer-to-character conversions, which is a classic code injection technique. The code is embedded within a setuptools setup script, which can trigger execution during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of hardcoded Discord and GitHub URLs alongside obfuscated payloads suggests command-and-control or payload delivery mechanisms. The code suppresses exceptions and uses misleading class and function names to hide intent. Overall, the combination of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, execution during installation, and encoded payloads strongly indicates malicious intent."
