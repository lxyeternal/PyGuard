      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent, consistent with known malware patterns such as stealthy payload execution, evasion, and potential persistence or further payload download."
