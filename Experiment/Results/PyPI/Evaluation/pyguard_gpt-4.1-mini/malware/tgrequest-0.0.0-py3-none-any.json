      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and other sensitive user data. It collects Discord tokens from various browsers and Discord client storage, decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData), and gathers system information such as IP address and username. The stolen data is then exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL via HTTP POST requests. The code also searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files and folders with keywords related to accounts, passwords, and secrets, uploads these files to anonymous file hosting services, and sends links to the attacker. It uses threading to perform these actions concurrently and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, decryption of protected data, exfiltration of sensitive credentials without user consent, and the overall behavior of harvesting and sending private user information classify this code as malicious. This is consistent with known patterns of information-stealing malware."
