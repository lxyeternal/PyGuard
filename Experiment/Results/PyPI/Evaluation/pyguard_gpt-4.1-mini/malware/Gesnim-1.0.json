      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a function zzr() that, when executed, checks if the platform is Windows ('win32'). If so, it downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL hosted on a GitHub raw content link (https://github.com/jagermager999/8746465cdg78cdsxasy8a/raw/main/test.exe) without any user interaction or consent. It saves this file with a suspicious temporary filename ('tmp_file_pypi_29x7d0kf8.exe') and immediately executes it using os.system with the 'start' command, which launches the executable on Windows. This behavior is a classic pattern of remote payload retrieval and execution, commonly used in malware for payload delivery and system compromise. The code is embedded in a setup.py script, which means it will execute during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. There is no validation, user notification, or error handling around the download and execution steps, increasing the risk. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard URL to download an executable and immediate execution without user consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
