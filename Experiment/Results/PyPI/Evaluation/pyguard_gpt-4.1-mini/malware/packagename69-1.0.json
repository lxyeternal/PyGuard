      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious credential stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and wallet data. It collects sensitive user data from various browsers and Discord client storage locations by decrypting stored credentials using Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData). It then exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is a common technique for covert data theft. The code installs required dependencies silently if missing, uses threading to perform concurrent data collection, and uploads stolen data including tokens, passwords, cookies, billing info, and friend lists. It also searches user directories for files with keywords related to accounts and secrets, uploads them to anonymous file hosting, and sends links to the attacker. The code runs automatically without user consent, uses obfuscation techniques (e.g., base64 decoding, encrypted keys), and performs network communication to attacker-controlled endpoints. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, automated credential extraction, decryption of protected data, and exfiltration of sensitive information clearly indicate malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware."
