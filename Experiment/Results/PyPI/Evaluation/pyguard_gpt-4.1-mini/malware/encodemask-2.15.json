      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens during the setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, enabling arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with known malware delivery and execution techniques."
