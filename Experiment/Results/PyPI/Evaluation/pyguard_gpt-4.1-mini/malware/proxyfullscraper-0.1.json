      "malicious_behavior": "The code enumerates files in user storage directories (e.g., '/storage/emulated/0' and '/sdcard/DCIM'), specifically targeting files with extensions '.py', '.php', '.zip', and image files (.png, .jpg, .jpeg). It then sends these files and their metadata (filename and path) to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID via Telegram Bot API endpoints. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user files without any user interaction or consent. The use of hardcoded Telegram bot credentials and direct upload of files to an external service is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code suppresses exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The absence of legitimate application logic or user notification, combined with automated scanning and exfiltration of files from sensitive user directories, classifies this code as malicious."
