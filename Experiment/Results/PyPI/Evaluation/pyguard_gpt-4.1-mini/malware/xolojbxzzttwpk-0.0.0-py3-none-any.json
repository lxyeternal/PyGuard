      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and executes the decoded payload via exec(). The decoded payload itself appears to be an extremely large and complex obfuscated script, which is a common technique used by malware to evade static analysis and hide malicious intent. The use of exec() on base64-decoded data is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution from an obfuscated source. Such behavior is strongly associated with malicious activity, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential system compromise. The absence of any legitimate application logic, combined with the obfuscation and dynamic execution, confirms that this code contains malicious behavior."
