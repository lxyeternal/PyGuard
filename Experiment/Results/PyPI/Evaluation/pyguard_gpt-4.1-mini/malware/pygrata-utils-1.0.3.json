      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system and user information, including AWS IAM security credentials from the instance metadata service, AWS credentials files, environment variables, SSH keys, and .env files. It gathers system details such as hostname, username, current working directory, and IP address. The collected data is concatenated and written to a randomly named text file in the local directory without user consent. The code then exfiltrates this sensitive information by sending HTTP POST requests with the data to suspicious, hardcoded external domains (http://graph.pygrata.com:8000/upload and http://graphs.pygrata.com/api.php), which are not standard or trusted endpoints. Additionally, it performs a DNS query with an encoded username to a suspicious subdomain, likely for covert tracking or signaling. The entire process is executed silently with exception suppression and no user interaction or notification. The presence of this data harvesting and exfiltration logic embedded in a setup script (commonly executed during package installation) strongly suggests a supply chain attack vector. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as credential theft, environment reconnaissance, and unauthorized data exfiltration, confirming the code is malicious."
