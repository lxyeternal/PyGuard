      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It hooks into the package installation process by subclassing setuptools.command.install.install and overriding the run method to execute a function 'send' immediately after installation. The 'send' function collects the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' (system hostname) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php'. This is a form of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration without user consent. Furthermore, if the platform is Windows ('win32'), it downloads an executable file from another suspicious URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', saves it locally as 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe', and immediately executes it using 'os.system' with the 'start' command. This behavior is a classic remote payload retrieval and execution pattern, typical of malware delivery and persistence mechanisms. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection and error reporting. The use of hardcoded, non-standard domains unrelated to the package name, combined with automatic execution of downloaded code during installation without user interaction or validation, strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector. These patterns align with multiple critical risk indicators and typical malicious behaviors, including environment discovery, data exfiltration, remote payload download, and execution triggered by package installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
