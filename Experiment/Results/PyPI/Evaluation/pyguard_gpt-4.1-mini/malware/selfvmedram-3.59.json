      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated PowerShell payloads stealthily. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or analysis. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. This code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, executing malicious payloads during package installation without user consent. The rest of the setup call appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Based on the extensive knowledge points, this pattern of hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands in a setup script is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malware."
