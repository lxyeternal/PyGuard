      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) that appears unrelated to the stated purpose of the package and is likely used to download or execute a malicious payload. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The subprocess call uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, the malicious code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known supply chain attack vector to execute code during package installation without user consent. The package metadata uses generic and misleading names ('libpostvmgrand', 'modlib') and an author email that does not correspond to a known legitimate source. All these factors combined strongly indicate that this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated, and potentially harmful payload during installation, consistent with malicious behavior."
