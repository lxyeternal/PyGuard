      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution window. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or to detect analysis environments. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled origin. The malicious payload is embedded directly in the setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy to disguise the malicious intent as a legitimate package. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, the use of a suspicious directory check, and the lack of any legitimate application logic around this behavior strongly indicates malicious intent."
