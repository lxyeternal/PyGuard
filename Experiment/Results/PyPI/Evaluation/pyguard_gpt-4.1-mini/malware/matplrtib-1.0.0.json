      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute arbitrary code during installation without user consent. The run() method checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing obfuscated code at install time is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation (a known supply chain attack vector). The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution without transparency or user interaction further confirms the malicious nature. Additionally, the package name 'Matplrtib' is a likely typo-squatting of the legitimate 'matplotlib' package, which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The setup script also declares dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests' which are used only for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute hidden malicious code on Windows systems during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
