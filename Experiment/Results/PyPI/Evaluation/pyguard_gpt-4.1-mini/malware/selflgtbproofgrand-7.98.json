      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands used to evade detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade analysis or ensure persistence. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover, as it defines a package with a generic description unrelated to the actual behavior. The subprocess call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide the process window, further indicating stealth. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell payload during package installation or execution without user consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector and a hallmark of malicious code."
