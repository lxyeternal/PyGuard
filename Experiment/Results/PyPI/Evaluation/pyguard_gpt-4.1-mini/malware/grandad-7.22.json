      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a conditional execution pattern often used by malware to avoid repeated execution or detection. This execution happens at import or setup time without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard-looking setup() call, likely to disguise the malicious payload. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package installation is a critical indicator of malicious intent, consistent with stealthy code execution, potential payload delivery, or persistence mechanisms."
