      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing arbitrary, obfuscated code at install time without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution during installation strongly indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent and evade static analysis. The obfuscated class name, meaningless description strings, and the presence of network-related modules (requests) further support the suspicion that the decrypted code likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading additional payloads, exfiltrating data, or establishing persistence. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious Python code, including arbitrary code execution during package installation, use of cryptography to hide payloads, and execution of decrypted code without validation or user notification."
