      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which when decoded reveals a PowerShell invocation that downloads and executes an executable from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) with a query string that looks like a random or obfuscated payload. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens silently without user consent or notification, embedded in a setup script, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The presence of a suspicious author email and domain (EsqueleSquad, tahgoficial@proton.me, www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports malicious intent. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a potentially malicious payload during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
