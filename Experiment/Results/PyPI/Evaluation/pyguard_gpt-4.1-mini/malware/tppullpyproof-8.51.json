      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or analysis. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the command window and executes obfuscated code without user consent or interaction. This behavior is embedded in the setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation without user consent."
