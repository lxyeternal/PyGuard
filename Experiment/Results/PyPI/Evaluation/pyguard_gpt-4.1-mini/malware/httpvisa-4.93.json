      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. This execution happens during the import phase of the setup script, which means it triggers on package installation or import without user consent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious behavior within a seemingly benign package installation script. These factors combined—hidden PowerShell execution, encoded command, conditional execution, and embedding in setup.py—are strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware delivery mechanisms."
