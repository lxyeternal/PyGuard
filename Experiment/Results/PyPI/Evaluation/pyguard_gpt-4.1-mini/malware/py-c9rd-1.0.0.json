      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class GruppeInstall that overrides the install command in setuptools. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of encrypted payload and exec() hides the true intent of the code, making static analysis difficult. The code also imports 'requests', indicating potential network activity, although the exact decrypted payload is not visible here. The presence of this encrypted and dynamically executed code in the install hook, combined with no user interaction or validation, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as: execution of obfuscated code at install time, use of cryptography to hide payload, dynamic code execution via exec(), and abuse of the package installation process for arbitrary code execution."
