      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the stated package purpose. The malicious payload is embedded in the setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute code during package installation without user consent. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command to execute hidden code is a hallmark of malware attempting to run arbitrary commands stealthily. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package installation."
