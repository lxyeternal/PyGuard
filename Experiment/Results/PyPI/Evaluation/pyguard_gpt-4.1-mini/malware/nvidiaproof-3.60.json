      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens silently without user consent or notification, and the use of hidden PowerShell with encoded commands is a hallmark of malware aiming for stealth, persistence, or further payload delivery. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
