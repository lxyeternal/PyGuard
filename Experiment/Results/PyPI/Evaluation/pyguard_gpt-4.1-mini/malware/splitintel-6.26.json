      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which when decoded reveals a command that invokes a hidden PowerShell process to download and execute an executable from a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and save it as '~\\WindowsCache.exe', then execute it. This behavior is consistent with malware that downloads and runs a remote payload without user consent or interaction, using obfuscation and hidden windows to evade detection. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The presence of silent exception handling (try-except pass) further indicates an attempt to avoid detection or error reporting. All these factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent."
