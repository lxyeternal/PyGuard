      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that, during package installation, downloads a Python script from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this downloaded content directly to disk as 'ratfinal.py' and immediately executes it using subprocess.check_call with the current Python interpreter. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector enabling remote code execution at install time, which is strongly associated with malware. The absence of validation, user notification, or integrity checks on the downloaded file, combined with execution of arbitrary remote code during installation, is a critical indicator of malicious intent. The use of a Discord CDN URL to fetch the payload is non-standard and suspicious for a legitimate package. Overall, this code exhibits multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns consistent with malicious behavior."
