      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or analysis. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command is a classic malware behavior to execute hidden payloads without user consent or interaction. This code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing arbitrary code execution during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell payload during installation without user consent, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
