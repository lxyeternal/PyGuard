      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code at install time strongly indicates malicious intent. The package name 'Matplotlub' is a typo-squatting attempt to mimic the legitimate 'matplotlib' package, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) in the install hook further suggests potential for downloading or executing further malicious payloads. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including code execution during installation, obfuscation, encrypted payload execution, and potential for remote code execution, making it malicious."
