      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW, suppressing any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The malicious payload is embedded in the setup script, which means it will execute during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, the use of suspicious domain/email, and the stealth techniques strongly indicate malicious intent."
