      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious code during package installation without user consent. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a hallmark of malware aiming for stealth, persistence, or further payload execution. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, this code is highly indicative of a malicious package designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands on Windows systems during installation."
