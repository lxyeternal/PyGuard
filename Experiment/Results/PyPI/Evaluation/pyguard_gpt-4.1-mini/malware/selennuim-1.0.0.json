      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malware. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during setup installation strongly suggests intent to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine. The package setup metadata is also suspicious, with meaningless author and description fields, further indicating malicious intent. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution during install, obfuscation, use of cryptography to hide payload, and execution of decrypted code without validation or user interaction."
