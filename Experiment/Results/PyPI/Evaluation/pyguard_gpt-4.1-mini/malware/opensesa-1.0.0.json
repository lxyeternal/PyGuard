      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides the run() method to execute additional code during package installation. Inside the run() method, it checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, encrypted payload, and execution during installation aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution, obfuscation, and abuse of the package installation process. The package setup also declares dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook, further supporting the malicious nature. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction surrounding this behavior, and the encrypted payload is executed silently during installation, which is a hallmark of malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
