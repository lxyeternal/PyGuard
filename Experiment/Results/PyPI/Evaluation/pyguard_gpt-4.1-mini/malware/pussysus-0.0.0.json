      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding, including hex-encoded strings, base64 decoding, and dynamic evaluation via eval. It uses the 'eval' function on decoded and decompressed data, which is a critical red flag for arbitrary code execution. The code dynamically imports modules and executes decoded payloads without any user interaction or consent. The obfuscation and use of eval on runtime-decoded data strongly indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent and evade static analysis. Such patterns are consistent with malware behaviors, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential data exfiltration. The code does not contain any legitimate application logic or user-driven workflows and instead focuses on decoding and executing hidden payloads, which is a hallmark of malicious activity."
