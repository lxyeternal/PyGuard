      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). This means arbitrary code execution occurs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload and exec() to run decrypted code is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique commonly used in malware. The code is embedded in the setup.py install hook, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The package metadata and class names are obfuscated and meaningless, further indicating malicious intent. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: arbitrary code execution at install time, use of cryptography to hide payload, execution of decrypted code via exec(), and no user notification or validation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
