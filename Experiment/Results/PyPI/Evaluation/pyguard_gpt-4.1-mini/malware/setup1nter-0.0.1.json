      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is obfuscated using base64 encoding and dynamic imports, which is a common evasion technique in malicious scripts. After decoding, it imports modules to create a temporary file and writes to it the result of executing an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded suspicious IP address (http://20.226.18.203/). The code then executes the downloaded content as a shell command. This sequence—downloading executable code from a hardcoded external IP, writing it to a temporary file, and executing it without user consent or validation—is a classic pattern of remote code execution malware. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding and indirect imports), hardcoded suspicious IP addresses, dynamic execution of downloaded code, and lack of error handling or user interaction strongly indicate malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious and likely designed to fetch and execute a remote payload, potentially compromising the host system."
