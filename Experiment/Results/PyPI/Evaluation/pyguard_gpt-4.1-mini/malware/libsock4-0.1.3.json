      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It writes a temporary Python script file containing an obfuscated one-liner that fetches and executes code from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://pub-6604e90a2a124b9a829b977f9fe4aeec.r2.dev/W0IyABv1wrUvm) without any user interaction or consent. This downloaded code is executed immediately via exec(), enabling arbitrary remote code execution. Furthermore, the script attempts to launch this temporary file using a system shell command on Windows, replacing the Python executable name with a suspicious variant (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe'), which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The malicious payload is embedded within the setup script of a Python package, which is a known supply chain attack vector, allowing code execution during package installation. The use of obfuscated variable names, silent exception handling, and execution of remote code during installation without validation or user notification confirms this is a high-risk malicious pattern consistent with malware delivery and execution."
