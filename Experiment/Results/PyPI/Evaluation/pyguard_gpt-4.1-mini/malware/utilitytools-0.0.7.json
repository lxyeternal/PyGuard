      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a function 'notmalfunc' that downloads an executable file ('pics.exe') from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe) without any user interaction or consent. After downloading, it attempts to execute this file using subprocess.Popen, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's system. This function is called automatically during the package installation process via the 'AfterInstall' class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the 'run' method to invoke 'notmalfunc'. This means that simply installing this package triggers the download and execution of potentially malicious code, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded external URL to fetch an executable, lack of validation or user notification, and execution of the downloaded file during installation are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the code imports 'requests' solely to perform this download, and the executable is saved and run without any integrity checks or safeguards. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote payload retrieval, arbitrary code execution during install, and execution of untrusted code without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe) without any user interaction, validation, or consent, writes it directly to disk, and immediately executes it using subprocess.Popen. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system. The absence of error handling, user notification, or integrity checks, combined with the direct execution of a downloaded executable from an untrusted source, strongly indicates malicious intent. Such behavior is commonly used for payload delivery, persistence, or further compromise, and is consistently associated with malware."
