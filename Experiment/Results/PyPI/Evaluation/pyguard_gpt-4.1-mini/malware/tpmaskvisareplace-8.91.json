      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' are suspicious and unrelated to the stated package purpose. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover, as the actual package name and description do not align with the hidden execution. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command with encoded payload and hidden window style is a hallmark of malware attempting to run code silently during package installation or execution. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during setup, and lack of user consent or notification. Therefore, this code is malicious."
