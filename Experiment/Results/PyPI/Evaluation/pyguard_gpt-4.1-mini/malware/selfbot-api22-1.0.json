The final line uses multiple layers of decoding and decompression (base64.b85decode, base64.b32decode, base64.b16decode, base64.b64decode, lzma.decompress, zlib.decompress, marshal.loads) followed by exec() to execute the decoded payload. This pattern is a strong and well-known indicator of malicious intent, as it hides and dynamically executes arbitrary code, bypassing static analysis and code review. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup.py script, which means it will execute during package installation without user consent, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The obfuscation, lack of transparency, and dynamic execution of compressed and encoded data are consistent with malware behavior. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
