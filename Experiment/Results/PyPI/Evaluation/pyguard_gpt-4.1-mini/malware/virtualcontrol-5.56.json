      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in a setup script context, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation. The use of subprocess with hidden window style and encoded PowerShell commands, combined with the lack of error handling and silent exception suppression, strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at stealthy code execution and potential further payload delivery."
