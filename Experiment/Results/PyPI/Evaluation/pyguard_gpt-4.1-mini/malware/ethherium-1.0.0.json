      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute hidden malicious code during installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). It imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules dynamically and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing obfuscated code at install time without user consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution. The use of an encrypted payload hides the true intent and evades static analysis. The class and variable names are obfuscated and meaningless, further indicating an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The setup script also specifies suspicious package metadata and dependencies ('fernet', 'requests') that are used only in the malicious install hook. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as code execution during installation, obfuscated payloads, use of cryptography to hide payload, and lack of user interaction or notification. Therefore, this code is malicious and poses a high security risk."
