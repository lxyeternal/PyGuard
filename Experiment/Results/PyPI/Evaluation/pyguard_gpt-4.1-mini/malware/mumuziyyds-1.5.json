      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the contents of the file '/flag', the current login username, hostname, platform details, and the local IP address. It then encodes this data using base64 with a custom prefix and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://124.70.159.15:60006). This exfiltration of potentially sensitive data occurs immediately upon execution without any user interaction or consent. Furthermore, this data collection and exfiltration is embedded directly in the setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded IP address, silent exception handling, and the absence of legitimate application logic around the network activity strongly indicate malicious intent. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators such as environment fingerprinting, data exfiltration, use of hardcoded suspicious endpoints, and execution of network communication during package installation without user consent."
