      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup or import is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. These factors combined indicate a high risk of malicious intent."
