      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to legitimate package sources. The malicious payload is embedded in the setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute code during package installation without user consent. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command with encoded payload and hidden window style is a hallmark of malware attempting to run arbitrary code stealthily. The rest of the setup call appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious execution. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package setup, confirming it is malicious."
