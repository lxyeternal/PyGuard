      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which when decoded reveals a command to invoke a web request to a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden window. This behavior is consistent with remote payload retrieval and execution without user consent, a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The malicious payload execution is embedded in the setup script, which means it triggers during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a suspicious author email and domain (EsqueleSquad, tahgoficial@proton.me, and www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports malicious intent. The rest of the setup call appears to be a facade to disguise the malicious activity. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a potentially harmful executable on Windows systems during package installation, without user interaction or consent."
