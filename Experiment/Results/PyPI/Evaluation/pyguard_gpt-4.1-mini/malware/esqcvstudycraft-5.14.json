      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens silently without user consent or interaction, and the subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to avoid any visible window. The presence of this obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution in a setup script (commonly run during package installation) strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector or malware delivery mechanism. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. All these factors combined match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including stealth execution, obfuscation, execution during installation, and use of encoded PowerShell commands."
