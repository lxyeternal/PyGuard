      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known vector for executing code during package installation without user consent. In the overridden run method, after running the standard install, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (\"https://cdf5rwk2vtc0000c78d0ggz1hqeyyyyyb.oast.fun\"). This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns: it performs environment discovery and immediate data exfiltration during package installation, uses a hardcoded suspicious URL unrelated to the package's stated purpose, and does so without user interaction or notification. The use of a custom install command to trigger network communication during installation is a classic supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network call or data collection. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information stealing and supply chain attack techniques."
