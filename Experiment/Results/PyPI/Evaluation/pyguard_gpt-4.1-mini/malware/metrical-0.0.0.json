      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding, including hex-encoded strings, base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and dynamic evaluation via eval(). It dynamically imports modules and executes decoded payloads without any user interaction or consent. The code constructs and executes shell commands, decodes and decompresses large embedded byte strings, and runs the resulting code dynamically. Such behavior is a classic hallmark of malware, as it hides the true intent and payload from static analysis and enables arbitrary code execution. The use of eval on decompressed data, dynamic imports, and execution of shell commands in a non-transparent manner strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and payload delivery without validation or user notification."
