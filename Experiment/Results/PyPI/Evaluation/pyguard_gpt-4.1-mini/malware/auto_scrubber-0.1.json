      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setuptools installation script, which triggers execution during package installation without user consent, a common supply chain attack vector. The code uses obfuscated byte arrays and cryptographic hashing to generate keys for XOR decryption of hardcoded, obfuscated URLs. It then performs an HTTP GET request to these suspicious URLs (decoded from obfuscated data), downloads binary content, decrypts it via XOR with a generated key, writes the resulting executable to a hidden user directory (~/.local/bin/AutoScrub), sets executable permissions, and immediately executes it as a subprocess with output suppressed. This sequence is a classic remote payload retrieval and execution pattern, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The installation command subclass scans specific obscure directory patterns in the user's home directory and triggers this payload deployment only if certain conditions are met, indicating targeted or conditional execution. The absence of any user interaction, validation, or integrity checks, combined with obfuscation, network retrieval of executable code, writing to user directories, and immediate execution, confirms this is a malicious backdoor or downloader implant. This behavior aligns with known malware patterns such as remote code execution during package installation, obfuscated payload delivery, and stealthy execution, posing a critical security risk."
