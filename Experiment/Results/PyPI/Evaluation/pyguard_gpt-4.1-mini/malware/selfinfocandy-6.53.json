      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade detection or repeated runs. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest suspicious origins. The use of subprocess to run an encoded PowerShell command in a hidden window without user consent or interaction is a hallmark of malware, often used for downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise. Additionally, the malicious code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute code during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical to avoid detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code execution, stealth, and potential payload delivery."
