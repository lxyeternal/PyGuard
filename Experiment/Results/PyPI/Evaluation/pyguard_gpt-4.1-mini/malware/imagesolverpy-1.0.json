      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically writes a Python script to a temporary file that contains an exec() call on code fetched directly from a hardcoded external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/qygou/raw). It then attempts to execute this script using the Python interpreter in a new process without any user interaction, validation, or consent. This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior because it enables arbitrary remote code execution from an untrusted source. The use of exec() on network-fetched code, writing to a temp file, and immediate execution via os.system are all strong red flags. The code suppresses exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. According to the provided knowledge points, this sequence is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a critical risk pattern for remote payload retrieval and execution, typical of malware infection chains."
