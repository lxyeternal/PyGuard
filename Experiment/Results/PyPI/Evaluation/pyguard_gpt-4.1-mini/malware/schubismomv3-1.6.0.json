      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools' install command to execute code during package installation without user consent, a known supply chain attack vector. Specifically, on Windows systems, it silently installs a package named 'fernet', then uses it to decrypt a large, obfuscated payload embedded as a base64-encoded string. This decrypted payload is written to a file named 'gruppe.py' in the user's APPDATA directory, a common location for persistence or hiding malicious files. Immediately after writing, it launches this script in a hidden, detached process, preventing user awareness. The use of encrypted payloads, dynamic decryption, file writing to system directories, and execution during installation are hallmark signs of malware aiming for stealth, persistence, and arbitrary code execution. The package metadata and author information are suspicious and likely intended to mislead. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine during package installation, confirming its malicious nature."
