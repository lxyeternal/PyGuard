      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects Roblox authentication cookies from multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Brave) without user consent by accessing browser cookie stores via the 'browser_cookie3' module. It extracts the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie, which is a sensitive authentication token for Roblox accounts. The script then gathers system information such as the hostname, IP address, and username. It writes this data into a local file in a hidden directory under the user's Documents folder. Subsequently, it exfiltrates this sensitive information and the stolen cookies to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint not related to the user's system or Roblox. The script runs in an infinite loop, sending updated stolen data every 3 hours without any user interaction or notification. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious code, including unauthorized credential theft, data exfiltration to a hardcoded external endpoint, use of hidden directories for staging stolen data, and continuous background operation without consent. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed for stealing Roblox account cookies and exfiltrating them to an attacker-controlled Discord webhook."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious token grabber targeting Discord and Google Chrome data. It collects sensitive information including Discord tokens, Chrome saved passwords, and cookies by decrypting Chrome's encrypted data using the Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData). It also takes a screenshot of the victim's screen. The stolen data is saved into files in a hidden temporary directory and then compressed into a ZIP archive. This archive, along with detailed user and system information (including IP address, geolocation, computer name, and user login), is exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL via HTTP POST requests. The code forcibly kills Discord processes and injects malicious code into Discord's local files to maintain persistence or further compromise. It also attempts to bypass BetterDiscord protections by modifying its files. The use of hardcoded webhook URLs, environment variable access to sensitive directories, decryption of protected credentials, silent exception handling, and automatic data exfiltration without user consent are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This code is designed for credential theft, privacy invasion, and unauthorized data exfiltration, fitting the profile of information-stealing malware."
