      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It collects extensive sensitive data from the victim's system, including Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords, credit card data, Roblox cookies, Minecraft files, and system information such as Windows keys, hardware IDs, IP address, and geolocation. It decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption, indicating intent to steal protected credentials. The code also performs clipboard hijacking by monitoring the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet addresses and replacing them with attacker-controlled addresses to steal cryptocurrency. It attempts to establish persistence by copying itself to the Windows startup folder. The malware kills processes related to Discord and debugging tools to evade detection. It exfiltrates all collected data and files to a hardcoded external Discord webhook URL (https://kekwltd.ru/relay/bluescreen), which is a suspicious non-corporate domain. The code uses multiple threads and asynchronous calls to perform these actions stealthily and continuously. It suppresses exceptions to avoid detection and uses obfuscated function and variable names. The initial code even installs required packages via pip silently and sends the PC username to the attacker's server immediately on execution. All these behaviors—credential theft, clipboard hijacking, persistence, process killing, and data exfiltration to a suspicious external server—are hallmark traits of malicious malware, specifically an information stealer and clipboard hijacker targeting Windows users."
