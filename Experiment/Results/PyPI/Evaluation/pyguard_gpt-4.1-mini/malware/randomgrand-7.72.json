      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory or file named 'tahg' does not exist before launching this hidden PowerShell process, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or sandboxed execution. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. Such behavior is a hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading further payloads. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which serves as a disguise or delivery mechanism. The combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
