      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is highly obfuscated and contains multiple layers of base64-encoded and compressed payloads that are dynamically decoded and executed at runtime. It is embedded within a setup script, which triggers execution during package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The code performs environment discovery, including gathering system and user information, and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs and IP addresses. It writes executable content to temporary or hidden directories and executes shell commands without user consent or validation. The presence of dynamic imports, execution of decoded payloads, network communication to non-standard domains, and execution of shell commands in hidden or background threads are all strong indicators of malicious behavior. This code is designed to evade detection by static analysis through heavy obfuscation and dynamic execution, and it likely functions as a downloader or remote access trojan, capable of exfiltrating data and executing arbitrary code on the victim's system."
