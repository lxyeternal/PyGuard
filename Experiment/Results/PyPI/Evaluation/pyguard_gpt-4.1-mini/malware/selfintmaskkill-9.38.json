      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to a suspicious domain 'dl.dropbox.com' with a query parameter that appears to be an executable, and then runs a file named '~\\/WindowsCache.exe'. This pattern is consistent with downloading and executing a remote payload without user consent, a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which may be used for evasion or staging. The malicious payload execution is embedded in the setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute code during package installation. The use of a suspicious author email and domain (EsqueleSquad, tahgoficial@proton.me, www.esquelesquad.rip) further supports malicious intent. The setup call itself appears benign but is used as a cover for the hidden payload execution. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute a remote payload during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
