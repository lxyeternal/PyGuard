      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that registers a post-install hook (_post_install) to be executed when the installation process exits. This hook performs the following suspicious actions: it obtains the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the host machine, encodes it in base64, and appends it as a query parameter to a hardcoded, suspicious URL hosted on a Herokuapp domain (https://static-server-0300a62eb3f9.herokuapp.com/image.png). It then downloads the content from this URL and writes it directly to a file named 'image.png' in the same directory as the script. This behavior is characteristic of malware patterns involving environment fingerprinting (collecting hostname), encoding data to evade detection, contacting a suspicious external server, and downloading files without user consent or validation. The code executes this network activity and file writing as a side effect of package installation, without any user interaction or notification, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard external URL unrelated to the package's purpose, combined with the silent download of a file potentially used for further malicious payloads, strongly indicates malicious intent."
