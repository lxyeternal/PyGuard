      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute arbitrary code during installation without user consent. The run() method conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing obfuscated code at install time is a strong indicator of malicious intent and is commonly used in supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during setup installation strongly suggests the code is designed to deliver and execute a hidden malicious payload on Windows systems. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the code attempts to run arbitrary code fetched from the encrypted blob, which could perform any harmful actions. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution during install, obfuscation, use of cryptography to hide payload, and execution of decrypted code via exec()."
