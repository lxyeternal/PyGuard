      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This means arbitrary code execution occurs during package installation without user consent or interaction. The payload is obfuscated and encrypted, hiding its true intent, which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The use of dynamic code execution (exec) on decrypted data embedded in the install process is a classic supply chain attack vector. The package name 'requiirements' is suspiciously similar to the legitimate 'requirements' package, indicating possible typosquatting. The setup script also specifies dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook. All these factors combined indicate that this code is designed to execute hidden malicious code during installation, constituting a critical security risk."
