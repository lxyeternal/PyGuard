      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py). It collects sensitive environment information such as the hostname, current working directory, and username without user consent. It attempts to create a file in the root directory ('/root/j0j0.poc'), which is suspicious and likely unauthorized. It enumerates directory listings of sensitive system and user directories, including '/', '/root/', '/home/', and '/root/.ssh/', which may contain sensitive files such as SSH keys. This collected data is then exfiltrated via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://j0j0.xyz/lists/{hostname}/{username}/'). The entire operation occurs silently during package installation without user interaction or notification, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded non-standard domain, exfiltration of sensitive system information, and execution during install time are strong indicators of malicious intent."
