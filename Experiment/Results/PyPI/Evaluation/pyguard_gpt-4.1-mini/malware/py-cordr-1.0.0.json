      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class (GruppeInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code is executed at install time without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payloads and exec() to run decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true payload and bypasses static analysis. The code also depends on external modules (requests, fernet) specifically for this purpose. The obfuscated description and author fields further suggest an attempt to conceal malicious activity. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution during package installation, use of encrypted payloads, dynamic imports, and execution of hidden code, making it highly likely to be malicious."
