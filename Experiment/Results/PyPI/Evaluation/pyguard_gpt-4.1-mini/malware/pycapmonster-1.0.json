      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python snippet to a temporary file that imports urllib.request and executes code fetched from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/qgu3e/raw) using exec(). It then immediately attempts to run this temporary file using a system shell command without any user interaction, validation, or notification. This dynamic fetching and execution of remote code during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of exec() on network-fetched data, writing to a temp file, and spawning a new process to run that code without transparency or consent matches multiple critical risk patterns for malware, including arbitrary remote code execution, stealthy payload delivery, and evasion of static analysis. The setup() call appears to be a decoy to disguise the malicious behavior within a seemingly normal package installation script. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and should be classified as malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically writes a Python script to a temporary file that contains an exec() call on code fetched directly from a hardcoded external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/qgu3e/raw). This downloaded code is executed without any validation, user interaction, or consent, which is a critical red flag. The script then attempts to execute this temporary file using a system shell command that launches a new Python interpreter process. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code on the fly, writing it to disk, and running it without validation—is a classic hallmark of malware and remote code execution attacks. The use of obfuscated imports and variable names, silent exception handling, and execution of code from an untrusted external source further confirm malicious intent. According to the provided knowledge points, this behavior is strongly associated with malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution from untrusted, remote sources and bypasses static analysis and user consent."
