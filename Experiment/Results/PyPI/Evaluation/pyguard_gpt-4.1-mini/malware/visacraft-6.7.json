      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. It conditionally runs only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting a staging or persistence check. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in a setup script context, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a hallmark of malware aiming to execute arbitrary code stealthily. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious behavior."
