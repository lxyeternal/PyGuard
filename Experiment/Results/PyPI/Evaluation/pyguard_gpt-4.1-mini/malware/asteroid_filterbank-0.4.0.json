      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses the setuptools install command to register a post-install function (_post_install) that executes upon package installation without user interaction or consent. This function collects sensitive environment information including the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (via os.uname()[1]), and the absolute path of the package source directory. It then encodes this information in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain (https://kotko.org) with a constructed query parameter that includes the package/company name and the encoded data. This behavior is a classic example of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a non-standard, suspicious external URL unrelated to the package's stated purpose, the lack of user notification or consent, and the automatic execution of network communication during install are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the code writes a local file 'bykotko.txt' with the string 'kotko', which may be used for persistence or tracking. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate system information during installation, which is a hallmark of malicious packages."
