      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package. The use of subprocess.Popen in the setup script (which runs during package installation) to launch hidden, encoded PowerShell commands is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The rest of the setup.py code appears to be a decoy or cover, providing a seemingly legitimate package setup. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during package installation, a hallmark of malicious Python packages and supply chain attacks."
