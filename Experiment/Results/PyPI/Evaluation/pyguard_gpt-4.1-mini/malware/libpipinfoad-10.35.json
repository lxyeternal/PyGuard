      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE data, which decodes to a command that invokes a web request to a suspicious GitHub raw URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and outputs it to a file named 'WindowsCache.exe', then invokes it. This behavior is consistent with downloading and executing a remote payload without user consent or interaction, a hallmark of malware. The check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution suggests evasion or staging behavior. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The author and email fields appear to be fake or suspicious, and the overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, remote payload retrieval, and execution without user consent."
