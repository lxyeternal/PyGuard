      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL hosted on Discord's CDN and saves it to a user-specific local path within the AppData\\Local directory under the name 'explorer.exe'. It then immediately executes this downloaded file without any user interaction, validation, or notification. This pattern—downloading an executable from an external source to a hidden or user directory and executing it silently—is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The use of a non-standard filename 'explorer.exe' in a non-standard location is likely an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate Windows process. There is no error handling, no integrity checks, and no user consent, which further indicates malicious intent. According to the provided knowledge points, this sequence is strongly associated with malware, as it enables remote code execution, payload deployment, and potential system compromise."
