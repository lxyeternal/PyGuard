      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python snippet to a temporary file that dynamically fetches and executes code from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://paste.bingner.com/paste/97vnn/raw') without any user interaction or validation. It then immediately executes this temporary file using a system shell command, effectively enabling remote code execution at install time. This behavior is embedded in the setup script, which means the malicious payload is triggered during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of dynamic code execution (exec) on network-fetched content, writing and running temporary files, and silent exception suppression are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern aligns with critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution from untrusted remote sources, lack of user consent, and execution during package installation."
