      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user consent or interaction, embedded in a setup script context, which is a typical supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a hallmark of malware aiming for stealthy code execution, potentially for downloading or executing further payloads. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is overshadowed by the malicious subprocess call. Silent exception handling (except: pass) further hides any errors, increasing stealth. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious Python code."
