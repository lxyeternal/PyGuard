      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily extract sensitive authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers (Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome) using the browser_cookie3 library without user consent. It then validates the cookie and, if valid, collects detailed user information from Roblox APIs, including user ID, RAP, friends count, account age, creation date, username, Robux balance, premium status, and IP address. All this sensitive data, including the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie itself, is exfiltrated via HTTP POST to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code performs no user interaction or notification and silently exits if the cookie is invalid. This behavior matches classic credential theft and data exfiltration malware patterns, including unauthorized access to browser-stored credentials, gathering of personal and account data, and transmission to an attacker-controlled endpoint. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook for data exfiltration, absence of legitimate application logic, and lack of user consent or notification confirm the code is malicious."
