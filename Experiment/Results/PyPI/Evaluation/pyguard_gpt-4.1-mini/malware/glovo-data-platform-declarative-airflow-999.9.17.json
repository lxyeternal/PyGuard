      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the current stack trace, environment variable keys, system uname information, and the public IP address of the host by querying 'https://ipinfo.io/ip'. It then encodes a hardcoded base64 string to obtain a suspicious external URL (https://hooks.slack.com/services/...), which is a Slack webhook URL. The collected system data is sent as a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to this external webhook without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of information exfiltration. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL, the immediate sending of sensitive environment and system information to an external endpoint, and the lack of legitimate application logic or user notification strongly indicate malicious intent. The code also terminates the program immediately after sending the data, which is typical for malware trying to avoid further detection or analysis. Therefore, this code exhibits critical risk characteristics consistent with malware performing unauthorized data exfiltration."
