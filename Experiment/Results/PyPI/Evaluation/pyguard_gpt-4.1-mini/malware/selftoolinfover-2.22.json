      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, indicating an attempt to evade static analysis and detection. The command is launched only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated detection or analysis. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package repository or known software. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window, a common malware tactic. Additionally, the malicious code is embedded within a setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute code during package installation without user awareness. All these factors combined strongly indicate that this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated, and potentially harmful payloads on the victim's system, classifying it as malicious."
