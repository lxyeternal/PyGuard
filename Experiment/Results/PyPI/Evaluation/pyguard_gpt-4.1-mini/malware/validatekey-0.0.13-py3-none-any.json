      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Brave) specifically for the domain 'roblox.com' without any user consent or interaction. It then writes these cookies along with the victim's IP address, hostname, and username to a local file in a hidden directory under the user's Documents folder. Subsequently, it exfiltrates this sensitive information by sending it to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external, non-standard endpoint unrelated to any legitimate Roblox or user service. The code runs this exfiltration in an infinite loop every 3 hours, continuously stealing and sending credentials. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious code, including unauthorized credential theft, data exfiltration to a hardcoded external endpoint, use of suspicious directory paths for caching stolen data, absence of user notification or consent, and automated periodic execution. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Overall, this code is a credential stealer targeting Roblox users and is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious token grabber targeting Discord and Google Chrome data. It collects sensitive information including Discord tokens, Chrome saved passwords, cookies, and user environment details without user consent. It decrypts Chrome passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption, extracts Discord tokens from multiple local storage paths, and collects user profile information via Discord API calls. It takes a screenshot of the user's desktop and packages all collected data into a zip file. The data and the zip archive are then exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external, attacker-controlled endpoint. The code forcibly kills Discord processes, modifies Discord's local files to inject malicious code, and restarts Discord to maintain persistence or further payload execution. It also attempts to bypass BetterDiscord protections by modifying its files. The use of environment variables to locate sensitive files, silent exception handling, creation of hidden directories, and immediate data exfiltration without user interaction are strong indicators of malicious intent. The hardcoded webhook URL and the comprehensive credential theft and exfiltration behavior confirm that this code is designed for unauthorized data theft and is malicious."
