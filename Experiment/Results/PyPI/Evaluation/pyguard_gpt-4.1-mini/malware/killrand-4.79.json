      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command during the package setup process without user consent or interaction. Specifically, it checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then launches a PowerShell process with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and an '-EncodedCommand' parameter containing a base64-encoded payload. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it enables stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, a common technique used by malware to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command in hidden window mode is a hallmark of stealthy code execution. Additionally, embedding such execution in a setup script (commonly run during package installation) is a known supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution makes the entire script malicious."
