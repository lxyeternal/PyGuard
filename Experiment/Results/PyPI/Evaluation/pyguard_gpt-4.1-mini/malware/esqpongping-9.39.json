      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The execution of this command occurs during the import/setup phase without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated, and potentially harmful commands on the victim's system, consistent with malware behavior."
