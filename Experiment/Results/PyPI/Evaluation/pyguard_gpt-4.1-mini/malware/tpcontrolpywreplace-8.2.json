      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64 string that, when decoded, likely contains a PowerShell script that downloads or executes further malicious payloads from a suspicious URL (cdndiscardapp.com). The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens immediately during the setup script, which means it triggers on package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The domain and email used (EsqueleSquad, tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the described package purpose. Overall, the code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands that likely download and run malicious code, making it highly malicious."
