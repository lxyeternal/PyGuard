      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides the run() method. Inside run(), it checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using exec() on the output of Fernet symmetric decryption with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This decrypted payload is executed at install time without user consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during package installation strongly indicates malicious intent. The package name 'etherriuumm' is suspicious and likely a typoquatting attempt. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious payload execution. The decrypted payload is not visible, but the pattern of decrypting and executing code during install is a critical risk indicator of malware. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution on the victim system during package installation, which can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment."
