      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which when decoded reveals an Invoke-WebRequest command to download and execute a suspicious executable from a non-standard, suspicious domain (esquelesquad.rip). The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or ensure environment suitability. This execution happens immediately upon import or setup, without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command with encoded payload, combined with suppression of all exceptions, further indicates an attempt to evade detection and silently execute malicious code. The rest of the setup() call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators including stealth execution, obfuscated payload, suspicious external URL, execution during package installation, and no user consent, confirming it is malicious."
