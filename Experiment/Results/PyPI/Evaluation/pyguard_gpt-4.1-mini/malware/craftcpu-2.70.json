      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist before launching this hidden PowerShell process, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens immediately upon import or execution of the script, without user consent or interaction, and is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a standard-looking setup() call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. These factors—hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands, conditional execution based on file existence, embedding in setup.py, and suppression of exceptions—are strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with known malware patterns."
