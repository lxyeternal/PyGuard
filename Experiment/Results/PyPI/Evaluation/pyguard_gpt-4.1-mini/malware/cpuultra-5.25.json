      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this hidden command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or repeated execution. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. Such behavior is strongly associated with malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution in a stealthy manner during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
