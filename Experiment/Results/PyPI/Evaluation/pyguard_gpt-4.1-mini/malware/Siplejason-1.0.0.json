      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. This behavior is typical of supply chain attacks and malicious PyPI packages that execute hidden payloads during installation. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during the install phase strongly indicates malicious intent. The code also specifies dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this hidden payload execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious."
