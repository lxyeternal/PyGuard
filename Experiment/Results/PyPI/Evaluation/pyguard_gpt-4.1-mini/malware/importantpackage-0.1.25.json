      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including the contents of sensitive files (/etc/passwd, /etc/hosts), environment variables, current directory listing, process list, and user home directory files. It then serializes this data into JSON, encodes it with base64, and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded IP address (151.101.128.223) with a spoofed Host header ('psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net'). The SSL context disables certificate verification, allowing communication with potentially untrusted servers. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and exfiltration. The use of base64 encoding before transmission is a common obfuscation technique to evade detection. The hardcoded IP and spoofed Host header indicate an attempt to hide the true destination. Collecting and exfiltrating sensitive system and environment data without authorization is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration malware."
