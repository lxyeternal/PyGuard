      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: it hooks into the package installation process via a custom setuptools install command subclass, which triggers execution of the 'send' function immediately upon installation without user consent. The 'send' function collects the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' (system-specific sensitive information) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', which is unrelated to any legitimate Python package repository or service. Furthermore, if the platform is Windows ('win32'), it downloads an executable file from another suspicious URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', saves it locally with a suspicious filename 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe', and immediately executes it using 'os.system' with the 'start' command, which launches the executable without user interaction or validation. The entire operation is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, hiding any errors and evading detection. This pattern—silent environment fingerprinting, exfiltration of system information to an untrusted external server, downloading and executing a remote executable during package installation—is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification, and the URLs used are non-standard and suspicious. Therefore, this code is malicious."
