      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command in setup.py, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. During installation, it collects environment information including hostname, current working directory, and username without user consent. It then sends this sensitive system information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io), which is not related to the package's stated purpose. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: execution of network communication during package installation without user interaction, exfiltration of sensitive system data to an attacker-controlled server, use of a hardcoded suspicious URL, and embedding malicious behavior in the install script. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing and supply chain attack patterns."
