      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed without user consent or interaction. The code first checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' and only then runs the hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or target specific environments. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. This behavior is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing arbitrary code execution during package installation. No legitimate application logic justifies this hidden execution of encoded PowerShell commands, making this a high-confidence indicator of malicious intent."
