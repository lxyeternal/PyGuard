      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It includes a large base64-encoded binary blob ('aagfdc') which is decoded and written as an executable file with a randomized name in the system's temporary directory. This executable is then launched in a hidden window without user consent or interaction. The code collects system information such as the current user login and hostname, encodes it in base64, and sends it to a hardcoded external IP address (http://144.24.115.170:8080/info). This exfiltration of system data combined with the download and execution of a potentially untrusted binary is a classic pattern of malware, often used for establishing persistence or further payload delivery. Additionally, the code is triggered during installation or build processes (e.g., when 'install' or 'bdist' is in sys.argv), which is a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of extensive obfuscation, lack of error handling, and suppression of exceptions further supports the malicious nature of this code. The latter part of the code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a package named 'aiohttp_proxies', but the initial behavior of downloading and executing a hidden executable and exfiltrating system information is clearly malicious."
