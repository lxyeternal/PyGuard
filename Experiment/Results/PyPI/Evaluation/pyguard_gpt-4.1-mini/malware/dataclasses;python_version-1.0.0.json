      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, after running the standard install routine, it collects system information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external URL (https://webhook.site/284099f8-6eea-45be-9c3c-3b6b0f9ccb0e). This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: it executes code during package installation without user consent, collects potentially sensitive system information, and exfiltrates it to a hardcoded external endpoint. The use of a webhook.site URL (commonly used for testing but also abused for data collection) as a destination for this data is suspicious and not related to legitimate package functionality. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this network activity. This pattern is a known hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious PyPI packages that perform stealthy data exfiltration during installation. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior."
