      "malicious_behavior": "The code installs a package named 'fernet' via pip at runtime, which is suspicious because the legitimate cryptography library is named 'cryptography' and 'Fernet' is a class within it, not a standalone package named 'fernet'. After importing Fernet, the code decrypts a large, hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded key and immediately executes the decrypted code with exec(). This pattern of embedding an encrypted payload and executing it dynamically is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true behavior of the code and bypasses static analysis. The absence of any user interaction, the use of dynamic installation of a suspicious package, and execution of decrypted code without validation or transparency are all hallmarks of malware or malicious code. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
