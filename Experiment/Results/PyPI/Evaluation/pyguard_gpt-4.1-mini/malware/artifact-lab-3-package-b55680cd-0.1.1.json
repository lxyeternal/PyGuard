      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that execute the function 'notmalfunc' during package installation or development setup. This function collects all environment variables from the host system, encodes them as URL parameters, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain 'http://8hqnqd3insnk7efz3iiokreih9n0brzg.oastify.com'. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment information without user consent or notification. The use of a non-standard, suspicious domain for data transmission, combined with execution triggered automatically during package installation or development setup, aligns with known malicious patterns such as supply chain attacks and information stealing malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this network activity, and the code is embedded in the package setup process, which is a common vector for malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
