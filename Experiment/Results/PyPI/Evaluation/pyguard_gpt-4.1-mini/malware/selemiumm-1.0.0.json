      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. This decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which allows arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent or interaction. The use of an encrypted payload embedded in the install script, executed silently during package installation, is a classic supply chain attack vector. The package name 'selemiumm' is suspiciously similar to 'selenium' (typosquatting), and the description and long description are nonsensical strings, indicating obfuscation. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only for the malicious payload execution. The code triggers arbitrary code execution during installation on Windows systems, which is a critical risk and a hallmark of malicious behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."
