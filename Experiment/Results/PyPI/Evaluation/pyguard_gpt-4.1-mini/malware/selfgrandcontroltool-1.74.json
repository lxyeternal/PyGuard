      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) that appears unrelated to the stated purpose of the package and is likely used to download or execute a malicious payload. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which may be a persistence or evasion tactic. The subprocess.Popen call uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The entire execution is wrapped in a try-except block that silently suppresses errors, a common evasion technique. Additionally, the malicious code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known supply chain attack vector to execute code during package installation without user consent. The package metadata and naming appear to be a cover to disguise the malicious intent. All these factors combined strongly indicate that this code is malicious."
