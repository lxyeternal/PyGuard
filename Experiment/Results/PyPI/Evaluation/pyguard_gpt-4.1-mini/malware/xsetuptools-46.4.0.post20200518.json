      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including hostname, username, package name, and current working directory, encodes this data in base64, then further encodes it in hex and sends it covertly via multiple DNS ping requests to a suspicious domain ('.sub.deliverycontent.online'). It also sends the same encoded data via HTTP POST and GET requests to another suspicious hardcoded domain ('www.deliverycontent.online'). The use of multiple network communication methods (ping and HTTP requests) to exfiltrate encoded system information without user consent or interaction, combined with the use of obfuscation (base64 and hex encoding) to hide the data being sent, is a classic hallmark of malicious data exfiltration and system fingerprinting. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and unrelated to any legitimate package or application functionality. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this behavior. These factors strongly indicate that the code is designed for covert information gathering and exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, which is malicious behavior."
