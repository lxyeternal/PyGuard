      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs several actions strongly indicative of malicious behavior: It checks for the existence of a directory 'C:/ProgramData/Updater' and if absent, it silently downloads a ZIP archive from a suspicious external URL (https://transfer.sh/ODT39X/Updater.zip) without user consent or validation. It then extracts this archive into a system directory (C:/ProgramData), which is a common tactic for persistence and hiding payloads. The code proceeds to install a large number of Python packages via pip in a hidden PowerShell window, including cryptography and system interaction libraries, which are often used in malware. Finally, it executes a VBScript and a Python script from the extracted directory, again in hidden windows, enabling execution of potentially malicious payloads without user awareness. The use of hidden PowerShell windows, hardcoded suspicious URLs, writing to system directories, and execution of downloaded code during package setup are all critical risk indicators of malware and supply chain attacks. There is no user interaction, validation, or legitimate application logic justifying these actions, confirming the code's malicious intent."
