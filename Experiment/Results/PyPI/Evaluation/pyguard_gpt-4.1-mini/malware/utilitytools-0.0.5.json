      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It embeds a base64-encoded PowerShell command that is executed via os.system during the package installation process (in the AfterInstall class's run method). The decoded command runs PowerShell with flags '-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Bypass' and invokes a .NET WebClient to download a script from a suspicious hardcoded URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwdwdw/main/script.ps1) and executes it. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code is downloaded and executed without user consent during package installation. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command, execution during install, and fetching code from an external, non-standard domain are strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior enables remote code execution, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded external URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe) without any user interaction, validation, or consent, writes it directly to disk as 'pics.exe', and immediately executes it using subprocess.Popen. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system. The absence of any error handling, user notification, or integrity checks, combined with the direct execution of a downloaded executable from an untrusted source, strongly indicates malicious intent. Such behavior is commonly used for payload delivery, persistence, or further compromise, and is consistently associated with malware. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious."
