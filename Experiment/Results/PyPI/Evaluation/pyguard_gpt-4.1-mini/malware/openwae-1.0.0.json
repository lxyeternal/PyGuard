      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing arbitrary, obfuscated code at install time without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution in the install hook strongly indicates an attempt to hide malicious code execution during package installation. Additionally, the package setup specifies dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests' which are used solely for this hidden payload execution. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description further suggest an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including arbitrary code execution during installation, obfuscation, and use of cryptography to hide payloads."
