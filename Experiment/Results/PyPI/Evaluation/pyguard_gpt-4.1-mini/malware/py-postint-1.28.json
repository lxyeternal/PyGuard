      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess to run hidden PowerShell commands with encoded payloads during package setup or installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, likely to avoid detection or interruption. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including stealth execution, obfuscation, and execution triggered during package installation without user consent."
