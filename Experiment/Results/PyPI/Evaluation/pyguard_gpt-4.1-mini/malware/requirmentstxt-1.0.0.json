      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools' install command to override the run() method, which executes arbitrary code during package installation without user consent. The run() method checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), enabling arbitrary code execution. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is hidden in the setup/install script to run automatically when the package is installed. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during install time strongly indicates intent to evade detection and execute unauthorized code. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) further suggests potential for remote code retrieval or data exfiltration. Overall, this code is a high-risk supply chain malware implant that executes hidden, encrypted code during installation on Windows systems."
