      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that execute the function 'notmalfunc' during package installation or development setup. This function collects all environment variables from the host system (os.environ), encodes them as URL parameters, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://webhook.site/8f782c5b-990f-4d3d-94cc-fd128b873693), which is a known service for capturing webhooks and is commonly used for data exfiltration or testing. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation or development setup without any user interaction or consent, constituting unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment information. The use of a hardcoded suspicious external webhook URL, combined with automatic execution during install/develop commands, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including exfiltration of environment data, execution of network communication during package installation, and lack of user notification or legitimate application logic. Therefore, this code is malicious."
