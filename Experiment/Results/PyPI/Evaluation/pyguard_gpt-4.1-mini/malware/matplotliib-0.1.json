      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is heavily obfuscated using indirect attribute access, complex integer-to-character mappings, and non-ASCII variable names to hide its intent. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and automatic code execution during package installation. It performs environment checks, imports modules dynamically, and attempts to install packages via pip programmatically. The code creates and writes files in user directories, including hidden or obscure paths, and uses Windows COM interfaces to create shortcuts, indicating persistence mechanisms. It also checks for administrative privileges and conditionally executes further code, a typical privilege escalation attempt. The obfuscation and control flow complexity, combined with file system manipulation, dynamic imports, and execution of shell commands, strongly suggest it is designed to execute unauthorized actions without user consent. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as remote payload retrieval, persistence setup, and stealthy execution, confirming the code is malicious."
