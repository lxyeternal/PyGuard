      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a conditional execution pattern often used by malware to avoid repeated execution or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. The use of subprocess to run hidden PowerShell commands with encoded payloads during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system without user consent or interaction. The rest of the setup.py code appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution triggered during package installation."
