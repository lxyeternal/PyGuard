      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The command is executed without user interaction or consent, and the subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging tactic. The presence of a suspicious URL in a comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a non-standard or potentially malicious source. The execution of shell commands during the setup process without validation or user notification is a classic supply chain attack vector. All these factors combined strongly indicate that this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated, and potentially harmful payloads on the victim's system, classifying it as malicious."
