      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) that is unrelated to the package's stated purpose and likely downloads or executes a malicious payload. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running this command, which may be a persistence or evasion tactic. This execution happens during the package setup process, which is a common supply chain attack vector to run malicious code upon installation without user consent. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is used as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code matches multiple critical risk patterns including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, use of suspicious external URLs, and execution during package installation, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
