      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a setuptools setup script that subclasses the install command to execute arbitrary shell commands during package installation without user consent. Specifically, the function 'notmalfunc' decodes a base64-encoded string (placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE') and executes it via os.system. This pattern of embedding base64-encoded commands in install hooks and executing them is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system at install time. The use of base64 decoding to hide the payload, combined with execution during the install phase, strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this behavior, and the code is designed to run hidden commands automatically upon installation, which is a hallmark of malicious Python packages."
