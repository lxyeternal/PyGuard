      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this hidden command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure persistence. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of this hidden, encoded PowerShell execution in the setup context strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector or malware delivery mechanism. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command string is suspicious and likely to spawn a hidden process that could download or execute further malicious payloads. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
