      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It includes a large block of encoded and compressed data that is decoded using base64 and zlib, then dynamically executed via eval. This technique is a classic hallmark of malware, used to hide the true payload and evade static analysis. The code dynamically reconstructs and executes code from obfuscated integer sequences and compressed data, which is a critical risk pattern exclusively observed in malware samples. The use of eval on decompressed data allows arbitrary code execution, which can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further payload deployment. Additionally, the code uses obfuscated variable names and lambda functions to further conceal its intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the code does not provide any benign functionality. These factors combined confirm that the code contains malicious behavior."
