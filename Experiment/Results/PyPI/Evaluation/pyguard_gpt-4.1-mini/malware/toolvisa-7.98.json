      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist before launching this hidden PowerShell process, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script for a Python package. Such behavior is a classic hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks where malicious code is hidden in package installation scripts to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. The combination of hidden PowerShell execution, encoded commands, conditional directory checks, and embedding in a setup script strongly indicates malicious intent."
