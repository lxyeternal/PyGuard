      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the process window. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure persistence. The URL embedded in the encoded command points to a suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com) and a path that appears to be a direct executable download, which is a common vector for remote payload retrieval and execution. This behavior is triggered during the setup process of a Python package, which is a known supply chain attack vector allowing arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The combination of obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, suspicious external URL, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
