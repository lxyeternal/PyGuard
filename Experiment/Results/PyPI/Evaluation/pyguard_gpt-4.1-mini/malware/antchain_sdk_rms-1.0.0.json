      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command in setup.py, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. During installation, it collects environment information including hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This behavior constitutes environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration without user consent or notification. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded external URL unrelated to the package's stated purpose, combined with execution during package installation, strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network communication or data collection, and no error handling or user interaction is present. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including exfiltration of sensitive system information during package installation, a common supply chain attack technique."
