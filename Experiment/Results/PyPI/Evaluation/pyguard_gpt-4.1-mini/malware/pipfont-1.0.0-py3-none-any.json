      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware (stealer). It collects sensitive user data such as browser passwords, cookies, credit card information, Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Minecraft and Roblox files, and system information including Windows keys, hardware IDs, IP geolocation, and more. It decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData) and AES decryption to extract credentials. The code also performs clipboard hijacking by monitoring the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet addresses and replacing them with attacker-controlled addresses to steal cryptocurrency. It attempts to disable or kill Discord-related processes and bypass protections like BetterDiscord and DiscordTokenProtector. The stolen data is compressed into zip files and exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL (https://kekwltd.ru/relay) and other endpoints. The code creates persistence by copying itself to the Windows startup folder. It uses obfuscated function and variable names, suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, and runs background threads for continuous data collection and exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded suspicious URLs, extensive credential theft, clipboard manipulation, process killing, and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers confirms this code is malicious and designed for unauthorized data theft and potential financial fraud."
