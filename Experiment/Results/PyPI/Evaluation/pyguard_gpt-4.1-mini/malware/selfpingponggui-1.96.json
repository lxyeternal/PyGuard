      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed without user consent or interaction. The code first checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before launching this hidden process, which suggests evasion or staging behavior. This execution happens during the package setup process, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution on installation. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window, increasing stealth. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) do not correspond to any known legitimate software or package, raising suspicion. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy or cover to appear as a legitimate package. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk patterns: obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and use of suspicious directory checks, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
