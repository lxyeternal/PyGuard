      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated PowerShell payloads stealthily. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, then launches this hidden PowerShell process without any user interaction or consent. This execution happens during the import or setup phase, which is a typical supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard-looking setup() call from distutils.core, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. The use of subprocess to run hidden, encoded PowerShell commands without validation or user notification, combined with obfuscation and silent exception handling, strongly indicates malicious intent, such as downloading or executing further payloads, establishing persistence, or performing unauthorized actions on the victim system."
