      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in the setup.py script that executes automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. It imports discord and socket modules and attempts to send the host's hostname and IP address to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of system information to an external endpoint. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for sending system details during installation is suspicious and indicative of malicious intent, as it leverages the installation process (a supply chain attack vector) to silently collect and transmit potentially sensitive environment information. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying this network communication, and it occurs as a side effect of package installation, which is a known malicious pattern. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
