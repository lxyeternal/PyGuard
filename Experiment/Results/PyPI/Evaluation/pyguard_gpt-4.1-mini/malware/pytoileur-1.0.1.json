      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed during the package installation process (in the overridden InstallCommand.run method). This payload performs several suspicious and malicious actions: it checks for the existence of a specific Windows Start Menu path related to System86, creates directories if missing, writes PowerShell scripts and batch files to these directories, and executes these scripts with hidden windows. The PowerShell commands set up a WshShell COM object and run commands that download a file named 'mydownloadjob' from a suspicious external IP address (http://51.77.140.144:8086/dl/runtime) to a local directory, then execute it. This behavior is a classic example of a supply chain attack vector, where arbitrary code is executed during package installation without user consent, downloading and running potentially malicious payloads from an untrusted external source. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), execution of shell commands, writing and running files in user directories, and network communication to a hardcoded suspicious IP address are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code suppresses exceptions to avoid detection and runs these actions silently during installation, further confirming its malicious nature."
