      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a hallmark of malware delivery, remote code execution, or payload deployment. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which serves as a disguise or delivery mechanism. The combination of obfuscated, hidden command execution triggered during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
