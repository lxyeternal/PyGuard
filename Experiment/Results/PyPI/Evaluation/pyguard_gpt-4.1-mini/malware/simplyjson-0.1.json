      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and other sensitive user data. It collects Discord tokens from various browsers and Discord client storage, decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI, and gathers user environment information such as IP address and geolocation. The code then exfiltrates this stolen data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user consent or interaction. It also searches user directories for files with keywords related to passwords and accounts, uploads these files to anonymous file hosting services, and sends links to the attacker. The code uses multiple threads to stealthily collect data, kills processes to access locked files, and uses cryptographic functions to decrypt protected data. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, automated data collection and exfiltration, decryption of protected credentials, and absence of any legitimate user-facing functionality clearly indicate malicious intent. This code matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including credential theft, data exfiltration, use of DPAPI decryption, and stealthy network communication to attacker-controlled endpoints."
