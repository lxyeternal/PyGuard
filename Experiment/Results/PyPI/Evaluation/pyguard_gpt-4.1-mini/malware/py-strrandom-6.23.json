      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate Python package. The setup() call appears to be a decoy to disguise the script as a legitimate package installation script. The combination of executing an obfuscated PowerShell command in a hidden window during package setup, without user consent or interaction, is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for payload delivery, persistence, or further compromise. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as: execution of encoded PowerShell commands in hidden mode, obfuscation via base64 encoding, execution triggered during package installation, and use of suspicious domain/email references. Therefore, this code is malicious."
