      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. This behavior is embedded in the setup script, which means it triggers during package installation without user consent, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, combined with the silent exception handling (except: pass), strongly indicates malicious intent. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy, unauthorized code execution during package installation."
