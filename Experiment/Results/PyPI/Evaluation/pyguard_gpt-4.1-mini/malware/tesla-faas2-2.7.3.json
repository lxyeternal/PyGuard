      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses the setuptools install command to register a post-install function (_post_install) that executes automatically after installation without user interaction or consent. This function collects sensitive environment information including the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (os.uname()[1]), and the absolute path of the package source directory. It then encodes this information in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain (https://kotko.org) with query parameters constructed from hardcoded company and package name strings. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of system fingerprinting information to an external server. The use of a post-install hook to perform network communication and data exfiltration without user knowledge or consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. The code also writes a local file 'pocbykotko.txt' with a benign-looking string, likely to mark infection or for persistence. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network activity or data collection, and the external domain is unrelated to the package's stated purpose. Therefore, this code is malicious."
