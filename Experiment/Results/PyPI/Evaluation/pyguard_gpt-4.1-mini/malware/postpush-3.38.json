      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. This execution happens immediately upon import or setup invocation, without any user interaction or consent, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malware embedded in installation scripts. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. The combination of hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands in a setup script is a critical risk indicator of malware, consistent with known malicious patterns for remote code execution, persistence, or payload delivery."
