      "malicious_behavior": "The code embeds a data exfiltration mechanism triggered automatically during package installation or development setup phases by subclassing setuptools commands (install, develop, egg_info). It collects sensitive environment information including the package name, hostname, current user, and current working directory, serializes this data to JSON, encodes it as a hex string, splits it into chunks, and covertly exfiltrates it via DNS requests to a hardcoded external domain 'for-research.ru' using a custom DNS query function. This behavior occurs without user interaction or consent, during installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of DNS queries for data exfiltration is a stealthy technique to bypass network monitoring. The domain used is not a standard or trusted domain related to the package, indicating potential malicious intent. The code lacks error handling and logging, further suggesting stealth. Although the package description claims it is for research and not malicious, the behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including environment fingerprinting, covert data exfiltration, and execution during package installation. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
