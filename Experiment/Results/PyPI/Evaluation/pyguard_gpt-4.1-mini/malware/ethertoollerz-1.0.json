It then compresses these files into a zip archive in the TEMP directory and immediately sends this archive via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration, where potentially sensitive user data (Steam session files) is stolen and sent to an attacker-controlled endpoint. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration, absence of user interaction or notification, and immediate deletion of the temporary zip file to cover tracks are strong indicators of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code silently checks for the existence of a specific directory in the user's AppData Roaming folder (Exodus), which is typically where sensitive application data such as wallets or credentials might be stored. It then copies this directory to a temporary location, compresses it into a zip archive, and uploads the archive via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for sending potentially sensitive user data, combined with the absence of any legitimate application logic or user interaction, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to clean up the temporary files silently, which is a common anti-forensics technique. Therefore, this code is performing covert data theft and exfiltration, which is a hallmark of malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports multiple suspicious modules with names associated with cryptocurrency wallets and token finders (e.g., metamask, discord.find_tokens, exodus.runner, passwords_cards_cookies, steam, telegram). It attempts to import these modules dynamically and suppresses all exceptions, which is a common evasion technique. The function 'stha' calls functions like yea(), find_tokens(), runner(), machineinfo(), sikrinsat(), and telegram()—likely performing credential or token harvesting, system fingerprinting, screenshot capture, and data exfiltration. The use of threading to run these functions in the background without user interaction or consent further indicates stealthy, automated malicious activity. The code structure, silent exception handling, suspicious module names, and the pattern of invoking multiple potentially credential-stealing or data-collecting functions strongly align with typical malware behavior, such as information stealing and covert data exfiltration. There is no legitimate application logic, user interaction, or documentation to justify these actions. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious intent."

It uses regex patterns to extract tokens from local storage files. The collected tokens are then sent via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint controlled by an attacker. This behavior constitutes unauthorized collection and exfiltration of sensitive user credentials without consent, a classic hallmark of credential-stealing malware. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration, absence of user interaction or notification, and targeting of sensitive user data (Discord tokens) clearly indicate malicious intent."

It copies these directories to a temporary folder, compresses them into a zip archive, and then uploads the archive via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior is consistent with unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user information (such as wallet or browser extension data). The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data transmission, targeting sensitive user directories, and the absence of any legitimate user interaction or notification strongly indicate malicious intent."

This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user information. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for uploading the screenshot, combined with the lack of any legitimate application logic or user notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to delete the temporary screenshot file afterward, which is a common anti-forensics technique to reduce traces of the exfiltration. These factors align with typical malicious patterns such as unsolicited data collection and exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a clear example of malicious behavior, specifically a credential and sensitive data stealer targeting multiple Chromium-based browsers on Windows. It enumerates installed browsers by checking known local paths, then extracts sensitive data such as saved passwords, cookies, credit card information, browsing history, and download history from browser profile databases. It uses Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData) to decrypt the master encryption key and AES-GCM to decrypt stored passwords and cookies. The stolen data is saved temporarily in the user's AppData Local Temp directory, then compressed into a zip archive. Finally, the archive is exfiltrated by uploading it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is a common technique for covert data exfiltration. The code performs all these actions without any user interaction or consent, silently collecting and sending highly sensitive personal information to an attacker-controlled endpoint. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including credential theft, data exfiltration, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and abuse of Windows cryptographic APIs for unauthorized data decryption. Therefore, this code is malicious."

It then sends this sensitive fingerprinting data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint not related to any legitimate application logic. This behavior is a classic example of information-stealing malware or a system fingerprinting trojan. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration, absence of user notification, and the nature of the collected data strongly indicate malicious intent. Although the code does not execute further payloads or obfuscate its behavior, the unsolicited collection and transmission of sensitive system identifiers to an attacker-controlled server is a high-risk malicious activity."
