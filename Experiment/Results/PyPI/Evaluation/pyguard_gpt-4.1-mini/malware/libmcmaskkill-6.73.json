      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which likely performs unauthorized actions such as invoking a web request to a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) to download and execute further payloads. This execution happens conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating staging or evasion behavior. The subprocess.Popen call uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The presence of this code inside a setup script (commonly run during package installation) suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes automatically during installation without user consent. The domain and author information (EsqueleSquad, tahgoficial@proton.me) and the comment with a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) further support malicious intent. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is used as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands that likely download and run malware, making it definitively malicious."
