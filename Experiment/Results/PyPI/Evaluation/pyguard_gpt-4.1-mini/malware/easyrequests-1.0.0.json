      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of obfuscated malicious intent. The decoded payload performs multiple suspicious actions: it checks for the existence of a specific Windows Start Menu path, writes several files with PowerShell scripts and batch files into user directories, and executes shell commands that download and run executables from hardcoded external URLs (e.g., https://api-hw.com/dl/runtime and https://api-hw.com/dl/w). These actions include running PowerShell in hidden mode, downloading files without validation or user consent, and executing them, which are classic behaviors of malware aiming for remote code execution, persistence, and possibly data exfiltration or further payload delivery. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), execution during package setup, hardcoded suspicious URLs, and execution of shell commands without user interaction all strongly indicate malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or trojanized packages."
