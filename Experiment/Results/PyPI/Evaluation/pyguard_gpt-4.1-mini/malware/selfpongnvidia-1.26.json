      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded PowerShell command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The code first checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or to detect analysis environments. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of such obfuscated, encoded PowerShell commands in a setup script (which runs during package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the setup.py content is a facade to appear as a legitimate package. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including stealth execution, obfuscation, execution during installation, and use of encoded PowerShell commands."
