      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses an obfuscated payload that is base64-decoded, then decompressed with zlib, and finally executed dynamically via exec(). This pattern is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution hidden from static analysis. The payload is embedded directly in the setup script, which is executed during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. Additionally, the package is named 'rushbruhmalware' and the description explicitly states 'this is a malware, please dont install this', confirming malicious intent. The use of dynamic imports and exec on decompressed data is a hallmark of malware designed to evade detection and execute harmful actions without user consent."
