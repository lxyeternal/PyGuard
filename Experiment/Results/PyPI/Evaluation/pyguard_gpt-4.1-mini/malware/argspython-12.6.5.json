      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction or consent. It writes the downloaded content directly to a temporary file and immediately executes it using subprocess.call. This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables remote code execution of potentially untrusted and harmful payloads. The execution occurs outside of any legitimate application logic or user-driven workflow, and there is no validation, integrity check, or notification to the user. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is malicious."

It writes the downloaded content directly to a temporary file and immediately executes it using subprocess.call. This pattern matches a classic remote payload retrieval and execution sequence, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The absence of any legitimate application logic, user notification, or validation, combined with the direct execution of a downloaded binary from an untrusted source, aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution from untrusted remote sources, lack of user consent, and potential for further payload delivery or system compromise."
