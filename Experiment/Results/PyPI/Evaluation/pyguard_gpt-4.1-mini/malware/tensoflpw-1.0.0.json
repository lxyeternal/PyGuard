      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This means arbitrary code is executed at install time without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during package installation strongly indicates malicious intent. The setup script also specifies 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup requirements, which are used solely for this hidden payload execution. The encrypted payload likely contains further malicious code, and the entire pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution during install, obfuscation, use of cryptography to hide payload, and execution of network-related modules. Therefore, this code is malicious."
