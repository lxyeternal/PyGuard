      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://kekwltd.ru/kekwltd.exe) without any user interaction, validation, or notification. It saves this executable into a hidden or system-related directory under the user's APPDATA path (\\Microsoft), which is a common tactic for hiding malicious payloads. Immediately after writing the file, it executes the downloaded executable using subprocess.call with the 'start' command, which launches the file without user consent or verification. This sequence—unsolicited download of an executable from a suspicious domain, saving it in a system-related hidden directory, and immediate execution—is a classic pattern of malware delivery and execution. There is no legitimate application logic, error handling, or user consent involved, and the domain is non-standard and likely attacker-controlled. Therefore, this code exhibits critical risk malicious behavior consistent with remote payload retrieval and execution, typical of malware infection chains."
