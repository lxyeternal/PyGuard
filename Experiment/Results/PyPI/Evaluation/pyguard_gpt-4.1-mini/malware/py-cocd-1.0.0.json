      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known vector for executing arbitrary code during package installation (a supply chain attack vector). Inside the overridden run() method, it checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using exec() on the output of Fernet decryption with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This decrypted payload is not visible in the source, indicating obfuscation and hiding of the true payload. Executing decrypted code at install time without user consent is a critical risk and a hallmark of malicious packages. The use of cryptography to hide the payload, dynamic imports, and execution during installation strongly indicate a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. The package metadata and descriptions are nonsensical and obfuscated, further supporting malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the code executes arbitrary code fetched from an encrypted blob during installation, which can lead to remote code execution, persistence, or data exfiltration."
