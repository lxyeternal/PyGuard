      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The setup() call is used to disguise the package as a legitimate library, but the presence of subprocess execution with hidden PowerShell commands during installation is a classic supply chain attack vector. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated payload on Windows systems during package installation without user consent, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
