      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands used to evade detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) that appears unrelated to the legitimate package description and is likely used to download or execute a malicious payload. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The subprocess.Popen call uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, the setup() call uses a suspicious package name 'tpkillcchacked' and author 'EsqueleSquad' with an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which do not align with the described functionality and may be used to disguise malicious intent. The entire execution is wrapped in try-except blocks that silently suppress errors, a common tactic to avoid detection and analysis. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated, and potentially harmful payload during package installation or execution, consistent with supply chain attack vectors and malware delivery."
