      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to hide the actual command content from static analysis. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. This execution happens silently without user consent or notification, and the use of hidden PowerShell windows is a hallmark of malware aiming to evade user awareness and security tools. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package installation, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
