      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) without user consent or interaction. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell commands, hidden window execution, and downloading executables from non-standard, suspicious URLs are all strong indicators of malware. The rest of the setup code attempts to disguise the package as a legitimate library, but the side effect of executing the hidden payload makes this code malicious."
