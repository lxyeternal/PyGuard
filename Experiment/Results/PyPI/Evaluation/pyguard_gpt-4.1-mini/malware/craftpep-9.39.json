      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating a conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This behavior is embedded in the setup script, which means it triggers during package installation without user consent, a common supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, combined with the lack of error handling and the silent pass on exceptions, strongly indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script."
