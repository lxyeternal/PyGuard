      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, after running the standard install routine, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: it performs network communication during package installation without user consent, exfiltrates potentially sensitive system information (hostname, cwd, username) to an attacker-controlled server, uses a hardcoded suspicious URL unrelated to the package's stated purpose, and embeds this exfiltration in the setup.py install hook, a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission, no user interaction or notification, and the domain used is not a standard or trusted endpoint. These factors collectively indicate malicious intent consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware embedded in a Python package installation process."
