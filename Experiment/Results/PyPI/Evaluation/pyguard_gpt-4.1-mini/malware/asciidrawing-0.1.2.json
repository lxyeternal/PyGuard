      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that executes a network request immediately after package installation without user interaction or consent. Specifically, it sends a POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, transmitting the user's home directory path and the current timestamp. This behavior constitutes unsolicited data exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment information. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL in a post-install hook is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it exploits the package installation process (a known supply chain attack vector) to silently collect and send user environment data to an attacker-controlled endpoint. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network communication, no user notification or consent, and the data sent includes sensitive user environment details. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern—network communication embedded in install scripts, hardcoded suspicious URLs, and exfiltration of user environment data without consent—is a critical risk and a hallmark of malicious code."
