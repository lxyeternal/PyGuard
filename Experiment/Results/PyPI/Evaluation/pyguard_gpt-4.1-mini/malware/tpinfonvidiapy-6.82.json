      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It conditionally checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and if it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command is base64-encoded PowerShell script, which is a well-known obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary code stealthily. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command in a hidden window without user consent or interaction is a hallmark of malware, often used for downloading and executing further payloads or establishing persistence. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, enabling code execution during package installation. The silent exception handling (empty except blocks) further indicates an attempt to suppress errors and avoid detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden execution of external commands, suspicious domain references, and embedding in a package setup script confirms malicious intent."
