      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to hide the actual command content. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or ensure a specific environment. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in a setup script context, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious intent. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command with encoded payload and hidden window style is a hallmark of malware aiming to execute arbitrary code stealthily. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious Python code."
