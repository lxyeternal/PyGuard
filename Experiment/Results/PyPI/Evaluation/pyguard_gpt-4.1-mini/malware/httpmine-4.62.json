      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only then executes the hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure environment suitability. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of this hidden, encoded PowerShell execution in the setup context strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector or malware delivery mechanism. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command, suppression of all exceptions, and lack of any legitimate business logic around this execution further confirm malicious intent."
