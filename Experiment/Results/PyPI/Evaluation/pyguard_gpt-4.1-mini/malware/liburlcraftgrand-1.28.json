      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that invokes a web request to a suspicious GitHub raw URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and executes it silently without user consent or interaction. This occurs conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating a staging or persistence mechanism. The execution is triggered during the package setup process, which is a common supply chain attack vector to run malicious code during installation. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. The domain and author information appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate packages. All these factors combined—hidden execution, encoded PowerShell payload, downloading and running an executable from an external URL during package installation without user consent—are hallmark indicators of malware and supply chain attack behavior."
