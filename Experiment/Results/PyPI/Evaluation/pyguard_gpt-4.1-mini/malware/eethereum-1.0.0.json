      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute hidden malicious code during installation. The run() method checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. This behavior occurs silently during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code at install time strongly indicates malicious intent. The setup script also specifies suspicious package metadata and dependencies ('fernet', 'requests') that support the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, arbitrary code on Windows systems during package installation, which is a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks."
