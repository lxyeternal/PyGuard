      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads or executes content from a suspicious URL (cdnd.discordapp.com/attachments/...), which is unrelated to the stated purpose of the package. This execution happens conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating staging or persistence behavior. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation without user consent, a common supply chain attack vector. The package metadata uses suspicious author information and a misleading description unrelated to the actual behavior. All these factors combined match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, use of suspicious external URLs, and execution during installation."
