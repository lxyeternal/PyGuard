      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) which appears to be a remote executable download. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, the setup() call masquerades as a legitimate package installation script but is used here to hide the malicious payload execution. The author and email fields reference 'EsqueleSquad' and 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which may be linked to the malicious actor. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated remote payload during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector."
