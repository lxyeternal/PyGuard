      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is hardcoded and decrypted with a hardcoded key, then executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag for arbitrary code execution. This execution happens silently during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during install time strongly indicates malicious intent. The presence of network-related modules (requests) imported but not explicitly used in the visible code suggests the decrypted payload likely performs network communication or further malicious actions. This pattern matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, and potential remote payload retrieval or execution."
