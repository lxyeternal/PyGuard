      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing arbitrary, obfuscated code at install time without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution in the setup install hook strongly indicates an attempt to hide malicious code execution during package installation. Additionally, the package metadata and class names are obfuscated and nonsensical, further supporting malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution during installation, obfuscation, use of cryptography to hide payloads, and execution of decrypted code without validation or user notification."
