      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or to detect analysis environments. This execution happens during the setup script, meaning it triggers on package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command in this manner is suspicious and consistent with malware behavior. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. The silent exception handling (try-except pass) suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute an obfuscated PowerShell payload during package installation, which is a hallmark of malicious activity."
