      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding, including base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and dynamic evaluation (eval). It uses indirect and obfuscated imports and function calls, which is a common tactic to evade static analysis and hide malicious intent. The code dynamically decodes and executes payloads at runtime, a hallmark of malware. The presence of eval on decoded and decompressed data strongly indicates arbitrary code execution capability. The obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns match critical risk indicators for malware, such as remote payload retrieval, code injection, and execution without user consent. Given these factors and the absence of any legitimate or benign application logic, this code is malicious."
