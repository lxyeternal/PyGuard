      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This means arbitrary code execution occurs during package installation without user consent. The payload is obfuscated and hidden inside the install hook, a common supply chain attack vector. The package name 'seleunium' is suspiciously similar to 'selenium', indicating possible typosquatting. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution in setup.py install hook is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can deliver and run arbitrary code on the victim's machine during installation. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the code is designed to run only on Windows, further suggesting targeted malicious behavior."
