      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. This execution happens silently without user consent or interaction, and the subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which is benign by itself, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution embedded in the setup script strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during package installation. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution triggered during package setup, all without user notification or validation."
