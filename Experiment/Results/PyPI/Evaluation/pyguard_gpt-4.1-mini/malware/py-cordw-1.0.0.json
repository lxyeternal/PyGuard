      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'GruppeInstall' that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code is executed at install time without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload and exec() to run it is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true payload and bypasses static analysis. The code does not provide any legitimate application logic for this execution, nor does it handle errors or notify the user. The presence of network-related modules (requests) imported only in this context suggests potential network communication or payload retrieval within the decrypted code. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution during package installation, obfuscation via encryption, and dynamic execution of hidden payloads. Therefore, this code is malicious."
