      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a conditional execution pattern often used by malware to avoid repeated execution or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. The use of subprocess to run hidden PowerShell commands with encoded payloads during package setup or installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. The silent exception handling (try-except pass) suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated payload on Windows systems stealthily, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
