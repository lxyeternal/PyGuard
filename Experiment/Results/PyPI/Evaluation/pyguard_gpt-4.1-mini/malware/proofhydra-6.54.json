      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens immediately upon import or installation without user consent or interaction, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. Such behavior is a hallmark of malware, especially supply chain attacks or malicious PyPI packages that execute hidden payloads during installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and should be classified as malicious."
