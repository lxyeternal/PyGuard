      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs HTTP GET requests to hardcoded, suspicious, and non-standard external URLs (domains under oastify.com, which is a known domain used for security testing and can be abused for exfiltration or callback). There is no user interaction or consent before these network actions. The code contacts an external endpoint immediately upon execution and then again after a 60-second sleep, which is a common pattern for beaconing or staging in malware to check for commands or exfiltrate data. The absence of any legitimate application logic, combined with the use of hardcoded suspicious URLs and silent network communication, strongly indicates malicious intent, likely for remote command-and-control or data exfiltration purposes."
