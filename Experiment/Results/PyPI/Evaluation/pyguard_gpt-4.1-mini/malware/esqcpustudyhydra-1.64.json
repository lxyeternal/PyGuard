      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed without user consent or interaction, and the subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to avoid any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The URL embedded in the encoded command (cdndiscardapp.com) is non-standard and suspicious, unrelated to the stated package purpose. The entire payload is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of try-except blocks suppresses any errors, hiding failures and avoiding detection. The package metadata and naming appear to be obfuscated or misleading (e.g., 'esqcpustudyhydra', author 'EsqueleSquad'), which is typical in malicious packages. Taken together, these factors strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated payload during installation, consistent with malware behavior."
