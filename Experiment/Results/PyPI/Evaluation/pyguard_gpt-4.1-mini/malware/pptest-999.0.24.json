      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior primarily because it embeds network communication and data exfiltration logic inside a setuptools installation hook (InstallScripts subclass). During installation, it collects detailed system information including hostname, current working directory, local IP addresses, and public WAN IP by querying external services. It then encodes this information into DNS query payloads sent to a suspicious hardcoded domain 'burpcollaborator.net', which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction and data exfiltration in penetration testing and malware. This exfiltration occurs without user consent or notification, triggered automatically during package installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The code also attempts to manipulate pip commands and scripts, printing misleading messages to disguise its activity as a 'security test'. The use of DNS queries for covert data transmission, combined with automatic execution during install, and the hardcoded suspicious domain, strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, and the code lacks error handling or user interaction, further supporting the conclusion that it is designed for stealthy information gathering and exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, current working directory, local IP addresses, and public WAN IP address without any user interaction or consent. It then encodes this information into a payload, hashes it, converts it to hex, and sends it via DNS queries to a hardcoded suspicious domain 'hte1ck6lvk1ktcuxl0x8jfgeu50vok.burpcollaborator.net'. The use of a Burp Collaborator domain is a strong indicator of data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication. The code performs network communication to an external DNS server (Google's 8.8.8.8) and sends encoded system fingerprinting data covertly via DNS lookups, a known exfiltration technique to evade detection. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent, and the data sent includes sensitive environment and network information. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including environment discovery, covert data exfiltration, use of hardcoded suspicious domains, and absence of benign justification. Therefore, this code is malicious."
