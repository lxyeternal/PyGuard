      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the stack trace, environment variable keys, system uname data, and the public IP address of the host machine without any user interaction or consent. It then encodes this data into a JSON payload and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, base64-obfuscated URL (which decodes to a suspicious external domain 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/...'). This behavior is a classic example of information gathering and exfiltration to an external command-and-control or monitoring server. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL, the unconditional execution of the data collection and exfiltration function (except for rudimentary checks to avoid known analysis environments), and the immediate program termination after sending the data strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent, and the code is designed to stealthily fingerprint the host and exfiltrate sensitive environment and system information. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is a strong indicator of malware, specifically information-stealing or staging malware, and is considered critical risk."
