      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and string concatenation with eval and compile, which is a common evasion technique to hide malicious intent. The code dynamically decodes and executes a large payload, which is typical of malware attempting to conceal its true functionality. It imports numerous modules related to networking, cryptography, subprocess execution, and system information gathering, and it performs environment discovery and data encoding. The code includes asynchronous functions that send HTTP requests to suspicious, hardcoded external domains (e.g., 'zuppa.cousinfn.com'), which are not standard or trusted sources, indicating potential data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. It also executes shell commands and manages threads during package installation, a known vector for supply chain attacks. The presence of encoded PowerShell commands, hidden process execution, and dynamic code execution from decoded payloads further confirms malicious intent. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily gather system information, communicate with remote servers, download and execute additional payloads, and maintain persistence, all without user consent or interaction, which are hallmark behaviors of malware."
