      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens during the import or setup phase without user interaction or consent, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The setup() call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly normal package installation script. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any known legitimate package. Overall, the use of hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands in a setup script is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with known malware patterns for remote code execution, stealth, and potential payload delivery."
