      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to hide the actual command content from static analysis. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens immediately upon running the script, without user interaction or consent, and is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands and no error handling strongly indicates malicious intent, likely to download or execute further payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the host system."
