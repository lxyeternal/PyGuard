      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that executes a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed without user interaction or consent, and the process is hidden from the user. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. The use of encoded PowerShell commands in a setup script (which runs during package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign, but the presence of the hidden, encoded PowerShell execution triggered conditionally makes this code malicious."
