      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to hide the actual command content from casual inspection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to evade repeated detection or analysis. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further suppresses any visible window, enhancing stealth. Additionally, the setup() call includes suspicious metadata such as the author 'EsqueleSquad' and an email 'tahgoficial@proton.me', which may be associated with malicious actors. The presence of this code in a setup script is a classic supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
