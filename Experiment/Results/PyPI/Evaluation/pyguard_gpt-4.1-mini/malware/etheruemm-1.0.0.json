      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing obfuscated and encrypted code during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution in the install hook is a known supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation. The obfuscation of class names and meaningless description strings further supports the suspicion. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
