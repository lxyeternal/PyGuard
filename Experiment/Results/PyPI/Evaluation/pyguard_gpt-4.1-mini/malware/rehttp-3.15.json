      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a conditional execution pattern often used by malware to avoid repeated execution or detection. This execution happens during the setup process, which is a common supply chain attack vector to run malicious code during package installation without user consent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command with encoded payload and hidden window style is a hallmark of malware attempting to execute arbitrary code stealthily. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, no user interaction or notification, and the payload is obfuscated. Therefore, this code is malicious."
