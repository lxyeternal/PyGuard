      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command in setup.py, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. During installation, it collects environment information including hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This behavior constitutes environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration without user consent or notification. The use of a non-standard, attacker-controlled domain for data transmission during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network call, and it occurs automatically during package installation, which is a critical risk pattern for malware and supply chain attacks."
