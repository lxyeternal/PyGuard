      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or analysis. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user interaction or consent, and is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which serves as a cover for the malicious payload. The combination of hidden PowerShell execution, encoded commands, conditional directory checks, and embedding in a package setup script strongly indicates malicious intent."
