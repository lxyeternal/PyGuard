      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python script to a temporary file that contains a command to fetch and execute code from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://54.237.36.60/inject/QrvxFGKvsSJ5E5bx) without any user interaction or validation. It then attempts to execute this script using a system call that launches a new Python interpreter process. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code dynamically, writing to temporary files, using hardcoded IP addresses, and executing shell commands without user consent—is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The absence of error handling and the silent suppression of exceptions further indicate an attempt to evade detection. According to the provided knowledge points, this combination of dynamic code execution from a remote source, file writing, and shell execution is a strong indicator of malware."
