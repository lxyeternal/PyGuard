      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade detection or repeated runs. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a non-standard or suspicious source. The use of subprocess to run a hidden PowerShell encoded command during the setup process (package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, as it allows attackers to run arbitrary, obfuscated commands on the victim's machine stealthily. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is a clear example of malicious behavior embedded in a Python package installation script."
