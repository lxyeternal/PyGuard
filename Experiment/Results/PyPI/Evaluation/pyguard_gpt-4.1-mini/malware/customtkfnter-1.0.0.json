      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing an obfuscated payload during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code executes arbitrary code at install time without user consent or interaction, which can lead to remote code execution, persistence, or further payload delivery. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution in the install hook strongly aligns with known malicious behaviors such as arbitrary code execution during package installation, a critical risk pattern. Therefore, this code is malicious."
