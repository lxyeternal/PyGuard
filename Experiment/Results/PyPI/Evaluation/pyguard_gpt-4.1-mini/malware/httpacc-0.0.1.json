      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the PC username (derived from the home directory path), the MAC address, and the public IP address. It then queries a third-party geolocation API (ip-api.com) to gather detailed location and network information about the IP address. This collected data is formatted and sent via an HTTP POST request to an external URL that is base64-encoded in the code. Decoding the base64 string reveals a suspicious webhook URL (https://dude.ong/api/proxy), which is not a standard or trusted domain. The code performs this data collection and exfiltration without any user interaction, consent, or notification. The use of a hardcoded, obfuscated external endpoint for sending detailed system and network information strongly indicates malicious intent, specifically information stealing and data exfiltration. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven context justifying this behavior, and the pattern matches known malware characteristics such as environment discovery, data encoding, and unsolicited transmission of sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server."
