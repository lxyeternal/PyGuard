      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, indicating an attempt to evade static analysis and detection. The command is launched only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated detection or analysis. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package repository or known software. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window, a common malware tactic. This code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious payloads during package installation. All these factors combined strongly indicate that this code is malicious."
