      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded within a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The code contains large base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and executed dynamically via exec(), a classic obfuscation and code injection technique. It performs environment discovery, including gathering system and user information, and sends this data to hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. The code writes files to temporary or hidden directories with obfuscated names and executes shell commands, including spawning new threads and processes, often in a hidden or non-interactive manner. The presence of dynamic imports, network communication to non-standard domains, and execution of downloaded or decoded code without user consent further confirm its malicious intent. These behaviors align with known malware patterns such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, persistence mechanisms, and evasion techniques. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
