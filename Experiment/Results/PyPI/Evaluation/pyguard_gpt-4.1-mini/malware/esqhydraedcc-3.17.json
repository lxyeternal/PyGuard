      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) that is unrelated to the stated purpose of the package and is likely used to download or execute a malicious payload. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens during the setup process of the package, which is a known supply chain attack vector allowing code execution without user consent. The package metadata and naming appear to be obfuscated or misleading (e.g., 'esqhydraedcc', author 'EsqueleSquad'), further suggesting malicious intent. The subprocess.Popen call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, increasing stealth. The entire block is wrapped in a try-except that silently suppresses errors, which is typical for malware to avoid detection or crashing. Taken together, these factors strongly indicate that the code is designed to stealthily download and execute a malicious payload during package installation, constituting malicious behavior."
