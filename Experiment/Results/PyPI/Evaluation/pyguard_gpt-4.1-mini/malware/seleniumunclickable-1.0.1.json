      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class 'Updater' that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, it performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, obfuscated URL (constructed as 'https://transfer.sh/4gecNG/qrcodegen.py'), downloads the content, writes it to a local file named 'qrcodegen.py', and immediately executes this file using subprocess with the current Python interpreter. This behavior constitutes remote code retrieval and execution during package installation without user consent or validation. The use of an external URL to fetch executable code and run it during installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The obfuscation of the URL components and the lack of any user interaction, validation, or error handling further support the conclusion that this code is malicious."
