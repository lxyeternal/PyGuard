      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It conditionally checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and if it does not exist, it executes a PowerShell command in hidden window mode with an encoded command string. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique to execute obfuscated payloads stealthily, evading detection. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method used by malware. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate Python package. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious code during package installation without user consent. The subprocess.Popen call uses creationflags to hide the window, further indicating stealthy execution. The overall pattern matches multiple high and critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
