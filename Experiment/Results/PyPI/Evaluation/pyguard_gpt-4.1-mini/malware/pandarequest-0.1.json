      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded within a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The code contains large base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and executed dynamically via exec(), a classic obfuscation and code injection technique. It performs environment discovery, including gathering system and user information, and sends this data to hardcoded, suspicious external endpoints. The code writes executable files to obscure or hidden directories and executes them without user consent. It also spawns threads and processes to run shell commands, including PowerShell with encoded commands in hidden windows, which is a known method for stealthy execution and evasion. The presence of hardcoded URLs, dynamic code execution from network-fetched or decoded data, and execution during package installation strongly indicate a supply chain attack aiming for remote code execution, persistence, and data exfiltration. These behaviors align with known malware patterns and are not consistent with benign or legitimate software."
