      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute hidden malicious code during installation. The run() method checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution from an obfuscated source. The payload is embedded as a base64-encoded and encrypted blob, which is a common obfuscation technique to evade detection. The package name 'BeautifuoSoup' is a typo-squatting variant of a popular package, which is a known tactic for supply chain attacks. The setup script triggers this code execution automatically during installation without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of external dependencies ('requests' and 'fernet') only in the install hook further suggests they are used to facilitate malicious network communication or decryption of payloads. The obfuscated class name and description strings add to the concealment of intent. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious Python packages, including arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscated payloads, and use of cryptography to hide malicious code."
