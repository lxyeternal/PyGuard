      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute arbitrary code during installation without user consent. The run() method checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. The use of encrypted payload and exec() in the install hook is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling stealthy execution of malicious code during package installation. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. The setup script also specifies suspicious dependencies ('fernet', 'requests') and targets only Windows OS, consistent with targeted malicious behavior. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as code execution at install time, encrypted payload execution, and use of dynamic imports and exec(), confirming the code is malicious."
