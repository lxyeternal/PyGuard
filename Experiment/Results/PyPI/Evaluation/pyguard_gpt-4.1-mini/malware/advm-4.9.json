      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist before launching this hidden PowerShell process, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. Such behavior is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for downloading or executing further malicious payloads, persistence, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution in the same script strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malicious package installation vector."
