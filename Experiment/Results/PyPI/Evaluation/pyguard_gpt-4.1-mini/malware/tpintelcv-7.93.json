      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The execution of an encoded PowerShell command in a hidden window without user consent or notification, embedded in a setup script, is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery. The rest of the setup.py code appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution during package installation, stealth execution, and use of encoded PowerShell commands."
