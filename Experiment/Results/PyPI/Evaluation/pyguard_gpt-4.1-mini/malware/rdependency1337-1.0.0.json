      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. It performs the following suspicious and malicious actions without user consent or interaction: 1) It executes a shell command to overwrite the user's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file with a hardcoded SSH public key, effectively adding a backdoor SSH access for the attacker. 2) It collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username. 3) It sends this collected sensitive system information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-standard external domain (oastify.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction detection and can be controlled by an attacker for data exfiltration. 4) The malicious behavior is embedded in the setuptools install command hook, which means it triggers automatically during package installation, without user awareness or consent. These actions match multiple critical risk indicators such as execution of shell commands during install, exfiltration of system information to a hardcoded suspicious URL, modification of sensitive user files (~/.ssh/authorized_keys), and lack of legitimate application logic or user interaction. Therefore, this code is malicious and poses a serious security threat."
