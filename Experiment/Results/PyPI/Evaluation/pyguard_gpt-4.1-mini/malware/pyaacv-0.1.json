      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary shell commands during package installation without user consent or notification. Specifically, it downloads an executable file (CBLines.exe) from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe) directly into the current working directory. After downloading, it immediately executes this file using PowerShell's Start-Process. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. The lack of validation, user interaction, or integrity checks on the downloaded executable, combined with the execution of an arbitrary binary from an external source, strongly indicates malicious intent. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as executing shell commands during install, downloading and running untrusted code, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and triggering code execution as a side effect of package installation."
