      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade detection and static analysis. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, indicating an attempt to run covertly. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The malicious payload is embedded in the setup script, which means it will execute during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess to run encoded PowerShell commands in hidden mode, combined with obfuscation and silent exception handling, strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at executing unauthorized code on the victim's system."
