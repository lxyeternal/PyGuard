      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. This behavior is typical of supply chain attacks where malicious code is embedded in package installation scripts to execute hidden payloads. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during installation strongly indicates an attempt to evade detection and execute malicious code on the victim's system. Additionally, the package setup metadata is nonsensical and obfuscated, further supporting malicious intent. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) in the install hook suggests potential for network communication or further payload retrieval, although the exact decrypted payload is not visible here. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution during package installation, obfuscation, and encrypted payload execution."
