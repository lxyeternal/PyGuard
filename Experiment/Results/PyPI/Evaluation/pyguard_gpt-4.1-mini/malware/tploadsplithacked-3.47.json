      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The command is executed without user interaction or consent, and the subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or detection. The URL embedded in the comment and the encoded command references a suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com) hosting an executable ('Esquele.exe'), suggesting that the payload likely downloads or executes further malicious code. The entire malicious payload is embedded within a setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute code during package installation without user awareness. The use of try-except blocks that silently pass exceptions suppresses errors and hinders detection. All these factors combined confirm that the code is malicious."
