      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. This decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. The use of an encrypted payload embedded in the setup script, executed during package installation, is a classic supply chain attack vector. The package name 'reqirements' is a likely typo-squatting attempt to mimic 'requirements'. The encrypted payload and the use of requests suggest potential network activity or further malicious actions. The code triggers execution automatically during installation, without any user interaction or validation, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior. This pattern aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution in install scripts, use of cryptography to hide intent, and execution of arbitrary code during package installation."
