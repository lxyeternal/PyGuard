      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64 string that, when decoded, likely contains a PowerShell script that contacts a suspicious external URL (cdnd.discordapp.com) to download or execute further payloads. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens silently without user consent or interaction, and exceptions are suppressed to avoid detection. Additionally, this malicious behavior is embedded within a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing code execution during package installation. The presence of a suspicious author email and package name further supports the malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute a remote payload on Windows systems during installation, which is a critical security risk."
