      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior embedded in the installation process of a Python package. Specifically, the InstallCommand class overrides the install command to execute a base64-decoded payload via exec during package installation. This payload performs the following malicious actions: it checks for the existence of a specific Windows system path related to the Start Menu Programs folder, creates a directory if it does not exist, writes a PowerShell script to a .vbs file in that directory, and executes this script with hidden window style. The PowerShell script appears to set up a hidden shell environment. Additionally, it downloads and writes a file named 'bitsadmin /transfer mydownloadjob /download /priority FOREGROUND' from a suspicious URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1152716280571375626/1249682250782478396/build_1.exe?ex=666830ca&is=6666df4a&hm=8b5329d678ac043154f656dc917956a923ec59125b0ce4d00a2436665a842db3) to the same directory and executes it. This sequence is a classic supply chain attack vector: arbitrary code execution during package installation, downloading and executing a remote payload without user consent, and running hidden shell commands. The use of base64 encoding to hide the payload, execution of shell commands, writing to system directories, and fetching executables from a Discord CDN URL are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk patterns such as arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscated payload execution, remote payload retrieval, and stealthy process spawning. Therefore, this code is malicious."
