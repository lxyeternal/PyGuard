      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable binary from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://rentry.co/2sv84/raw) without any user interaction or consent. It constructs a path in the user's AppData Local Temp directory to save the binary as 'Bin.exe', then immediately executes it using os.system with the 'start' command, which launches the executable. The entire process is run in a separate thread to evade detection and possibly run in the background. This pattern—fetching a remote executable from a non-standard URL, saving it to a user-specific temporary directory, and executing it without validation or notification—is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The absence of error handling, user prompts, or integrity checks further supports the malicious nature. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
