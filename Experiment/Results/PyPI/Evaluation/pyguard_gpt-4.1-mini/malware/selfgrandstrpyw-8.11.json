      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The URL embedded in the encoded command points to a suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com) hosting a file named 'Esquele.exe', suggesting it downloads or executes a potentially malicious executable. The presence of this code inside a setup script (distutils.core.setup) suggests it is designed to execute during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. All these factors combined—hidden execution, encoded PowerShell payload, suspicious external URL, execution during installation, and suppression of errors—are hallmark signs of malware."
