      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover, with generic package metadata and no legitimate build logic. The combination of executing an obfuscated PowerShell command in a hidden window during package setup, with no user interaction or notification, is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malware. This code is designed to run malicious payloads stealthily during installation, which can lead to unauthorized code execution, persistence, or further payload delivery."
