      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily extract sensitive authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers (Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome) for the domain 'roblox.com' without user consent. It then validates the stolen cookie and, if valid, collects detailed user account information including user ID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, and premium status by querying Roblox APIs. It also retrieves the victim's public IP address. All this sensitive information, including the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie itself, is exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint not related to the legitimate application. The code uses no user interaction or consent before performing these actions, and it suppresses exceptions silently during cookie extraction to avoid detection. The presence of os.system calls (though minimal here) and the hardcoded webhook for data exfiltration further confirm malicious intent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for information-stealing malware, including credential theft, data exfiltration, and unauthorized network communication to attacker-controlled infrastructure."
