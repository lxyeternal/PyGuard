      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) that appears unrelated to the package's stated purpose and is likely used to download or execute a malicious payload. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which may be an evasion or staging technique. This execution occurs during the package setup process, which is a common supply chain attack vector to run malicious code upon installation without user consent. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, combined with the suspicious external URL and obfuscation, strongly indicates malicious intent."
