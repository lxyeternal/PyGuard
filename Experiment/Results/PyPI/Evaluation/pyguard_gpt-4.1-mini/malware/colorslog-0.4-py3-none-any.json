      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a Discord token stealer and exfiltrator. It enumerates multiple Discord and Chromium-based browser directories on a Windows system to locate stored Discord tokens. It decrypts these tokens using Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData) and the Chrome master key. It then validates the tokens by querying Discord's API for user information, including email, phone, Nitro subscription status, and MFA settings. The script collects system information such as IP address, PC username, and computer name. All this sensitive information, including the stolen tokens, is formatted and sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating user credentials and system data to an attacker-controlled server. The code operates without user consent or interaction, uses hardcoded suspicious endpoints, performs credential theft, and data exfiltration, which are hallmark behaviors of malicious software."
