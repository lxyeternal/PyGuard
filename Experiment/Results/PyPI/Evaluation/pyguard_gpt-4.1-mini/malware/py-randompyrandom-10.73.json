      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The command is triggered conditionally if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests staging or persistence behavior. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to legitimate package sources. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of malicious payloads during package installation. The subprocess call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, use of encoded PowerShell commands, and execution during package setup, all of which are hallmark behaviors of malware."
