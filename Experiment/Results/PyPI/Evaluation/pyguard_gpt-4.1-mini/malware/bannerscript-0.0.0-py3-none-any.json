      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file (jjz.exe) from a hardcoded, suspicious URL hosted on Discord's CDN, writes it to a newly created directory named 'data' in the current working directory, executes the downloaded executable immediately using os.system, and then deletes the executable file. This sequence matches multiple critical risk indicators: downloading and executing untrusted code without user consent or validation, use of a hardcoded external URL for payload retrieval, writing and running a potentially malicious executable, and self-deleting the payload to evade detection. There is no legitimate application logic, user interaction, or error handling present. These behaviors are classic hallmarks of malware delivery and execution, indicating that the code is malicious."
