      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or persistence tactic. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The execution of encoded PowerShell commands in a setup script context (during package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system. The use of subprocess with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during package installation without user consent, which is a hallmark of malware."
