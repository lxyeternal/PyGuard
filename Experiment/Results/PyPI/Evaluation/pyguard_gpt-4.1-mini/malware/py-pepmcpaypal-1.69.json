      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or analysis. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The rest of the setup call appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, use of suspicious directory checks, and lack of user interaction or notification strongly classifies this code as malicious."
