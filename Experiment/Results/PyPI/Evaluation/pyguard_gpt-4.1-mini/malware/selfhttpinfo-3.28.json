      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and not related to legitimate Python packages. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command is a common malware pattern to execute hidden payloads. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a package named 'selfhttpinfo' with a suspicious author and description that does not match the actual behavior, indicating an attempt to disguise malicious code within a package installation script. The entire try-except blocks suppress exceptions, which is typical in malware to avoid detection or errors during execution. Overall, this code is designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell payload during package installation without user consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware."
