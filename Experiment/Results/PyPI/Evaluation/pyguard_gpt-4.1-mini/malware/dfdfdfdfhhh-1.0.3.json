      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior embedded in the installation process of a Python package. Specifically, the CustomInstallCommand class overrides the install command to execute a base64-decoded payload during package installation. This payload performs multiple malicious actions: it checks for the existence of a specific Windows Start Menu path, creates directories, writes multiple files with suspicious names and extensions (.vbs, .bat, .pyw) into user directories, and executes shell commands that download and run files from hardcoded, suspicious URLs (e.g., https://api-hw.com/dl/runtime, https://api-hw.com/dl/w, https://api-hw.com/dl/). The commands include running scripts with administrative privileges, transferring files, and starting processes in hidden windows, all without user consent or interaction. The use of base64 encoding to hide the payload, execution of shell commands during installation, writing and running files from user directories, and downloading executables from external servers are classic indicators of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The package masquerades as a benign urllib-like library but executes arbitrary code on installation, which is a critical security risk."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module named 'dfdfdfdfhhh.requester' which is a suspicious, non-standard, and obfuscated package name that resembles typosquatting or an attempt to hide malicious intent. The imported function 'send' is likely intended for network communication. The code does not show any legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the import from such a suspicious module strongly suggests malicious behavior such as unauthorized data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The lack of any other context or benign usage patterns, combined with the obfuscated module name, aligns with known indicators of malicious code."
