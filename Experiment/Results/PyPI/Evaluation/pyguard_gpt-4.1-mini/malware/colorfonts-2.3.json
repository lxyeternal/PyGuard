      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command via os.system that downloads an executable file (colorfonts.exe) from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://download1519.mediafire.com/48azq8vma2ig/ucjpj0vlusw8z06/colorfonts.exe) without any user interaction or consent. It saves the file directly to disk and immediately executes it. This pattern of downloading and running an executable from an untrusted external source without validation or notification is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The use of a hardcoded URL from a file hosting service (mediafire.com) further increases suspicion, as it is commonly abused for hosting malicious payloads. The code suppresses any exceptions silently, which is typical in malicious code to avoid detection. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent surrounding this network and execution activity. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
