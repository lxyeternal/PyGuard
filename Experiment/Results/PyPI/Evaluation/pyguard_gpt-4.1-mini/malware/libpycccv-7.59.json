      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded command is base64-encoded and executed without user consent or interaction, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or detection. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The malicious payload is embedded within what appears to be a setup script for a Python package, abusing the installation process to trigger code execution, a common supply chain attack vector. The use of try-except blocks suppresses any errors, further hiding malicious activity. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution, suspicious directory checks, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
