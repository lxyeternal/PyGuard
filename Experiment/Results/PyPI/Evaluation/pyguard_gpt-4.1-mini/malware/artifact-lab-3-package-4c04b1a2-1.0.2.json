      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects all environment variables from the host system and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL hosted on ngrok.app, which is a common service used for exposing local servers to the internet. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity: unsolicited collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data without user consent or interaction, use of a hardcoded suspicious external endpoint for data transmission, and absence of legitimate application logic or user notification around this network activity. Such environment variable exfiltration is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware or reconnaissance stages of an attack. Therefore, this code is considered malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that, immediately upon package installation, collects all environment variables from the host system and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (an ngrok domain). This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment information without user consent or notification. The use of a custom install command to trigger this network communication during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector. The hardcoded external URL is suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package repository or service. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including environment variable harvesting, immediate network exfiltration on install, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and execution of payload during package installation without user interaction."
