      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the legitimate purpose of the package. The malicious code is embedded in the setup script, which means it will run during package installation without user consent, a common supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, combined with the lack of error handling and silent exception suppression, further confirms the intent to execute malicious payloads covertly. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during installation, which is a hallmark of malware."
