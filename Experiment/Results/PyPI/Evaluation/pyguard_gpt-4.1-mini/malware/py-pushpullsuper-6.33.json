      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the process window. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure persistence. The URL embedded in the encoded command points to a suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com) hosting an executable named 'Esquele.exe', which is likely a malicious payload. The presence of this code inside a setup script (using distutils.core.setup) suggests it is designed to execute during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The entire block is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses all exceptions, which is typical for malware to avoid detection and failure logs. These factors combined—hidden execution, obfuscated payload, suspicious external URL, execution during installation, and silent failure handling—are definitive indicators of malicious intent."
