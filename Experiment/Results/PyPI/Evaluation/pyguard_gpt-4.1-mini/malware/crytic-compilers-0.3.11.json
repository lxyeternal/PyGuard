      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a subprocess command during package installation without user interaction or consent. Specifically, it uses exec() to run subprocess.run() on a file named 's.exe' located via an absolute path, but only on Windows platforms. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a known high-risk pattern for supply chain attacks and malware delivery. The use of exec() on a dynamically constructed string to run an executable during setup is suspicious and not typical for benign packages. There is no validation, error handling, or user notification around this execution, increasing the risk. The executable 's.exe' is not a standard or documented part of the legitimate 'crytic-compile' package, suggesting potential hidden or malicious payload delivery. Overall, this pattern aligns with critical risk indicators for malicious code embedded in package installation scripts."
