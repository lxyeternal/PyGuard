      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens silently without user consent or interaction, and the subprocess is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The presence of this encoded PowerShell command in a setup script (commonly run during package installation) strongly suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload. These factors combined match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation without user consent."
