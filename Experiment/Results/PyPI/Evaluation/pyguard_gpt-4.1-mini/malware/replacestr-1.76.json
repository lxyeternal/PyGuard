      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common method to evade static detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist before launching this hidden PowerShell process, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens immediately upon import or setup, without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script. Such behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware that executes payloads during package installation. The use of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell commands run in hidden windows, combined with silent exception handling, strongly indicates malicious intent."
