      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, allowing attackers to run arbitrary malicious code during package installation. The package name 'Matplottib' is a typo-squatting variant of the legitimate 'matplotlib' package, which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The use of obfuscated class names and meaningless description strings further indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, encrypted malicious code during installation on Windows systems, representing a high-risk supply chain attack."
