      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (PostInstallCommand) that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute a reverse shell immediately after installation. The reverse_shell function creates a TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (49.233.121.53) on port 54 (decoded from base64), duplicates the socket file descriptor to standard input, output, and error (os.dup2 calls), and then spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i). This behavior enables an attacker to gain remote command execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The reverse shell is triggered automatically during the package installation process, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of base64 encoding to hide the IP and port, the immediate spawning of a shell, and the network connection to a hardcoded external IP are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network and shell execution activity. Therefore, this code is malicious."
