      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or analysis environments. The presence of a suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. The execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command in a hidden window during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution without user consent or awareness."
