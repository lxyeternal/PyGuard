      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute additional code during installation without user consent. The run() method checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using exec() on data decrypted by Fernet with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a strong indicator of arbitrary code execution and supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class names and encrypted payload hides the true intent, which is typical for malware. The code executes this payload silently during installation, which can lead to remote code execution, payload delivery, or further malicious actions on the victim system. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution during install, obfuscation, use of cryptography to hide payload, and execution of decrypted code via exec(), all of which are hallmark signs of malicious activity."
