      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command is a classic malware behavior to execute hidden payloads without user consent or interaction. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload execution. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical to avoid detection. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute an obfuscated PowerShell payload during package installation without user consent, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
