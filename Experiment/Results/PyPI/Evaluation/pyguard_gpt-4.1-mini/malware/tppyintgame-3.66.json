      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, further hiding the execution window. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The URL embedded in the encoded command points to a suspicious domain (cdn.discordapp.com) and a path that looks like it downloads or executes a file named 'Esquele.exe', indicating a likely payload download and execution. This behavior is triggered during the setup process of a Python package, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The entire malicious execution is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, a common tactic to avoid detection and error reporting. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is used as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Based on the extensive knowledge points, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
