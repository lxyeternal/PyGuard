      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during the setup script execution is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The rest of the setup code appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload execution. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, encoded PowerShell commands, execution during package installation, and obfuscation, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
