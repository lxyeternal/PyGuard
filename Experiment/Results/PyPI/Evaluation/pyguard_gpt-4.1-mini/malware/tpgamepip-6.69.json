      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the stated package purpose. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell encoded command is a known malware tactic to run hidden payloads without user consent or interaction. This code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a decoy or cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, conditional execution based on environment, and embedding malicious behavior in a package setup script, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
