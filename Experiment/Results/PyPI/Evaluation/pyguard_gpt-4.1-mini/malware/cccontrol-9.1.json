      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist before launching this hidden PowerShell process, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens during the import or setup phase without user interaction or consent, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malware embedded in installation scripts. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. The combination of hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands, lack of error handling, and execution triggered during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
