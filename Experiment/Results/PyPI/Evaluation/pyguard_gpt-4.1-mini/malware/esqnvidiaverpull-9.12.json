      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands used to evade detection. The command references a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) that appears unrelated to the package's stated purpose, indicating a likely attempt to download or execute a malicious payload. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which may be a persistence or evasion tactic. This execution occurs during the setup process, which is a common supply chain attack vector to run malicious code during package installation without user consent. The package metadata and naming ('esqnvidiaverpull', 'modlib', author 'EsqueleSquad') appear generic or obfuscated, further suggesting malicious intent. The use of try-except blocks that silently suppress all exceptions also indicates an attempt to avoid detection or error reporting. Overall, the combination of hidden PowerShell execution with an encoded command, suspicious external URL, execution during package setup, and obfuscation strongly classifies this code as malicious."
