      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) are suspicious and unrelated to the package description, which is a decoy. The setup() call appears to be a cover to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installation script. The combination of executing an obfuscated PowerShell command in a hidden window during package setup, without user consent or interaction, is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, obfuscated payloads, execution during installation, and use of suspicious domains and emails."
