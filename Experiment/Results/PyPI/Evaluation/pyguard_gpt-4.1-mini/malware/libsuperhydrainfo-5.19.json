      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. This is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used by malware to evade detection. The encoded PowerShell command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or analysis environments. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with shell=False but passing a PowerShell command string is unusual and likely intended to run the encoded payload silently. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. The presence of this hidden, encoded PowerShell execution in a setup script strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, encoded payloads, execution during package setup, and lack of user interaction or notification."
