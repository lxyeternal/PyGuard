      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads or executes content from a suspicious, non-standard URL (cdndiscardapp.com) unrelated to the stated package purpose. This execution happens conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating staging or evasion behavior. The subprocess.Popen call uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The package metadata and author information appear suspicious and unrelated to the actual behavior. The combination of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and network activity to a suspicious domain strongly classifies this code as malicious."
