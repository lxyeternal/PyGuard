      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses base64 decoding combined with marshal.loads to deserialize and execute a bytecode object dynamically via exec. This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the code and evade static analysis. The embedded base64 string decodes to marshaled Python bytecode, which is then executed immediately, indicating arbitrary code execution from an obfuscated source. Such behavior is strongly associated with malware, as it allows attackers to conceal payloads and execute malicious actions without user consent or transparency. The use of marshal and base64 in this manner is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent, consistent with known malware patterns that perform remote code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
