      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It embeds network communication within a setuptools post-install hook, which triggers automatically upon package installation without user interaction or consent. The createfile() function collects detailed system information, including OS details and the machine's IP address, and sends this data via a raw TCP socket to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 80. This behavior is consistent with system fingerprinting and data exfiltration. The use of a hardcoded IP address rather than a legitimate domain, combined with the lack of any legitimate application logic or user notification, strongly suggests malicious intent. Executing network communication during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no error handling or logging, and the data sent includes potentially sensitive system information. These factors collectively indicate that the code is designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate system information to a remote server, which is a hallmark of malware."
