      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command in a Python package setup script. During installation, it imports the 'requests' module and collects all environment variables from os.environ. It then sends these environment variables via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://a5gpivpedls2wjfxl0bm6dmwenke84wt.oastify.com) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes unauthorized exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data during package installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of a non-standard, suspicious domain for data exfiltration, combined with the execution of network communication during install time without user notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including environment variable harvesting, data exfiltration to a hardcoded suspicious endpoint, and execution of code during package installation (a known supply chain attack vector)."
