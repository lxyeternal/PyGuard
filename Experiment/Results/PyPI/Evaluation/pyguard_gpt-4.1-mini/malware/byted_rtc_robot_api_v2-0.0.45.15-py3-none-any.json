      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information (OS name and release, current working directory, hostname) and immediately sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL constructed using the local hostname concatenated with a non-standard, obfuscated domain (zkecscnceogkcofvfnoqhyc1gg3hf6aqe.22.ax). This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk indicators of malicious activity, including unsolicited collection and exfiltration of environment and system data to an external, suspicious domain without user interaction or consent. The use of socket.gethostname() in constructing the URL and sending potentially sensitive system information externally is a hallmark of information-stealing or staging malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, and the domain is non-standard and likely attacker-controlled. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration and system fingerprinting malware."
