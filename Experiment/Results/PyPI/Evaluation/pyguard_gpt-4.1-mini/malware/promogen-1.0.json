      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential and information stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and other sensitive data. It collects user environment information such as IP address, username, and geolocation, then exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData) and AES decryption, extracts Discord tokens from various local storage paths, and uploads stolen tokens along with user info, billing details, and friends list to the attacker's webhook. It also collects and uploads browser cookies and passwords, zips wallet and gaming-related data, and uploads files from user directories matching sensitive keywords. The code runs automatically without user consent, uses threading to evade detection, kills browser and Telegram processes to access locked files, and uploads stolen data to anonymous file hosting services. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook, extensive credential harvesting, decryption of protected data, and automated exfiltration clearly indicate malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware."
