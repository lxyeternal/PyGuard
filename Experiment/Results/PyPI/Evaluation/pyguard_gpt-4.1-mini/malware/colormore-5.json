      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It silently checks for the existence of specific directories and files related to the Exodus wallet, a cryptocurrency wallet application, without any user interaction or consent. It then collects sensitive wallet files (such as passphrase.json, seed.seco, twofactor-secret.seco, and others) and archives them into a zip file in the user's roaming appdata directory. The script proceeds to gather the victim's public IP address and country code via external HTTP requests, constructs a message including this information, and sends both the message and the zipped wallet files to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, effectively exfiltrating sensitive data to an attacker-controlled Telegram channel. The use of hardcoded Telegram bot credentials, silent exception handling to avoid detection, targeting of sensitive user directories, and immediate network exfiltration without user consent are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including credential theft, data exfiltration, use of hardcoded external endpoints, and absence of legitimate application logic."
