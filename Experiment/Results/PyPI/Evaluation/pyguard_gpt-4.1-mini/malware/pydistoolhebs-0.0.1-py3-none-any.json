      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious credential stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive user data. It collects Discord tokens from various local storage paths of browsers and Discord clients, decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData), and extracts detailed user information including billing info, friends list, badges, and IP/geolocation data. The stolen data is exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL via HTTP POST requests. The code also searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files and folders with keywords related to accounts, passwords, and secrets, uploads them to anonfiles, and reports these findings. It zips and uploads wallet, gaming, and other application data after forcibly terminating related processes to access locked files. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, suppresses exceptions, and performs network communication without user consent or interaction. It installs missing dependencies silently and uses cryptographic decryption to access protected data. All these behaviors—credential theft, data exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints, stealthy operation, and targeting of sensitive user information—are definitive indicators of malicious intent."
