      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a conditional execution pattern often used to avoid repeated infection or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup or import is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the code is a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears benign but is used here as a cover for the malicious payload execution. The absence of error handling and silent exception suppression further supports the intent to evade detection. Overall, this code is highly indicative of malware attempting to execute a hidden payload during package installation or import."
