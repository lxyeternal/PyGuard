      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly obfuscated payload embedded within the custom install command of the setuptools setup script. Specifically, it defines a long obfuscated string and a numeric key string, then reconstructs a decoded string by XORing each character of the obfuscated string with a character from the key string. This decoded string is then executed dynamically using eval(compile(...)). This pattern of obfuscated code execution during package installation is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution without user consent or awareness. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly indicate an attempt to hide malicious payloads or actions. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Executing arbitrary code at install time is a known supply chain attack vector, allowing attackers to run malicious code on the victim's system during package installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
