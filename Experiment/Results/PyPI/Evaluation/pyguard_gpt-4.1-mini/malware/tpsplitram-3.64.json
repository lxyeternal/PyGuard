      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated runs or analysis. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or non-standard source. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during the setup script execution is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload execution. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution triggered during package installation."
