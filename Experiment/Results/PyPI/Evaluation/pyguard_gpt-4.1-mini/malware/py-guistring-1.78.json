      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated PowerShell payloads stealthily. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the payload if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. This execution happens during the package setup process, which is a common supply chain attack vector to run malicious code upon package installation without user consent. The presence of a suspicious domain in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the setup call appears to be a decoy to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. Overall, the use of hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands during installation, conditional directory checks, and obfuscation are strong indicators of malware."
