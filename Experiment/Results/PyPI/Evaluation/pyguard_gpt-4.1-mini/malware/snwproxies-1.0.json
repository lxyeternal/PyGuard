      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious credential stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data. It collects Discord tokens from various browsers and Discord client folders by reading local storage and decrypting encrypted data using Windows DPAPI. It also extracts saved passwords and cookies from Chromium-based browsers by copying and reading their SQLite databases, decrypting stored credentials. The stolen data includes tokens, user information, billing details, friends list, badges, and more. All collected data is exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1075015307749511168/zW0wmO7PoeePt7LvQtnGFt44j1dG2YmJwnzkhKsO5HeRUoQ_2ImSLyoLJP3TlKqGILWA) without user consent. The code also searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files and folders with keywords related to accounts, passwords, secrets, wallets, and uploads them to an anonymous file hosting service, further exfiltrating potentially sensitive files. It uses threading to perform these actions concurrently and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, use of Windows DPAPI decryption to steal credentials, exfiltration of tokens and passwords, and scanning of user directories for sensitive files are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This code is a classic example of a Discord token and browser credential stealer malware."
