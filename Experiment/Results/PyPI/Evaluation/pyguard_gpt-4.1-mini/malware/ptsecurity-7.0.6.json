      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically fetches Python code from hardcoded, suspicious URLs (http://files.pythonhosted.ru/version/check/ptsecurity/ + hostname, and http://files.pythonhosted.ru/56788.txt or 56789.txt depending on platform) and executes it immediately using exec(). This behavior is a critical red flag because it enables arbitrary remote code execution without user consent or validation. The use of the hostname in constructing the URL indicates system fingerprinting and potential targeted payload delivery. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical of malware trying to evade detection. The URLs are non-standard and unrelated to any known legitimate Python package repository, increasing suspicion. The unconditional execution of remote code fetched at runtime is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling attackers to deliver and run arbitrary payloads, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or persistence mechanisms. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior."
