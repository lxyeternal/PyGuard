      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to hide the actual command content from casual inspection. The command is executed conditionally if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests evasion or staging behavior. This execution happens silently without user consent or notification, and the use of hidden PowerShell with encoded commands is a hallmark of malware aiming to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads. Additionally, this malicious behavior is embedded directly in the setup script, which means it will trigger during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the setup code appears benign but serves as a cover for the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
