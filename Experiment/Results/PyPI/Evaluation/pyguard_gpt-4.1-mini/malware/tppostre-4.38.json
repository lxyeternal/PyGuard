      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen in a setup script (which runs during package installation) to execute hidden, encoded PowerShell commands without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and lack of user interaction or notification. Therefore, this code is malicious."
