      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It collects sensitive user data such as browser cookies, saved passwords, credit card information, Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, Minecraft files, and system information (including Windows product keys, hardware UUID, IP address, and geolocation). It decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData) and AES decryption, indicating intent to extract protected credentials. The code also attempts to replace cryptocurrency wallet addresses in the clipboard with attacker-controlled addresses (clipboard hijacking), a known theft technique. It hides its window, modifies startup folders for persistence, kills processes related to Discord and anti-cheat/debugging tools, and injects malicious JavaScript into Discord client files to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data. The stolen data and system info are compressed into zip files and exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is a common C2/exfiltration method. The code performs environment checks to avoid running in virtual machines or on certain blocked users/computers, indicating anti-analysis techniques. It uses threading and asynchronous calls to run multiple stealing and exfiltration tasks concurrently and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. The presence of hardcoded suspicious URLs, extensive credential theft, clipboard hijacking, persistence mechanisms, and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints conclusively classify this code as malicious malware."
