      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that execute a function during package installation without user consent. This function downloads an executable file named 'MCCheat.exe' from a hardcoded, suspicious Discord CDN URL, writes it directly to disk, and then executes it using os.system with environment variable manipulation and process spawning. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. The lack of validation, user notification, or integrity checks on the downloaded executable, combined with the use of a non-standard URL and execution of a potentially untrusted binary, confirms malicious intent. The code abuses the installation process to silently fetch and run a potentially harmful payload, which is a critical risk behavior consistent with malware."
