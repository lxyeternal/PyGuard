      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands. The encoded PowerShell command points to a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) that is unrelated to the stated purpose of the package and is likely used to download or execute a malicious payload. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or target specific environments. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. Additionally, the malicious code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute code during package installation without user consent. The package metadata (author, email) and comments reference 'EsqueleSquad' and a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip), which are not standard or reputable sources. The combination of obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, suspicious external URL, and embedding in a setup script strongly confirms malicious intent."
