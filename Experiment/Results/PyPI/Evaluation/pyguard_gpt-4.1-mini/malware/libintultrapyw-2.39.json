      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure persistence. The domain referenced in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The subprocess.Popen call uses creationflags to hide the window, further indicating stealth. This execution happens during the setup process, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, suspicious directory checks, and execution during package setup strongly classifies this code as malicious."
