      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The domain mentioned in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious or attacker-controlled source. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window, enhancing stealth. This code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. No legitimate application logic justifies this hidden, encoded command execution. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to execute a hidden PowerShell payload, likely for unauthorized actions such as downloading further malware, persistence, or system compromise."
