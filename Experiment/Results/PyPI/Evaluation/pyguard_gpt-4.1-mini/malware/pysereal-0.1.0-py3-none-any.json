      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It includes: \n\n1. Hardcoded Discord webhook URL used to exfiltrate stolen data.\n2. Anti-debugging checks that terminate execution if blacklisted usernames, PC names, HWIDs, IPs, MAC addresses, or processes are detected, indicating evasion of analysis or sandbox environments.\n3. Persistence mechanism via the Startup class that copies the executable to a hidden directory in APPDATA and adds a registry run key to maintain execution on system startup.\n4. SystemInfo class that collects detailed system information including CPU, GPU, RAM, HWID, disk usage, network info, WiFi profiles and passwords, and takes a screenshot, then sends all this sensitive data to the attacker's Discord webhook.\n5. DiscordToken class that extracts Discord authentication tokens from multiple Discord and Chromium-based browser storage locations, decrypts them, validates them, and uploads detailed user information, billing info, guilds, friends, and gift codes to the attacker's webhook.\n6. Browsers class that extracts saved passwords, cookies, browsing history, downloads, and credit card information from Chromium-based browsers, packages them into files, zips them, and sends them to the webhook.\n7. Use of Windows DPAPI decryption (CryptUnprotectData) and AES decryption to extract encrypted credentials and tokens.\n8. Silent exception handling to avoid detection and ensure continued execution.\n\nAll these behaviors—credential theft, system fingerprinting, persistence, anti-analysis, and data exfiltration to a hardcoded external webhook—are hallmark traits of malicious spyware or stealer malware. There is no legitimate or benign use case for this code as it operates entirely without user consent or interaction, targets sensitive user data, and sends it to an attacker-controlled endpoint."
