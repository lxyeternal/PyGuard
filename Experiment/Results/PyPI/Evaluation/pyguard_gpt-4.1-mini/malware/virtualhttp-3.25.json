      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this hidden command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure persistence. This execution happens immediately upon import or setup, without user interaction or consent, embedded in a setup script context, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but is overshadowed by the covert execution of the hidden PowerShell payload. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, obfuscated payloads, execution during package installation, and lack of error handling, all strongly indicative of malicious intent."
