      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malware. The obfuscated class name and meaningless description strings further suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The use of encrypted payload executed during installation, combined with network-related modules, indicates potential for remote code execution, payload delivery, or data exfiltration. This behavior is consistent with critical risk patterns of malicious Python packages that execute arbitrary code during installation, often used in malware and supply chain attacks."
