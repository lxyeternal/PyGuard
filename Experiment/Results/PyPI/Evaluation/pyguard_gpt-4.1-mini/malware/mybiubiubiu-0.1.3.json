      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information such as the current username, hostname, and public IP address by querying an external service (https://enabledns.com/ip). It then packages this data along with Python version and timestamp into a JSON payload and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://123.206.22.33:5000/p/). This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, enabling execution during package installation without user consent. Although some potentially malicious code (writing files with eval strings, opening suspicious URLs) is commented out, the active code still performs environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration silently, suppressing exceptions to avoid detection. The use of a hardcoded IP address for data transmission, absence of legitimate application logic justifying this network activity, and embedding in a setuptools setup script strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance payloads."
