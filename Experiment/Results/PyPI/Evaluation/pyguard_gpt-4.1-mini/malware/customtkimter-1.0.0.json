      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is embedded in the package installation process to execute hidden payloads. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payload, and execution during installation strongly indicates intent to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions. The setup script also specifies Windows as the target OS, and the presence of network-related modules (requests) suggests potential for network communication or further payload retrieval. Overall, this code matches multiple high-risk and critical risk indicators of malicious Python packages."
