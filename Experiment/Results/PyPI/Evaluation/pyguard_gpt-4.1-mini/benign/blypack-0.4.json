      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command ('whoami') immediately upon installation by calling post_install() at the end of the setup script. This means arbitrary code execution occurs as a side effect of package installation without user interaction or consent. Executing os.system commands during package installation is a known high-risk pattern commonly abused in supply chain attacks and malicious PyPI packages. Although the command here is benign ('whoami'), the pattern itself is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it enables arbitrary command execution at install time. Legitimate setup.py scripts rarely execute shell commands directly without explicit user consent or clear business justification. This behavior can be exploited to run harmful commands, download malware, or exfiltrate data during installation, making it a critical risk vector."
