      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes shell commands via subprocess.getoutput during the package setup script without any user interaction or consent. It performs a DNS query to a hardcoded external domain 'install14.api.pygrata.com' using 'dig @1.1.1.1', which is unusual and suspicious as it appears to prepare or verify network connectivity to a non-standard domain. Then it runs 'pip install pygrata-utils -U' to upgrade or install a package dynamically during installation. This behavior is indicative of executing arbitrary commands and fetching code or dependencies from external sources without validation or user notification, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and remote code execution. The silent exception suppression (empty except block) further hides any errors, increasing stealth. The use of subprocess calls in setup.py to perform network operations and install packages dynamically is a known malicious pattern, as it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's system during package installation. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attack techniques."
