      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that downloads a platform-specific binary release of the dbt CLI from the official GitHub repository of dbt-labs/dbt-cli during the package installation process. It uses the GitHub API to fetch release information, selects the appropriate binary asset based on the system platform and architecture, downloads the tar.gz archive, and extracts it into the Python executable's directory. The network requests are made to a legitimate and documented GitHub API endpoint, and the downloaded content is a known release asset for the dbt CLI. There is no obfuscation, no execution of arbitrary or decoded code, no suspicious or non-standard URLs, no exfiltration of sensitive data, no hidden or stealthy behavior, and no use of shell commands or subprocesses to execute downloaded content. The post-install hook is a common pattern in Python packaging to perform additional setup steps. The code includes comments and descriptive variable names consistent with legitimate software. Therefore, based on the provided knowledge points and analysis, this code does not contain malicious behavior."
