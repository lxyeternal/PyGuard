      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes shell commands via subprocess.getoutput during the package setup process without any user interaction or consent. Specifically, it runs a DNS query command ('dig @1.1.1.1 install.api.pygrata.com') and then attempts to upgrade/install a package ('pip install pygrata-utils -U'). This behavior is suspicious because: 1) It performs network operations and package installation during setup, which can be a vector for supply chain attacks. 2) The domain 'install.api.pygrata.com' is hardcoded and not a standard or widely recognized package source, raising suspicion about the intent. 3) The subprocess calls are wrapped in a try-except that silently suppresses all exceptions, which is a common evasion technique to avoid detection or failure notification. 4) There is no legitimate application logic or user consent surrounding these network and execution actions. According to the provided knowledge points, executing shell commands during installation without user consent, especially involving network calls to hardcoded external domains and dynamic package installation, is a strong indicator of malicious intent and a common supply chain attack vector."
