      "malicious_behavior": "The code primarily imports various components from internal modules and a version module, which appears to be part of a package's internal structure. The only potentially suspicious part is the use of subprocess.Popen to run a Python command that imports 'dist_util' from 'shopeeloggingtool'. However, this subprocess call is wrapped in try-except blocks that silently ignore failures, and the commands are simple imports without execution of arbitrary code or network activity. There is no evidence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network communication, file writing, or other typical malicious behaviors. The subprocess calls do not execute shell commands with user input or download and run code from external sources. Overall, the code lacks indicators of malicious intent based on the provided knowledge points."
