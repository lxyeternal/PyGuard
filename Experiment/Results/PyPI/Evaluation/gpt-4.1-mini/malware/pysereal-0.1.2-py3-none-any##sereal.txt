      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a malicious Discord token and browser data stealer. It performs the following harmful actions:\n\n1. **Discord Token Extraction and Theft:** The code searches for Discord tokens stored in various local application data folders for Discord and many Chromium-based browsers. It decrypts encrypted tokens using the system's master key and validates them by querying Discord's API. Valid tokens are collected.\n\n2. **Browser Data Theft:** It extracts sensitive browser data including saved logins (usernames and passwords), cookies, browsing history, downloads, and saved credit card information from Chromium-based browsers by accessing and decrypting their local SQLite databases.\n\n3. **System Information and Screenshot Capture:** The code collects detailed system information such as CPU, GPU, RAM, HWID, user display name, hostname, username, disk usage, network info (IP, MAC, geolocation), and saved WiFi SSIDs and passwords. It also takes a screenshot of the user's desktop.\n\n4. **Data Exfiltration via Discord Webhook:** All stolen data (Discord tokens, browser data, system info, screenshot) is sent to a remote attacker-controlled Discord webhook. This allows the attacker to remotely receive and view the victim's sensitive information.\n\n5. **Persistence Mechanism (Commented Out):** There is a commented-out AntiDebug class that attempts to detect debugging or blacklisted environments and kill certain processes. There is also a Startup class that copies the executable to the AppData folder and sets a registry key to run a batch file on startup, enabling persistence.\n\nOverall, this code is designed to stealthily steal sensitive user credentials and system information, then exfiltrate it to an attacker, which is a clear malicious behavior and a serious security threat.",
