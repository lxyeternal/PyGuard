      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python script to a temporary file that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/97vnn/raw) without user consent or verification. It then attempts to run this script using a modified Python executable name. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper, which fetches and runs potentially harmful code from the internet. Such actions can lead to arbitrary code execution, compromise of the system, data theft, or installation of malware. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate package setup, likely to evade suspicion.",
