      "malicious_behavior": "This code collects sensitive information from the host machine and sends it to remote servers controlled by an attacker. Specifically, it attempts to retrieve AWS IAM security credentials by querying the AWS metadata service (http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/), which can provide access tokens for the instance's IAM role. It also reads local AWS credentials files (~/.aws/credentials), environment variables (.env files), SSH keys (~/.ssh/*), and system environment variables. Additionally, it collects system details such as hostname, username, current working directory, and IP address information. All this collected data is concatenated and saved into a temporary file, which is then uploaded via HTTP POST requests to suspicious external endpoints (http://graph.pygrata.com:8000/upload and http://graphs.pygrata.com/api.php). The code also performs DNS queries with encoded usernames to a subdomain of api.pygrata.com, likely for tracking or signaling purposes. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration of sensitive credentials and system information without user consent, which is a hallmark of malicious spyware or credential-stealing malware. The presence of these actions confirms the code is malicious and poses a significant security risk.",
