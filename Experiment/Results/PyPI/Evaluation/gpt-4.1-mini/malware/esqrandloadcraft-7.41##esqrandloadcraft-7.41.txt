      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to run unauthorized commands or download and execute payloads. The presence of a check for a folder named 'tahg' and the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' suggests an attempt to avoid repeated execution and possibly connect to a malicious domain. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package. Overall, this code is malicious as it tries to stealthily execute potentially harmful PowerShell commands on the host system.",
