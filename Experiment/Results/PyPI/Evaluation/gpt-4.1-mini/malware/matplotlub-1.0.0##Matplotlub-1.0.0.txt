      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior embedded in the custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is decrypted with a hardcoded key and executed via exec(). This means that arbitrary code, hidden inside the encrypted blob, runs silently during package installation, which is a common technique for hiding malicious actions such as downloading further malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The obfuscated class name, meaningless package metadata, and encrypted payload strongly indicate an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden malicious code on Windows machines during installation, posing a security risk.",
