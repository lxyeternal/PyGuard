      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to run unauthorized commands or download and execute payloads. The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' suggests an attempt to avoid repeated execution or detection. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or a way to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installer, but the primary malicious action is the hidden PowerShell execution. This can lead to unauthorized code execution, potential system compromise, and persistence on the victim's machine.",
