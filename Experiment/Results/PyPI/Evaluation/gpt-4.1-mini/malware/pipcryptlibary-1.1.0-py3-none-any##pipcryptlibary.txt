      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple behaviors characteristic of malicious software. First, it installs a large number of Python packages, some of which are commonly used for system interaction, cryptography, and potentially for evading detection or manipulating the system. Then, it attempts to copy the 'Cryptodome' package directory to 'Crypto' in the user's Python site-packages, which is a known technique to bypass certain cryptographic package conflicts or to ensure a malicious cryptographic module is used. The code writes a heavily obfuscated and encrypted Python script (stored as a base64-encoded string decrypted by the 'fernet' module) to the user's APPDATA directory and executes it in a hidden subprocess, which is a common method to run hidden payloads. Furthermore, it downloads a Python script named 'run.py' from a suspicious external URL (https://kekwltd.ru/run.py) and saves it to the Windows startup folder, setting the file attribute to hidden. This ensures persistence by running the downloaded script automatically on system startup. Finally, it attempts to execute this downloaded script immediately in a hidden subprocess. These actions—downloading and executing remote code, establishing persistence, hiding files, and running obfuscated payloads—are typical of malware aiming to maintain control over the infected system, potentially for data theft, remote control, or other harmful activities.",
