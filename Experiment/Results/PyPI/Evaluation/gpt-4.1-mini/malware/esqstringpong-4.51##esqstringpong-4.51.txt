      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor installation attempts. The command references a URL (dl.dropbox.com) and attempts to invoke a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. This can lead to unauthorized code execution, potential system compromise, data theft, or installation of persistent malware. The rest of the code is a seemingly benign Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this code contains hidden malicious behavior designed to download and execute a potentially harmful executable without user consent.",
