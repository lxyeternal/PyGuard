      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command appears to invoke a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) under a path related to 'esquelesquad'. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run a payload silently on the victim's machine. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, which seems to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at silently downloading and executing potentially harmful software.",
