      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' suggests it tries to avoid repeated execution. The decoded command appears to invoke a web request to download or execute a file from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) related to 'dl.dropbox.com' and runs a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden window. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and execute a payload from the internet stealthily, potentially compromising the system. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to facilitate installation. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily downloading and executing a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine.",
