      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. The script is triggered only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution. The decoded command appears to invoke a web request to download or execute a file from 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0' and save it as '~\\WindowsCache.exe', then execute it. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to download and run a payload from a remote server, potentially compromising the system by installing backdoors, spyware, or other malicious software. The use of obfuscation (Base64 encoding) and hidden window execution further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package.",
