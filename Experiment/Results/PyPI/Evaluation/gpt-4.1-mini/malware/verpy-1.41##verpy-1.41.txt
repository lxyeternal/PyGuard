      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently download and run a payload on the victim's machine without user consent or knowledge. The rest of the code is a seemingly benign Python package setup, likely used as a disguise to appear legitimate. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly downloading and executing potentially harmful software.",
