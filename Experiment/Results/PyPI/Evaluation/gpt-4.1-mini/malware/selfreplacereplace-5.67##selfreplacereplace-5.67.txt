      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This PowerShell command invokes a web request to download and execute a file from an external URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as '~\\WindowsCache.exe'. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent or knowledge. The use of obfuscation (encoded PowerShell command) and hiding the window further indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script.",
