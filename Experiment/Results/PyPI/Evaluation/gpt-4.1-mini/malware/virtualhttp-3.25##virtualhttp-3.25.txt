      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to invoking a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently download and run a payload without user consent, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malware infection. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup script, likely used as a disguise or to appear benign.",
