      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to download and execute a potentially harmful executable file from an external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mkd3enun97s8zag/Oxzy.exe?dl=0) using PowerShell commands. Specifically, it uses subprocess to run a PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest command to fetch the executable and then immediately runs it via Invoke-Expression. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor installation scripts that silently download and run unauthorized code on the victim's machine. The executable is saved as '~/WindowsCache.exe', which is a suspicious filename designed to appear innocuous. The code also suppresses errors and hides the subprocess window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), indicating an attempt to avoid user detection. The rest of the script masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, likely to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this code is malicious and poses a security risk by executing untrusted code from the internet without user consent.",
