      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and a package identifier, then encodes this data in base64 and further encodes it as hexadecimal strings. It then sends this encoded information covertly by performing DNS queries via ping commands to a suspicious domain ('.sub.deliverycontent.online') and also sends HTTP POST and GET requests to another suspicious domain ('www.deliverycontent.online'). This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration or beaconing to a command and control (C2) server. The use of multiple methods (ping with crafted subdomains and HTTP requests) to send data suggests an attempt to evade detection or bypass network restrictions. Such actions can compromise user privacy and security by leaking system information to an external attacker-controlled server, which is a malicious activity.",
