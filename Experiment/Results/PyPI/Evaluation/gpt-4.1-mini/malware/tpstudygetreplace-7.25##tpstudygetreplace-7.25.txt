      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor installation attempts. The command references a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and downloads or executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. The presence of the hidden PowerShell execution, the encoded command, and the attempt to avoid detection by checking for a directory named 'tahg' before execution strongly indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute potentially harmful code on the victim's machine, which could lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise.",
