During installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed via 'exec()', which is a common technique to hide malicious code. This behavior indicates that the package attempts to run hidden code during installation, which can be used to perform unauthorized actions such as downloading malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The obfuscation of class names and the use of encrypted payload further confirm the intent to conceal malicious activity. Therefore, this code is malicious and poses a security risk.",
