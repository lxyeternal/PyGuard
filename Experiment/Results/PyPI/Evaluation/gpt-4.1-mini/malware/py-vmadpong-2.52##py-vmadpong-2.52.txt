      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor code trying to execute potentially harmful or unauthorized actions on the victim's machine. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to appear benign. Overall, the hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell command without user consent is malicious behavior that could lead to system compromise, data theft, or unauthorized control.",
