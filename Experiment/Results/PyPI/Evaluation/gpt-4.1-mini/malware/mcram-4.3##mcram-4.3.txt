      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The script checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. The exact decoded command appears to invoke a web request to download or execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a remote URL (dl.dropbox.com). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and execute a payload from the internet without user consent, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily downloading and executing a potentially harmful executable.",
