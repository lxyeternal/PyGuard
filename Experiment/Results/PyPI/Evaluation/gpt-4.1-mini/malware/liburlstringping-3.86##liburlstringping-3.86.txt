      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor code that tries to download or execute additional payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the victim's machine. The use of a hidden window and encoded command is a common technique to evade detection and analysis. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which may be a persistence or anti-analysis mechanism. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate library. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily executing potentially harmful PowerShell commands on a Windows system.",
