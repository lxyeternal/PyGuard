      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution. The encoded PowerShell command appears to invoke a web request to download or execute a file from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) related to 'dl.dropbox.com' and then runs a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently download and execute a payload on the victim's machine without user consent. The rest of the code is a setup script that appears benign but is likely a disguise or delivery mechanism for the malicious payload. Overall, this code is malicious as it attempts to stealthily download and execute potentially harmful software.",
