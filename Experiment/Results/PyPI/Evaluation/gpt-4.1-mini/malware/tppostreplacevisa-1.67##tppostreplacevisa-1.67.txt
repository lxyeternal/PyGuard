      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that try to download or execute additional payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the victim's machine. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs the hidden PowerShell command. The presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands strongly indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the script as a legitimate package, but the primary malicious action is the hidden PowerShell execution which can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise.",
