      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is suspicious and typical of malware or backdoor activity, as it tries to run a potentially harmful or unauthorized script in the background. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate Python package setup call, possibly used as a disguise or to appear benign. Overall, the hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell command without user consent is a clear indicator of malicious intent, potentially allowing remote code execution, downloading further payloads, or other harmful actions.",
