      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install behavior in a Python package setup script. During installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted at runtime with a hardcoded key. This decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which can run arbitrary Python code. Such behavior is typical of malicious code attempting to hide its true intent by encrypting the payload and only decrypting it during installation. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it can execute any code, potentially downloading malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The obfuscated class name, meaningless description strings, and the requirement of 'fernet' and 'requests' packages further indicate an attempt to disguise malicious activity. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden malicious code during package installation on Windows, posing a significant security risk.",
