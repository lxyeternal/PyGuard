      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or connect to remote servers covertly. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the use of a suspicious folder name 'tahg' suggest an attempt to evade detection by only running the command if the folder does not exist. The PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further malicious code from a remote source (the encoded command decodes to a PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest command targeting a suspicious URL). This hidden execution can lead to unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script.",
