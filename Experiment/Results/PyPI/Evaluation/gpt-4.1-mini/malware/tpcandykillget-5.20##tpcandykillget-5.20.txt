      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor scripts that try to download or execute additional payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the system. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The rest of the code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to facilitate installation. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of potentially harmful commands and is therefore malicious.",
