      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that, upon installation, collects sensitive system information including OS details (via 'uname -a' or 'systeminfo'), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP address, current user ('whoami'), and hostname. It then sends this collected data to a remote Slack webhook URL without user consent. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration, potentially compromising user privacy and security by leaking system information to an external party. Such actions are characteristic of malicious code designed to gather reconnaissance data stealthily.",
