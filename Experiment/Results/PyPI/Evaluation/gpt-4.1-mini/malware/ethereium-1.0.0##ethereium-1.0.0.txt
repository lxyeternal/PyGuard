      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior embedded in the custom install command class for setuptools. Specifically, during installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the actual code being run until installation time. This technique is commonly used to evade detection and analysis. The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of encrypted code execution during installation strongly suggests that it performs unauthorized or harmful actions on the victim's machine. The obfuscated class name, random metadata strings, and the use of encrypted execution further support the conclusion that this is malicious code designed to run hidden payloads on Windows systems during package installation.",
