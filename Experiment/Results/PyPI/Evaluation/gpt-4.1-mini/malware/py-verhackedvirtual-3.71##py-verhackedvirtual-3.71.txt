      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. This command is base64-encoded and runs without user visibility (hidden window). The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it executes this PowerShell command. The encoded command likely downloads or executes a payload from a remote server (the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip hints at a malicious source). Running hidden PowerShell commands with encoded payloads is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and silently execute malicious activities such as downloading additional malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears benign but may be used as a decoy or to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily executing a potentially harmful PowerShell payload.",
