      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation command class for a Python package setup script. During installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted at runtime with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows execution of arbitrary code that is hidden from static analysis. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to conceal their true functionality. The code does not reveal what the decrypted payload does, but the pattern of encrypted code execution during installation is a common technique to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions on the victim's machine. Therefore, this code is malicious and potentially harmful.",
