      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor installation attempts, as it tries to run a potentially harmful or unauthorized script in the background. The script also checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not, which may be a persistence or infection marker. The rest of the code is a seemingly benign Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell command that could download, install, or execute malicious payloads, making it malicious.",
