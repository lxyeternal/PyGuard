      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. The presence of the hidden window style and encoded command indicates an attempt to conceal the execution of potentially harmful actions. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious source. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The exact decoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a remote URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0), which is a strong indicator of malware behavior, as it fetches and runs an external executable without user consent. This behavior can lead to system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities. The rest of the code is a typical Python setup script, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate.",
