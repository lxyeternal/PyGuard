      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command passed as a base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip). This behavior is characteristic of malware that tries to download and run a potentially harmful executable without user consent, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware infection. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily downloading and executing a potentially harmful payload.",
