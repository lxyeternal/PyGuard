      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using a Fernet symmetric encryption key. The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it runs hidden code that is not visible in the source. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to run unauthorized code during installation, potentially compromising the system. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution is a common technique to evade detection and analysis. Therefore, this code is malicious as it executes hidden, encrypted code during installation on Windows systems, which could perform harmful actions such as data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation.",
