      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install behavior when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted at runtime with a hardcoded key. This technique is commonly used to hide malicious code from static analysis. Executing decrypted code during installation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge. The use of obfuscated class names, meaningless description strings, and the encrypted payload strongly indicate an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. The exact nature of the decrypted payload is not visible here, but the pattern of decrypting and executing code during install is a hallmark of malware or backdoor installation. Therefore, this code is malicious and poses a security risk by executing hidden code during package installation on Windows systems.",
