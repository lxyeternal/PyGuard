      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This PowerShell command invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com). The execution is done silently without user consent or visibility. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and run a payload from the internet covertly, potentially leading to unauthorized code execution, system compromise, or data theft. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, but the hidden PowerShell invocation is clearly malicious.",
