      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This command appears to invoke a web request to download or execute a file from an external URL (dl.dropbox.com), which is a common technique used by malware to fetch and run additional malicious payloads. The use of a hidden window and encoded command is intended to evade detection and user awareness. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely used as a decoy or to appear legitimate. Overall, this behavior is malicious as it attempts to silently download and execute potentially harmful code from the internet.",
