      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe'. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent. The use of a hidden window and encoded command is intended to evade detection. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. Overall, this code is malicious as it attempts to silently download and execute an external executable, which can compromise system security.",
