      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install behavior when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it executes arbitrary code that is hidden from static analysis. This behavior can be used to run malicious code on the victim's machine during package installation without the user's knowledge. The obfuscation of class names, variable names, and the use of encrypted payload further supports the intent to conceal malicious actions. The exact payload is not visible in the source, but the pattern strongly suggests it could perform harmful actions such as downloading malware, stealing data, or compromising the system.",
