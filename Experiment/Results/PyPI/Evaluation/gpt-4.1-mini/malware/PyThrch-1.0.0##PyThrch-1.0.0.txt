      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for a Python package setup that, when run on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the source code and decrypted at runtime with a hardcoded key. This decrypted code is executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the actual behavior of the code until installation time. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution is a common technique to evade detection and analysis. The exact behavior of the decrypted payload is not visible in the provided code, but the pattern strongly suggests it performs unauthorized or harmful actions, such as downloading additional malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. Therefore, this code is malicious and potentially harmful.",
