      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a malicious Discord token and credential stealer designed to extract sensitive user data from a victim's computer. It targets browsers and Discord clients to steal Discord authentication tokens, saved passwords, cookies, and other sensitive information. The code decrypts encrypted browser data (passwords, cookies) using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption, collects Discord tokens from various local storage files, and gathers user information such as billing details, badges, friends, email, phone, and IP address. It then exfiltrates this data to a remote Discord webhook URL controlled by the attacker. Additionally, it searches common user folders (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files and folders with keywords related to passwords, accounts, wallets, and secrets, uploads these files to anonymous file hosting services, and sends links to the attacker. The script also attempts to kill certain processes to access locked files and compresses data into zip archives before uploading. Overall, the code is designed to covertly harvest and transmit private user credentials and tokens, enabling unauthorized access to victims' Discord accounts and potentially other services, causing privacy breaches, account takeovers, and financial theft.",
