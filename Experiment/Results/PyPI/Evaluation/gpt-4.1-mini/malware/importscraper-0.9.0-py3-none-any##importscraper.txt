      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads and executes an executable file ('neu2.exe') from a remote URL and saves it into the user's APPDATA directory, then runs it. This behavior is suspicious because it fetches and runs a binary from an external source without user consent or verification, which is a common technique used by malware to install or execute malicious payloads. Furthermore, the script checks if Java is installed by running 'java -version'. If Java is present, it downloads another file ('dcbot.jar') from the same remote server and places it into the Windows startup folder, ensuring persistence by running the Java JAR on system startup. This second payload is executed immediately and will also run automatically on future system boots. The combination of downloading executables from an untrusted source, executing them, and establishing persistence strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially for installing malware, backdoors, or bots on the victim's machine.",
