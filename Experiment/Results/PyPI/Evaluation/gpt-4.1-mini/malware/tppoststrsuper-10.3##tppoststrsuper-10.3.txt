      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or connect to remote servers covertly. The presence of a check for a folder named 'tahg' and the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' suggests a connection to a potentially malicious or unauthorized source. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or a way to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installer, while the real intent is to run the hidden PowerShell command. This hidden execution can lead to unauthorized code execution, system compromise, or data exfiltration, making the code malicious.",
