      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that, during installation, downloads a Python script named 'rat.py' from a remote URL hosted on Discord's CDN. This script is saved locally without user consent or transparency. The installer also ensures that 'requests' and 'pycryptodome' libraries are installed, which are commonly used for network communication and cryptographic operations, respectively. Furthermore, the package's entry point is set to execute a 'main' function from 'spamsynonym.rat', implying that the downloaded 'rat.py' script is intended to be run as part of the package's functionality. The use of the filename 'rat.py' strongly suggests that the downloaded script is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), which typically allows unauthorized remote control over the victim's machine. This behavior is characteristic of malicious software aiming to compromise system security, potentially leading to data theft, unauthorized access, or further malware deployment. Therefore, this code is malicious as it downloads and prepares to execute a potentially harmful remote access tool without user knowledge or consent.",
