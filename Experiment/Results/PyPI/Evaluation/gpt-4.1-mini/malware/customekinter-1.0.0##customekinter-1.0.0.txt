      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior embedded in the custom install command class 'yzxXMHRGOvlDIDdPlUZZoGoJtXXbNiTUofHhvvfIUgXTLvlsiWAwJKWQigOQqlv', which overrides the standard setuptools install process. Specifically, during installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is decrypted with a hardcoded Fernet key and executed via exec(). This technique is commonly used to hide malicious payloads from static analysis. The decrypted code is not visible directly, but the use of exec on decrypted data strongly indicates execution of hidden, potentially harmful code. Such behavior can be used to download and execute malware, steal data, or perform other unauthorized actions on the victim's machine during package installation. The obfuscation of class names and meaningless metadata further suggests an attempt to evade detection. Therefore, this code is malicious as it executes concealed code during installation, posing a security risk.",
