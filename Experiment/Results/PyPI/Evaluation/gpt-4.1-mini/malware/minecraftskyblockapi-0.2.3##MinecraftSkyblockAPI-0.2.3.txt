      "malicious_behavior": "This Python script is malicious. It is designed to stealthily extract sensitive user data from a Windows system, specifically targeting Discord tokens, browser saved passwords, and cookies from multiple browsers (Chrome, Brave, Edge, Opera, OperaGX). It locates browser data directories and Discord local storage, decrypts encrypted tokens and credentials using Windows DPAPI (win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData) and AES-GCM decryption, and writes the stolen data into local text files. After collecting this sensitive information, the script attempts to exfiltrate the data by sending the files to a remote Discord webhook URL and optionally to a Telegram bot if configured. This behavior constitutes credential theft and data exfiltration, which can lead to account compromise, identity theft, unauthorized access to user accounts, and privacy violations. The script also deletes the local copies of the stolen data files after sending them, indicating an attempt to cover its tracks.",
