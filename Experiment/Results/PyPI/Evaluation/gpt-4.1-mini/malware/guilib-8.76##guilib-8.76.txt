      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is suspicious and typical of malware or backdoor installation attempts. The script first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs the encoded PowerShell command. The exact decoded command is obfuscated, but the use of hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands strongly indicates malicious intent, such as downloading or executing further payloads, establishing persistence, or compromising the system. The rest of the code is a typical Python setup script, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of potentially harmful commands and is therefore malicious.",
