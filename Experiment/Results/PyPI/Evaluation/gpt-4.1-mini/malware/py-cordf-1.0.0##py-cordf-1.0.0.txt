      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is malicious. It defines a custom installation command (GruppeInstall) that executes during the package installation process on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using a Fernet symmetric encryption key. The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the actual code being run until installation time, making static analysis difficult. The encrypted payload likely contains harmful code such as downloading additional malware, executing arbitrary commands, or compromising the system. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to evade detection by hiding its payload and executing it only in specific environments (Windows in this case). The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution during installation is a common tactic to infect systems stealthily.",
