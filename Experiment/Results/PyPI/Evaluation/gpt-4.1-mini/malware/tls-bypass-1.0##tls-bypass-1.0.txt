      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python script to a temporary file that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/cry6n/raw) without user consent or verification. It then attempts to run this script using a modified Python executable name. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper malware, as it fetches and executes potentially harmful code from an external source, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities. The use of obfuscation by writing the downloader code to a temporary file and executing it indirectly further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
