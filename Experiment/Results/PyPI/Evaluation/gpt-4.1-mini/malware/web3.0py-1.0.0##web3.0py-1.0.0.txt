      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a piece of encrypted Python code using a hardcoded Fernet key. This decrypted code is executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the actual payload from static analysis. The use of encrypted payloads executed at install time is a common technique to evade detection and deliver malicious functionality. The exact behavior of the decrypted payload is not visible in the source, but the pattern strongly suggests that the code is designed to run hidden malicious actions on the victim's machine during package installation, potentially including downloading further malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The obfuscated metadata and unusual package naming further support the suspicion of malicious intent.",
