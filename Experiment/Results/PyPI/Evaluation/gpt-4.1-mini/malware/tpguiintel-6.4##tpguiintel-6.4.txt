      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) without user consent. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and run potentially harmful payloads on the victim's machine. The use of a hidden window and encoded command is intended to evade detection by users and some security tools. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate Python package setup call, likely used as a decoy or to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly downloading and executing external code, which can compromise system security.",
