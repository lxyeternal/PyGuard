      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0). This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent. The presence of the hidden window style and the use of encoded commands are common techniques to evade detection. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. Overall, this code is malicious as it attempts to silently download and execute an external executable, which can compromise system security.",
