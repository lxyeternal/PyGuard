      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior embedded in the custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is decrypted and executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of obfuscated malicious intent. This technique is commonly used to hide the true purpose of the code from static analysis. The decrypted payload is not directly visible, but the use of encrypted code execution during installation strongly suggests that it performs unauthorized or harmful actions, such as downloading additional malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The obfuscation of class names, package name ('etherum' instead of 'ethereum'), and meaningless description strings further support the conclusion that this is malicious code designed to evade detection and perform harmful actions on Windows machines during package installation.",
