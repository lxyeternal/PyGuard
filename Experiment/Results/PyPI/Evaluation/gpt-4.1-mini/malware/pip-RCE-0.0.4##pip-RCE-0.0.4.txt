      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is malicious. It defines a Python package setup script that, upon installation, writes and executes a hidden Python script named 'remote-access.py' in the user's home or Documents directory. This hidden script attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote IP address (82.157.252.61) on port 1234. Once connected, it provides the remote attacker with interactive shell access to the victim's machine, either via Windows cmd or a Linux bash shell, depending on the platform. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely, effectively compromising the victim's system security and privacy. The code uses threading and socket programming to maintain the connection and redirect input/output streams, making it a classic example of a reverse shell backdoor embedded in a seemingly benign package installation process.",
