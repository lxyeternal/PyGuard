      "malicious_behavior": "This code collects potentially sensitive user data from specific configuration files related to Minecraft and Lunar Client accounts, which may contain user credentials or authentication tokens. It then sends this data to a remote server via a webhook URL that is dynamically retrieved from a base64-encoded URL (https://bit.ly/3OqeFUn). The use of a webhook to exfiltrate files without user consent indicates data theft behavior. The code targets files that likely contain account information, which can be used for account hijacking or unauthorized access. Overall, this behavior constitutes malicious data exfiltration and privacy violation.",
