      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is suspicious and typical of malware or backdoor activity, as it tries to run a hidden process potentially to download or execute further malicious payloads. The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' (which appears to be a suspicious or malicious domain) further supports the malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily execute a hidden PowerShell command that could compromise the system.",
