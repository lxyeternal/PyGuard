      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to run unauthorized commands or download and execute payloads covertly. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs the hidden PowerShell command. The exact decoded command appears to invoke a web request to download or execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a remote URL (dl.dropbox.com), which is a common vector for malware distribution. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a strong indicator of malicious intent, aiming to evade detection and run potentially harmful code on the victim's machine.",
