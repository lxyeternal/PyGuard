During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. This decrypted code is executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the actual payload from static analysis and executes arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. The purpose of this behavior is likely to run hidden malicious code on Windows systems when the package is installed, potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as data theft, system compromise, or persistence mechanisms. The obfuscation of class names, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during install are common tactics used by malware to evade detection.",
