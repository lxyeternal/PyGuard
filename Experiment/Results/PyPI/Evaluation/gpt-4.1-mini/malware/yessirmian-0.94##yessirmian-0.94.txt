      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that, when the package is installed, sends the hostname and IP address of the machine to a remote Discord webhook URL. This behavior effectively leaks potentially sensitive information about the user's system to a third party without user consent. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the data sent could be used for tracking, reconnaissance, or other malicious purposes. This kind of data exfiltration during installation is a common tactic in malicious packages to gather information about infected hosts.",
