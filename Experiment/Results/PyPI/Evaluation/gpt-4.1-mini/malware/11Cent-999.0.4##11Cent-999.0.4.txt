      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that, upon installation, collects directory listings from sensitive system locations such as '/', '/root/', '/home/', and '/root/.ssh/'. It attempts to create a file '/root/j0j0.poc' likely as a marker or to check permissions. The collected directory listings are then sent via an HTTP POST request to a remote server at 'https://j0j0.xyz/lists/'. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration, potentially leaking sensitive information about the target system's file structure and contents to an attacker-controlled server. Such actions are characteristic of malicious software designed to gather intelligence or prepare for further exploitation.",
