      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. This encoded command is base64-encoded and runs without user knowledge or consent. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution. The use of a hidden window and encoded command is a common technique to conceal malicious activity. The exact payload of the encoded command is not directly visible, but the context and method strongly indicate it is designed to perform unauthorized or harmful actions on the system, such as downloading or executing malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The rest of the code is a setup script that appears legitimate but is likely a decoy or a way to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this code contains hidden malicious behavior aimed at executing a concealed PowerShell payload on Windows systems.",
