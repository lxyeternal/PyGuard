      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The script checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor installation attempts, as it tries to run potentially harmful or unauthorized code in the background without user consent. The presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands further indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears benign but is likely a cover or part of the malware distribution. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute potentially harmful commands on a Windows system, which constitutes malicious behavior.",
