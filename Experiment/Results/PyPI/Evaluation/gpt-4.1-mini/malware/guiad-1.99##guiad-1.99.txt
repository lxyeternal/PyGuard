      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor installation attempts, as it tries to run a potentially harmful or unauthorized script in the background. The script checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs the encoded PowerShell command, which likely downloads or executes further malicious payloads from a remote source (the encoded command references a URL 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm...'). This hidden execution and remote code invocation indicate malicious intent, potentially compromising the system by downloading and running unauthorized code without user consent.",
