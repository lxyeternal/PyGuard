      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is malicious. It is designed to execute obfuscated and encoded payloads that perform unauthorized actions on the host system. The code uses base64-encoded strings that are decoded and executed dynamically via exec(), which is a common technique to hide malicious intent. The payload attempts to detect the operating system and then runs different encoded commands accordingly. On Windows (nt), it decodes and executes a large base64 string that appears to perform network communication, file operations, and possibly downloading or executing further malicious code. On other systems, it similarly decodes and executes another base64-encoded payload that includes network requests, file manipulations, and system command executions. The code also includes references to network addresses and ports, indicating potential command and control communication or data exfiltration. The use of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and network activity strongly indicates that this code is intended to compromise the system, maintain persistence, and possibly control or steal data from the infected machine.",
