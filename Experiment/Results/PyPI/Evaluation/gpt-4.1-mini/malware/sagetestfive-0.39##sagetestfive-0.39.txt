      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom installation command that, when run, performs several suspicious actions indicative of malicious intent. Specifically, it creates folders inside the Windows startup directory and another folder named 'Powerpoint' under the user's Start Menu Programs directory. It then clones two GitHub repositories into these folders: one into the startup 'boot' folder and another into the 'Powerpoint' folder. After cloning, it moves a Python script ('test.py') from the cloned repository in the startup 'boot' folder directly into the startup folder, ensuring it will be executed automatically on system startup. Finally, it executes an executable ('main.exe') from the 'Powerpoint' folder. These actions effectively install and run code automatically every time the user logs in, which is a common persistence mechanism used by malware. The repositories cloned have names suggesting keylogging or credential grabbing functionality ('defonotagrabber'), indicating the potential for data theft or spying. The use of the Windows startup folder to auto-run code, cloning external code repositories without user consent, and executing an unknown executable all strongly suggest malicious behavior aimed at persistence and possibly data exfiltration or system compromise.",
