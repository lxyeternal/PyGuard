      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including base64 decoding, string decoding, and dynamic evaluation (eval). It uses obfuscation techniques such as hex-encoded strings, dynamic imports, and execution of decoded bytecode. The code dynamically decodes and executes a large blob of encoded data, which is a common pattern in malicious scripts to hide their true intent and evade detection. Such behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to conceal payloads or malicious logic. The exact payload is not directly visible due to obfuscation, but the use of eval on decoded data and the presence of large encoded blobs strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful operations. This could include unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration, system compromise, or other malicious activities. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious.",
