      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The script is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution or detection. The PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and downloads or executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's temp directory. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and run a payload from a remote server, potentially compromising the system by executing unauthorized code. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script.",
