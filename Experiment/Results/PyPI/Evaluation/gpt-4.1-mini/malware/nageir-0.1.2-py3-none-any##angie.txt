      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL and saves it locally as 'windows.exe'. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using subprocess.run. This behavior is typical of malware or malicious scripts that attempt to fetch and run potentially harmful executables without user consent. The downloaded executable could perform any number of harmful actions such as installing malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. Running an unknown executable from the internet poses a significant security risk.",
