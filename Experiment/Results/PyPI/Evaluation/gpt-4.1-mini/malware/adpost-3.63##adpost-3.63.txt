      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently download and run a payload without user consent, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malicious activity. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate.",
