      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class 'new_install' that registers a function '_post_install' to be executed at program exit (via atexit). The '_post_install' function performs several suspicious actions: it creates/appends a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with the text 'proof bug by kotko', then collects the public IP address of the machine by querying 'https://api.ipify.org', retrieves the hostname via 'os.uname()', and encodes this information along with the current script's directory path into a base64 string. It then sends this encoded data as a GET request parameter to an external URL 'https://kotko.org' with a query parameter constructed from the company and package name concatenated. This behavior effectively leaks potentially sensitive information about the user's environment (IP address, hostname, and installation path) to a remote server without user consent. Such data exfiltration during package installation is a form of malicious behavior, as it compromises user privacy and security.",
