      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious Roblox cookie grabber designed to stealthily extract sensitive authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from the victim's web browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera) using the browser_cookie3 library. It collects these cookies specifically for the domain 'roblox.com', which are used to authenticate Roblox accounts. The script then validates the stolen cookie using robloxpy's CheckCookie function. If the cookie is valid, it proceeds to gather detailed information about the Roblox account associated with the cookie, including user ID, RAP (Recent Average Price), friends count, account age, creation date, username, Robux balance, premium status, and profile URLs. It also fetches the victim's public IP address. All this sensitive information, including the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie itself, is sent to a remote Discord webhook controlled by the attacker. This allows the attacker to hijack the victim's Roblox account, potentially leading to unauthorized access, theft of in-game assets, and privacy violations. The script also attempts to distract the user with a dummy message to avoid suspicion. Overall, this code is designed to steal Roblox account credentials and personal information for malicious purposes.",
