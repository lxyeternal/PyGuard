      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that runs silently without user awareness. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor installation scripts that try to evade detection by hiding their execution window and running potentially harmful commands. The script also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, which may be a persistence or anti-analysis technique. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of potentially harmful PowerShell commands, which is a clear indicator of malicious behavior.",
