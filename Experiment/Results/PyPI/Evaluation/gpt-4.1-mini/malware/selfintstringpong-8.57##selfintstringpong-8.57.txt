      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is only run if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes a payload from the URL 'https://esquelesqt.l.000webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquad.exe' (decoded from the base64 string). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to stealthily download and execute a malicious executable on the victim's machine without user consent or knowledge. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup script, possibly to disguise the malicious payload as a normal Python package. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly executing a remote payload, which can lead to system compromise.",
