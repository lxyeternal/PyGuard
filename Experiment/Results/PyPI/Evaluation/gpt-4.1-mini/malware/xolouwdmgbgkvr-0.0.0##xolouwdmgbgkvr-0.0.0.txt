      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a setup script for a Python package with a suspiciously random name 'xolouwdmgbgkvr' and no author information. It declares dependencies on several packages: 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. Among these, 'browser_cookie3' can be used to extract browser cookies, which may contain sensitive session information. 'discordwebhook' can be used to send data to Discord channels, potentially exfiltrating stolen information. 'robloxpy' is related to Roblox automation, which could be used for account manipulation or automation. The combination of these dependencies suggests the package may be designed to steal browser cookies and send them to an external server via Discord webhooks, which is a common pattern in malware for credential theft and data exfiltration. The lack of author details and the random package name further indicate an attempt to obfuscate the package's true intent. Therefore, this setup script is likely part of a malicious package intended for stealing sensitive user data.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious cookie grabber targeting Roblox users. It attempts to stealthily extract the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie from various browsers installed on the victim's machine using the 'browser_cookie3' library. This cookie is a sensitive authentication token that allows full access to the victim's Roblox account without needing a password. The script then validates the cookie and, if valid, collects detailed information about the Roblox account such as UserID, RAP (Recent Average Price), friends count, account age, creation date, Robux balance, premium status, and profile links using the 'robloxpy' API wrapper and Roblox's mobile API. It also fetches the victim's public IP address. All this sensitive information, including the stolen authentication cookie, is sent to a remote Discord webhook controlled by the attacker. This enables the attacker to hijack the victim's Roblox account, potentially leading to account theft, unauthorized transactions, and privacy violations. The code disguises its activity by printing a dummy loading message to distract the user. Overall, this script is designed to steal Roblox account credentials and personal data for malicious purposes.",
