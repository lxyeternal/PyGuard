      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that runs without user visibility (hidden window). This behavior is typical of malware or unwanted software trying to execute potentially harmful or unauthorized actions silently on the victim's machine. The script first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs the encoded PowerShell command. The exact payload of the PowerShell command is obfuscated by Base64 encoding, but the use of hidden PowerShell execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence mechanisms, or system modifications without user consent. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script.",
