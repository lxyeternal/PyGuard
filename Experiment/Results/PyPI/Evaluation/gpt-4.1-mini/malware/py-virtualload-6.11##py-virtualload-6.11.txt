      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The presence of the hidden window style and encoded command strongly indicates an attempt to run potentially harmful or unauthorized actions on the system. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the use of a suspicious folder name 'tahg' suggest this is part of a malware or backdoor installation routine. This behavior can be used to download, execute, or install malicious payloads, compromise system security, or establish persistence. The rest of the code is a setup script that appears legitimate but is likely a disguise or part of the malware distribution. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly executing unauthorized PowerShell commands on a Windows system.",
