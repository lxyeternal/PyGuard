      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor installation attempts, as it tries to run a potentially harmful or unauthorized script in the background. The script also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of a potentially harmful PowerShell script, which is a clear indicator of malicious behavior.",
