      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run a payload without user consent, potentially compromising the system. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, which appears legitimate but is likely a decoy or a way to disguise the malicious payload execution. Overall, the code contains hidden malicious behavior aimed at downloading and executing a potentially harmful executable from the internet.",
