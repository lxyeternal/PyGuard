      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This PowerShell command invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a remote URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0). The execution is done silently without user knowledge or consent. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and run a payload from the internet covertly, potentially leading to unauthorized code execution, system compromise, data theft, or further malware infection. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate.",
