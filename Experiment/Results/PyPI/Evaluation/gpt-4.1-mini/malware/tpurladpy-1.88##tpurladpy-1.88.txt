      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The script checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. The presence of a suspicious URL comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of encoded PowerShell commands executed silently strongly indicate malicious intent. Such behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that try to download or execute further payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the victim's machine without consent. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to facilitate installation. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of potentially harmful commands and is therefore malicious.",
