      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is decrypted and executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of obfuscated and potentially harmful behavior. This technique is commonly used to hide malicious payloads from static analysis. The use of encrypted code executed at install time can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine, potentially allowing the attacker to run any code, including downloading further malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The package name 'Matplotvlib' is a misspelling of the legitimate 'matplotlib' package, suggesting an attempt to masquerade as a trusted library to trick users into installing it. Overall, this code is malicious as it attempts to execute hidden, encrypted code during installation, which poses a significant security risk.",
