      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This command appears to invoke a web request to a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and downloads or executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. The presence of the hidden window style and encoded command indicates an attempt to conceal the execution of potentially harmful code. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and run additional payloads without user consent, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or unauthorized control. The rest of the code is a typical Python setup script, likely used as a decoy or to appear legitimate.",
