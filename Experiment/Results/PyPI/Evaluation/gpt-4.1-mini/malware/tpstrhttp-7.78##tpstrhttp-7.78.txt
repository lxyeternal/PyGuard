      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. The command references a URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) which suggests it downloads or executes a file from a remote source. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run a payload covertly. The use of a hidden window and encoded command is intended to evade detection and user awareness. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or delivery mechanism. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at silently downloading and executing potentially harmful software on the victim's machine.",
