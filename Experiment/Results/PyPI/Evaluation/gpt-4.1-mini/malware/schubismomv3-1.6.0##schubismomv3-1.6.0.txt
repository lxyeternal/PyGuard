      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior. During installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it silently installs the 'fernet' package using pip without user consent, then writes and executes a heavily obfuscated and encrypted Python script named 'gruppe.py' in the user's APPDATA directory. This script is executed in a hidden, detached process (no console window), indicating an attempt to run code stealthily. The encrypted payload is decrypted and executed at runtime, which is a common technique to hide malicious intent and evade detection. The setup metadata includes suspicious keywords like 'ratting' (commonly associated with Remote Access Trojans) and uses offensive author information, further suggesting malicious intent. Overall, the code is designed to deploy and execute hidden, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine without their knowledge, which is characteristic of malware.",
