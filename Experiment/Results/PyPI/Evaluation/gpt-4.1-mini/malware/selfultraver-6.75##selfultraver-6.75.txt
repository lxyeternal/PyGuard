      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that try to download or execute additional payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the system. The presence of a check for a folder named 'tahg' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' suggests an attempt to avoid repeated execution or detection. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or a way to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installer, further indicating malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily run potentially harmful PowerShell commands on a Windows system, which constitutes malicious behavior.",
