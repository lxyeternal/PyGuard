      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using a Fernet symmetric encryption key. The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the actual code being run until installation time. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to conceal their true functionality and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation. The obfuscated class name, meaningless package metadata, and encrypted payload further suggest an attempt to evade detection. The exact payload is unknown without decrypting the Fernet token, but the use of exec on decrypted data strongly implies malicious code execution, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or system compromise.",
