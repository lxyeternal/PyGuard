      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The encrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the actual code being run until runtime, making static analysis difficult. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to run hidden code during installation, potentially downloading or executing harmful actions on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscated class names, meaningless package metadata, and encrypted payload further supports the conclusion that this code is designed to conceal malicious activity. The exact payload is not visible in the source, but the pattern strongly suggests it could perform unauthorized actions such as downloading additional malware, stealing data, or compromising the system.",
