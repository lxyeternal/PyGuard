During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted at runtime with a hardcoded key. This technique is commonly used to hide malicious code from static analysis. The decrypted code is executed via exec(), which can run arbitrary Python code, potentially downloading further malware, executing harmful commands, or compromising the system. The obfuscated class name, random strings for description fields, and the use of encrypted payload strongly indicate an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The setup script masquerades as a legitimate package but executes hidden malicious code during installation on Windows systems, which can lead to system compromise or data theft.",
