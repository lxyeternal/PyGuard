      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. This command is base64-encoded and runs without a visible window, which is a common technique to hide malicious activity. The decoded command invokes a web request to 'https://github.com/T4hg/ee/raw/master/Stage1.exe' and outputs the response to a file named 'WindowsCache.exe'. This behavior indicates that the script is downloading and likely executing a potentially harmful executable from a remote source without user consent. Such actions are typical of malware loaders or droppers that fetch and run additional malicious payloads, posing risks such as unauthorized system access, data theft, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a setup script that appears benign but is likely a disguise to mask the malicious payload delivery.",
