      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The script checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. The command appears to invoke a web request to a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and downloads or executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and execute additional payloads from the internet without user consent, potentially compromising the system. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, which seems to be a cover or distraction. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily downloading and executing potentially harmful software.",
