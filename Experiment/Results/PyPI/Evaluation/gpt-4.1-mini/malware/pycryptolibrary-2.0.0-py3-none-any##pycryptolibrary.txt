      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a sophisticated malware designed to steal sensitive user data from Windows systems. It performs multiple malicious actions including:\n\n1. **Credential Theft:** It extracts saved passwords, cookies, credit card information, and browsing history from various browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge, Yandex, etc.) by accessing browser data files, decrypting encrypted credentials using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption.\n\n2. **Discord Token Stealing:** It searches for Discord tokens stored in local storage of Discord and other Chromium-based apps, validates them by querying Discord API, and collects user information.\n\n3. **Clipboard Hijacking for Cryptocurrency Theft:** It monitors the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet addresses and replaces them with attacker-controlled addresses to redirect cryptocurrency transactions.\n\n4. **System Information Gathering:** It collects detailed system information including Windows product key, hardware UUID, IP address, geolocation, RAM, disk size, and running processes.\n\n5. **Anti-Debugging and Anti-VM Checks:** It attempts to detect if it is running in a virtual machine or debugging environment and exits if detected.\n\n6. **Persistence:** It copies itself to the Windows startup folder to run on system boot.\n\n7. **Data Exfiltration:** It compresses stolen data into zip files and uploads them to a remote server via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded webhook URL (https://kekwltd.ru/relay). It also sends notifications and data via Discord webhooks.\n\n8. **Process Killing:** Optionally kills processes related to Discord and debugging tools to avoid detection.\n\n9. **File Searching and Uploading:** It searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files with keywords related to passwords, wallets, tokens, etc., uploads them anonymously to a file-sharing service, and reports the links.\n\nOverall, this code is a full-featured information stealer (infostealer) malware targeting Windows users, aiming to harvest credentials, tokens, cryptocurrency wallets, and personal files, then exfiltrate them to an attacker-controlled server. Its presence poses a severe privacy and security risk.",
