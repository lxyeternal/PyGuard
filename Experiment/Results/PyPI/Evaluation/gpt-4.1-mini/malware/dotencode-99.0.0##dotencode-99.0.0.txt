      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that, upon installation, collects sensitive information from the user's environment including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external URL (https://eol6mx6at717hhs.m.pipedream.net/dotencode) without the user's consent or knowledge. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration and can be used for reconnaissance or tracking of the infected system. Such unauthorized data transmission is considered malicious as it compromises user privacy and security.",
