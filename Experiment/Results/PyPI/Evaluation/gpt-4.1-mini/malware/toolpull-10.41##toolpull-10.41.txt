      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command passed as a base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is decoded and executed by PowerShell without user knowledge or consent. The command is only run if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution. The use of hidden execution and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and analysis. The decoded PowerShell command appears to invoke a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a remote URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), which is likely a malicious payload. This behavior indicates the code is designed to silently download and run potentially harmful software on the victim's machine, which is a clear sign of malicious intent.",
