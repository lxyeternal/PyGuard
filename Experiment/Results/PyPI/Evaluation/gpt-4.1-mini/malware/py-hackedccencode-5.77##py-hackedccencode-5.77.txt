      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that try to download or execute additional payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the victim's machine. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, which is a common technique to avoid repeated execution or detection. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, likely to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute potentially harmful commands on a Windows system, which constitutes malicious behavior.",
