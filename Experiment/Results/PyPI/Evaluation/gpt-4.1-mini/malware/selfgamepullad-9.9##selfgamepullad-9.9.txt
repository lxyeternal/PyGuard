      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This command appears to invoke a web request to a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and downloads or executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. The presence of the hidden window style and encoded command indicates an attempt to conceal the execution of potentially harmful actions. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and run additional malicious payloads on the victim's machine without consent, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further infection.",
