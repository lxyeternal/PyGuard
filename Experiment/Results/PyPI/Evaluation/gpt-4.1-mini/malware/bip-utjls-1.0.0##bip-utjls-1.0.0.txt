      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command (GruppeInstall) that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted at runtime with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows execution of arbitrary code hidden from static analysis. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to hide their true functionality until runtime. The purpose of this code is to execute hidden, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine during package installation, which can lead to unauthorized actions such as data theft, system compromise, or further malware deployment. The obfuscation of metadata (random strings for name, author, description) further suggests an attempt to evade detection.",
