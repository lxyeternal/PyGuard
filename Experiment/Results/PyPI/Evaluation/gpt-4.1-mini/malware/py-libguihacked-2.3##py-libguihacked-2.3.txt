      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The script checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious source. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes additional payloads or performs unauthorized actions on the system. Running hidden PowerShell commands with encoded payloads is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute malicious activities such as downloading further malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears benign but is likely a decoy or part of a trojanized package. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily executing a hidden PowerShell payload, which poses a security risk.",
