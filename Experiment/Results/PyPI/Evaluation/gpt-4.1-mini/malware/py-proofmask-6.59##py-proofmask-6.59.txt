      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0). This behavior is characteristic of malware or a trojan attempting to silently download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. The presence of hidden execution, downloading, and running an external executable from an untrusted source confirms malicious intent.",
