      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This command likely downloads or executes a payload from a remote URL (as indicated by the comment and the encoded command referencing a URL 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm...'). The presence of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' and encoded commands is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and run malicious payloads silently. The rest of the code is a setup script that appears benign but is likely a disguise to make the script look like a legitimate Python package installer. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at silently downloading and executing potentially harmful software on the victim's machine.",
