      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class 'new_install' that registers a function '_post_install' to be executed at program exit (via atexit). The '_post_install' function performs several suspicious actions: it creates/appends a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with the text 'proof bug by kotko' (which may be a marker or proof of execution), then it retrieves the public IP address of the machine by querying 'https://api.ipify.org'. It also collects the hostname of the machine and the absolute path of the current script's directory, URL-encoded. These three pieces of information (IP, hostname, path) are concatenated, base64-encoded, and sent as a GET request parameter to 'https://kotko.org' with a query string key composed of the concatenation of the variables 'company' and 'name'. This behavior effectively leaks sensitive environment information (IP address, hostname, and local path) to a remote server without user consent. Such data exfiltration is a common trait of malicious code, potentially used for reconnaissance or tracking infected systems. The code is embedded in the setup.py installation process, meaning it executes when the package is installed, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly collecting and transmitting system information to an external server.",
