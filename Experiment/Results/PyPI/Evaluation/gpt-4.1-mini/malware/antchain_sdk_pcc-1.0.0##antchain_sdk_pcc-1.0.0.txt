      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that, upon installation, collects sensitive environment information such as the hostname, current working directory, and username of the user installing the package. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, potentially for reconnaissance or tracking purposes without user consent. Such actions compromise user privacy and security, making the code malicious.",
