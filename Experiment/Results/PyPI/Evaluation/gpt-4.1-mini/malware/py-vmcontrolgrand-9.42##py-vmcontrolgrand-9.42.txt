      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run a payload from the internet without user consent, potentially compromising the system. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, which appears benign but is likely a disguise to hide the malicious payload execution. Therefore, the code is malicious as it performs unauthorized remote code execution and payload delivery.",
