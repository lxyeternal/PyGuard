      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor code that tries to download or execute additional payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the victim's machine. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common technique to avoid repeated execution. The presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated encoded commands strongly indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the script as a legitimate package, but the hidden PowerShell execution is the core malicious behavior.",
