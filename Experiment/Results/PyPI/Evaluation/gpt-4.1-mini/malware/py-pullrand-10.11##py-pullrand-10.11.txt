      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that invokes a web request to download and execute a file from an external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as '~\\WindowsCache.exe'. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent. The use of a hidden window and encoded command is intended to evade detection and user awareness. The rest of the code is a setup script that appears benign but is likely a disguise or delivery mechanism for the malicious payload. Overall, this code is malicious as it downloads and executes an external executable covertly, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or other harmful effects.",
