      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including base64 decoding, string decoding, and dynamic evaluation via eval. It uses obfuscated variable names and encoded strings to hide its true functionality. The code dynamically imports modules such as 'base64', 'codecs', and 'bytes', and then decodes a large base64-encoded payload. This payload is further decoded and processed through custom decoding functions that manipulate the data in non-trivial ways. Finally, the decoded payload is executed dynamically using eval. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious code that attempts to hide its true intent and evade detection. The purpose of this code is likely to execute hidden or unauthorized operations on the host system, which could include downloading malware, stealing data, or compromising system integrity. Due to the obfuscation and dynamic execution, it poses a significant security risk and should be treated as malicious.",
