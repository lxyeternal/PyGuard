      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or download and run additional malicious code covertly. The script checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs the hidden PowerShell command, which likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further malicious payloads. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of potentially harmful commands and is therefore malicious.",
