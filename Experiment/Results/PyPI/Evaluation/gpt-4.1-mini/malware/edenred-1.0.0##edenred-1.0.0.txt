      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that, upon installation, collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and the username of the user running the installation. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL (https://cdf5rwk2vtc0000c78d0ggz1hqeyyyyyb.oast.fun). This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, potentially for reconnaissance or tracking purposes. The external domain appears to be a dynamically generated or temporary domain often used in security testing or malicious activities. Such data leakage without user consent is considered malicious as it compromises user privacy and security.",
