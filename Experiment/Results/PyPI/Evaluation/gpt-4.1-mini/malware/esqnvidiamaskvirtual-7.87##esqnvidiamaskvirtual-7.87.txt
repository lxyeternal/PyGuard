      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that try to download or execute additional payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the system. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The use of a suspicious domain 'www.esquelesquad.rip' in a comment and the obfuscated encoded command further indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the script as a legitimate package. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of potentially harmful PowerShell commands, which is a clear indicator of malicious behavior.",
