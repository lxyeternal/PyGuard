      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior embedded in the custom install command class for setuptools. Specifically, during installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is decrypted with a hardcoded key and then executed via exec(). This technique is commonly used to hide malicious payloads from static analysis. The decrypted code is not visible directly, but the use of encrypted execution during installation strongly indicates an attempt to run hidden, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine. Such behavior can be used to download further malware, steal data, or compromise the system. The obfuscated class name, random strings in metadata, and the encrypted payload all point to an attempt to evade detection. Therefore, this code is malicious.",
