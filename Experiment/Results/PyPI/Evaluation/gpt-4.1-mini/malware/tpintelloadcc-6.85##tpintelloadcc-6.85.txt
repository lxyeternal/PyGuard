      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com with a query string). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run a payload from the internet without user consent, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malicious activity. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate, but the hidden PowerShell execution is clearly malicious.",
