      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently download and run a payload from the internet without user consent, potentially compromising the system. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely used to disguise the script as a legitimate package. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily downloading and executing a potentially harmful executable.",
