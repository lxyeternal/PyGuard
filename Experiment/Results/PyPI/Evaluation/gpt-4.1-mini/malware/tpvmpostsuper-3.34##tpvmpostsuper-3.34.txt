      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that try to run unauthorized commands or download and execute payloads from the internet. The presence of a check for a folder named 'tahg' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' (which appears suspicious) further suggests malicious intent. The setup() call appears to be a decoy to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installer, but the primary malicious action is the hidden PowerShell execution which can compromise the system by running potentially harmful commands or downloading malware.",
