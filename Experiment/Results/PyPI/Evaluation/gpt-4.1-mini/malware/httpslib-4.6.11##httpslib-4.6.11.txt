      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to download and execute a potentially harmful executable file from an external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mkd3enun97s8zag/Oxzy.exe?dl=0) using PowerShell commands. Specifically, it uses subprocess to run a PowerShell command that invokes a web request to download the executable to a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory and then immediately executes it. This behavior is characteristic of malware or a trojan attempting to silently download and run a payload without user consent. The use of subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suggests an attempt to hide the execution window, further indicating malicious intent. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, which is a common tactic to disguise malicious activity within seemingly benign code.",
