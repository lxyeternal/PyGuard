      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of base64 decoding and string replacements to hide its true functionality. The code imports the base64 module, decodes a large base64-encoded string, and executes it using exec(). The decoded payload itself contains further obfuscated code with repeated string replacements and nested exec calls, which is a common technique used to evade detection and analysis.\n\nSuch obfuscation is typical of malicious scripts aiming to conceal their behavior. The use of exec() on decoded data is a high-risk operation, often employed to run dynamically generated or hidden malicious code. The sheer size and complexity of the encoded payload, combined with the obfuscation techniques, strongly indicate that the code is designed to perform unauthorized or harmful actions.\n\nPotential malicious behaviors could include but are not limited to: executing arbitrary code, downloading and executing malware, stealing sensitive information, creating backdoors, or disrupting system operations. Without fully deobfuscating the entire payload (which is extensive and deliberately complex), the exact malicious actions cannot be precisely enumerated, but the indicators are clear that this is malicious code intended to evade detection and perform harmful activities.",
