      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and a package identifier, then encodes this data in base64 and further hex-encodes it. It then exfiltrates this information by sending it covertly via DNS queries (using the 'ping' command to subdomains constructed with the encoded data) and HTTP requests (both POST and GET) to external domains controlled by an attacker (deliverycontent.online and sub.deliverycontent.online). This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration malware or spyware, as it silently gathers and transmits potentially sensitive environment details without user consent. The use of multiple methods (DNS and HTTP) for data transmission increases the chance of successful exfiltration despite network restrictions. Such actions can compromise user privacy and security, potentially enabling further attacks or unauthorized access.",
