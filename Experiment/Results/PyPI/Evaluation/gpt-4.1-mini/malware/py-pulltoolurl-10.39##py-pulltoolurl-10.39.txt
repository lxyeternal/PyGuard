      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that try to download or execute additional payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the victim's machine. The presence of a check for a folder named 'tahg' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' (a suspicious domain) further suggests malicious intent. The setup() call appears to be a decoy to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installer, while the real payload is the hidden PowerShell command execution. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily run potentially harmful commands on Windows systems, which constitutes malicious behavior.",
