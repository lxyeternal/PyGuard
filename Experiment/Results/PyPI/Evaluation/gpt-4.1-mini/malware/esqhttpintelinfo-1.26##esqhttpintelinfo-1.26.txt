      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) related to 'dl.dropbox.com' with a query string, saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then executing it. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run a payload silently on the victim's machine, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, which appears benign but is likely a disguise to hide the malicious payload execution. Therefore, the code is malicious and poses a security risk.",
