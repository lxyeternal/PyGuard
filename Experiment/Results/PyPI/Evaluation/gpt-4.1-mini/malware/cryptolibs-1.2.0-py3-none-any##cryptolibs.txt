      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a sophisticated malicious software (malware) designed primarily as a credential and data stealer targeting Windows systems. It performs multiple harmful actions including:\n\n1. **Credential Theft:** It extracts saved passwords, cookies, credit card information, and browsing history from various browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge, Yandex, etc.) by accessing their local databases, decrypting encrypted data using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption with extracted master keys.\n\n2. **Discord Token Stealing:** It searches for Discord tokens stored in local storage of Discord clients and browsers, validates them by querying Discord API, and collects user information.\n\n3. **Clipboard Hijacking for Cryptocurrency Theft:** It monitors the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet addresses and replaces them with attacker-controlled addresses to redirect cryptocurrency transactions.\n\n4. **System Information Gathering:** It collects detailed system information including Windows product key, hardware UUID, IP address, geolocation, RAM, disk size, and running processes.\n\n5. **Anti-Debugging and Anti-VM Checks:** It attempts to detect if it is running in a virtual machine or debugging environment and exits if detected to avoid analysis.\n\n6. **Persistence Mechanism:** It copies itself to the Windows startup folder to run on system boot.\n\n7. **Process Killing:** Optionally kills Discord and related processes to prevent interference.\n\n8. **Data Exfiltration:** It compresses stolen data into zip files and uploads them to a remote server controlled by the attacker via HTTP POST requests to URLs like \"https://kekwltd.ru/relay\" and \"https://transfer.sh/\".\n\n9. **Spreading and Covering Tracks:** It modifies BetterDiscord files to remove webhook URLs, attempts to disable Discord token protection software, and sends notifications to attacker-controlled webhooks.\n\n10. **Searches User Directories:** It scans user Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders for files with keywords related to passwords, wallets, tokens, and uploads them.\n\nOverall, this code is a fully featured Windows credential stealer and spyware with capabilities to harvest sensitive user data, hijack cryptocurrency transactions, maintain persistence, evade detection, and exfiltrate data to attacker-controlled servers. Its presence on a system poses a severe security and privacy risk.",
