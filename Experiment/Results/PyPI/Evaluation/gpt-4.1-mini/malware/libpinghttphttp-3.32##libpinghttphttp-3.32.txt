      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor installation scripts that try to download or execute additional payloads from a remote server. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious source. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating an attempt to avoid repeated execution. The setup() call appears to be a decoy to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installer. Overall, this code is malicious as it tries to stealthily execute potentially harmful PowerShell commands that could compromise the system.",
