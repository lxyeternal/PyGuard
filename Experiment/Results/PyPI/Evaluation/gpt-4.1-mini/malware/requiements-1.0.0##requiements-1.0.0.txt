      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install behavior when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted at runtime with a hardcoded key. This technique is commonly used to hide malicious code from static analysis. The executed payload could perform any arbitrary action, including downloading additional malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The obfuscation of the class name, package metadata, and the use of encrypted code strongly indicate an attempt to conceal malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious as it executes hidden, encrypted code during installation, which poses a security risk.",
