      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0). This behavior is characteristic of malware attempting to stealthily download and run a potentially harmful executable from the internet without user consent. The use of obfuscation (Base64 encoded PowerShell command), hidden window execution, and conditional execution based on the presence of a directory strongly indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code appears to be a decoy setup script for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload.",
