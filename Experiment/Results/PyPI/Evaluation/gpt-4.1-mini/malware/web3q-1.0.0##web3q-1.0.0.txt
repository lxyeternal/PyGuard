      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted at runtime with a hardcoded key. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malicious code because it hides the actual payload from static analysis and executes arbitrary code during installation without user consent. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution (exec) is a common technique to evade detection and deliver malware. The exact nature of the decrypted payload is not visible here, but the mechanism strongly indicates that the code is designed to run hidden malicious actions on Windows machines during package installation, potentially leading to unauthorized code execution, data theft, or system compromise.",
