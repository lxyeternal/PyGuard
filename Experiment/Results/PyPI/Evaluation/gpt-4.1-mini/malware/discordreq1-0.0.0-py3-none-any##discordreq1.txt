      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a malicious information stealer targeting Windows systems, specifically focusing on extracting sensitive data from browsers, Discord clients, and other applications. It performs the following malicious actions:\n\n1. **Token Stealing:** It searches for Discord tokens stored in local files and decrypts them if encrypted. It validates tokens by making API requests and collects user information such as username, email, phone number, badges, billing info, and friends list.\n\n2. **Password and Cookie Theft:** It accesses browser data directories (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge, Yandex, etc.) to extract saved passwords and cookies. It decrypts these using Windows DPAPI and AES-GCM with the browser's master key.\n\n3. **File and Folder Exfiltration:** It scans user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files and folders with keywords related to accounts, passwords, backups, wallets, tokens, etc. It uploads these files to anonymous file hosting services.\n\n4. **Zipping and Uploading Sensitive Data:** It compresses data folders related to wallets, gaming clients (Steam, Riot), Telegram, and others, then uploads these archives to anonymous file hosting services.\n\n5. **Data Exfiltration via Discord Webhook:** All stolen data (tokens, passwords, cookies, files, user info) is sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, allowing the attacker to receive the victim's sensitive information remotely.\n\n6. **Process Termination:** It forcibly terminates certain processes (e.g., browsers, Telegram) to access locked files.\n\n7. **Use of Obfuscation and Evasion:** The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, multiple threads for concurrent data collection, and retries for network requests to evade detection and ensure data exfiltration.\n\nOverall, this code is a fully featured credential and token stealer designed to compromise user accounts, financial information, and personal files, posing a severe privacy and security threat.",
