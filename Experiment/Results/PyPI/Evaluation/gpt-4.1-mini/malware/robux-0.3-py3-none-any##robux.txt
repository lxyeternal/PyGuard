      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily extract sensitive user information from the victim's computer and send it to a remote server. Specifically, it attempts to locate and decrypt Discord authentication tokens from various Discord and Chromium-based browser data folders by accessing encrypted local storage files. It also tries to extract Roblox '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies from multiple browsers using the 'browser_cookie3' library. The extracted Discord tokens and Roblox cookies are then sent via an HTTP POST request to a remote URL ('https://matched-anthem.000webhostapp.com/'), which is likely controlled by an attacker. This behavior constitutes credential theft and unauthorized data exfiltration, which can lead to account hijacking, privacy breaches, and further malicious exploitation of the victim's accounts. Additionally, the code attempts to install multiple Python packages silently if imports fail, which may be used to ensure the malicious functionality can run without interruption.",
