      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an invocation of a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to stealthily download and run a payload on the victim's machine without user consent or knowledge. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection. The rest of the code is a setup script that appears benign but is likely a decoy or a way to disguise the malicious payload execution within a seemingly normal package installation script.",
