      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from the URL 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmvy/Esquele.exe?dl=0'. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run a payload without user consent or knowledge. The use of a hidden window and encoded command is intended to evade detection. The rest of the code is a setup script that appears benign but is likely a cover or part of the malicious package. Overall, this code is malicious as it downloads and executes potentially harmful software from an external source covertly.",
