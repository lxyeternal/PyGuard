      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is malicious. It contains heavily obfuscated code that uses multiple layers of encoding and encryption, including base64, base32, zlib compression, marshal loading, and cryptography's Fernet symmetric encryption. The code dynamically decrypts and decompresses a large blob of data, then executes it using exec(). This technique is commonly used to hide the true payload and evade detection. The presence of cryptographic keys, encrypted data, and dynamic execution indicates that the code is designed to conceal malicious payloads or actions. Such behavior is typical of malware loaders or droppers that fetch and execute further malicious code, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise.",
