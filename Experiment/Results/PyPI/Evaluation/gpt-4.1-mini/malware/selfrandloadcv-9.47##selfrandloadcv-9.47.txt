      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and no console window created. The command is encoded in Base64 and decoded by PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter. This command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes a payload from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) as indicated by the commented URL and the encoded string. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and execute additional malicious code on the victim's machine without user consent or knowledge. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, this code is malicious as it attempts to run hidden remote commands that can compromise the system.",
