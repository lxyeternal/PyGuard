      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including base64, zlib compression, and character code transformations, to hide its true functionality. It dynamically constructs and executes code at runtime using eval and exec, which is a common technique in malicious scripts to evade detection and analysis. The code imports modules like 'codecs' and 'zlib' and uses randomization in decoding, further complicating static analysis. The presence of encoded payloads and dynamic execution strongly suggests that the code is designed to conceal malicious actions, such as executing hidden commands or downloading/executing additional malicious payloads. Without fully deobfuscating the entire payload, the behavior indicates an intent to hide potentially harmful operations, which is characteristic of malware or backdoor scripts.",
