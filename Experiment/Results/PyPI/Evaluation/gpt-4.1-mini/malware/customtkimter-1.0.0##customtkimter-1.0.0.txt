      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted with a hardcoded key. Executing decrypted code at install time is a common technique used to hide malicious actions. This behavior is suspicious and potentially harmful because it runs hidden code during installation without user knowledge or consent. The exact payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of encrypted execution strongly indicates an attempt to conceal malicious actions such as downloading further malware, executing arbitrary commands, or compromising the system. The obfuscated class name, meaningless description strings, and the requirement of 'fernet' and 'requests' packages further support the conclusion that this is malicious code designed to execute hidden payloads on Windows systems during package installation.",
