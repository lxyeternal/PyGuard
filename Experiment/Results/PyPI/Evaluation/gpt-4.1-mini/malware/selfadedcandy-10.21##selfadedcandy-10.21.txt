      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This command appears to invoke a web request to download or execute a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com with a query string referencing 'Esquele.exe'). The presence of a hidden PowerShell invocation, encoded command, and a remote URL strongly indicates that the code is designed to download and execute potentially malicious software on the victim's machine. This behavior is typical of malware loaders or droppers that try to stealthily fetch and run malicious binaries, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware infection. The rest of the code is a standard Python setup script, likely used as a decoy or to disguise the malicious payload.",
