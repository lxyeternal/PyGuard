      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is malicious. It uses multiple layers of obfuscation by encoding a Python script in base64 and then decoding and executing it dynamically. The decoded script imports modules to create a temporary file and writes to it the result of fetching and executing code from a remote URL (http://20.226.18.203/). Specifically, it performs HTTP requests to download executable code from two endpoints ('/grab/ry2K1CIVRSFa59vT' and '/clip'), reads the content, and executes it on the local system. This behavior is typical of a downloader or dropper malware that fetches and runs potentially harmful payloads from a remote server without user consent. The code also attempts to rename the temporary file with a '.exe' or '.w.exe' extension and execute it, which indicates an attempt to run Windows executables. This can lead to unauthorized code execution, system compromise, data theft, or further malware infection.",
