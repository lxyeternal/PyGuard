      "malicious_behavior": "This code performs malicious actions during the installation process of the Python package. Specifically, it sends a GET request to an external URL (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php) with the victim's computer name as a query parameter, potentially leaking sensitive environment information. Then, if the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable file from another suspicious URL (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and executes it using the system command 'start'. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently download and run potentially harmful software on the victim's machine without their consent, which can lead to system compromise, malware infection, or unauthorized remote control.",
