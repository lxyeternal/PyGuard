      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This command appears to invoke a web request to a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and downloads or executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. The presence of the hidden window style and encoded command indicates an attempt to conceal the execution of potentially harmful code. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and execute additional payloads or backdoors on the victim's machine without consent. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to facilitate installation, but the key malicious action is the hidden PowerShell execution that can compromise system security.",
