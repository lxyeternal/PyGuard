      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is malicious. It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate its true functionality, which is a common technique to hide malicious intent. The code decodes a large base64-encoded string and executes it using exec(), which can run arbitrary Python code. This obfuscation and dynamic execution pattern is typical of malware or backdoors designed to evade detection. The decoded payload likely contains further obfuscated or encoded instructions that could perform harmful actions such as unauthorized data access, system compromise, or remote code execution. Because the code hides its behavior behind multiple layers of string replacements and encoded execution, it is designed to evade static analysis and conceal its true purpose, which is a hallmark of malicious software.",
