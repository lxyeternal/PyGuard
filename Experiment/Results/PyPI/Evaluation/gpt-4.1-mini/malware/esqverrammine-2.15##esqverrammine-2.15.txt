      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor code that tries to download or execute additional payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the victim's machine. The presence of a check for a folder named 'tahg' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' suggests an attempt to avoid repeated execution or detection. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or a way to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installer, further indicating malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute potentially harmful commands on a Windows system, which constitutes malicious behavior.",
