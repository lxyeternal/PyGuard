      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains malicious behavior designed to exfiltrate sensitive information from the host machine to an external DNS server controlled by an attacker. Specifically, during the installation process (via the custom InstallScripts class overriding the install_scripts command), it collects the hostname, current working directory, public WAN IP address, and local IP addresses of the machine. It then encodes this information into a payload, converts it into a hex string, and sends it in chunks as DNS queries to a hardcoded subdomain under 'burpcollaborator.net' (a domain commonly used for security testing and DNS exfiltration). This technique is a form of DNS tunneling or data exfiltration via DNS requests, which can bypass many network security controls because DNS traffic is often allowed and less scrutinized. The code also prints the collected information and a SHA1 checksum of the payload, likely for debugging or confirmation. The presence of this covert data leak during installation, combined with the use of an external DNS server and a suspicious domain, clearly indicates malicious intent. The code masquerades as a harmless setup script but performs unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, which can compromise user privacy and security.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the hostname, current working directory, local IP addresses, and the public WAN IP address of the machine it runs on. It then encodes this information into a payload, converts it into a hexadecimal string, and exfiltrates it by sending DNS queries to a suspicious domain 'hte1ck6lvk1ktcuxl0x8jfgeu50vok.burpcollaborator.net'. This domain is associated with Burp Collaborator, a tool commonly used for detecting and exploiting vulnerabilities, indicating that the code is designed to leak sensitive environment data to an attacker-controlled DNS server. The use of DNS queries for data exfiltration is a known covert channel technique to bypass network monitoring. The code also contains commented-out or incomplete parts and a misleading print statement about reinstalling pip, possibly to disguise its true intent. Overall, this behavior is characteristic of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware.",
