      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that runs silently without user awareness. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor scripts that try to execute potentially harmful commands or download and run additional payloads without user consent. The use of a hidden window and encoded command is a common technique to evade detection and hide malicious activity. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate Python package setup call, likely used as a cover or to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of a PowerShell command that could compromise the system, making it malicious.",
