      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a malicious Discord token and credential stealer targeting Windows systems. It collects sensitive user data including Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords, billing information, IP address, and user environment details. It extracts Discord tokens from various browsers and Discord client local storage, decrypts Chrome-based browser passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI, and collects billing and friend information via Discord API using stolen tokens. The stolen data is then exfiltrated to a remote Discord webhook URL controlled by the attacker. Additionally, it searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files and folders with keywords related to accounts, passwords, wallets, crypto, and tokens, uploads these files to anonymous file hosting services, and sends links to the attacker. It also collects and uploads zipped data from wallets, gaming clients, and other apps. The code attempts to install required Python packages if missing, kills certain processes to access locked files, and uses multiple threads to speed up data collection. The overall purpose is to steal Discord credentials, browser data, and potentially other sensitive files for account takeover, financial theft, or further exploitation. This behavior is typical of malware known as a stealer.",
