      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to run payloads or connect to remote servers covertly. The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' and the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' suggests an attempt to avoid repeated execution and possibly connect to a malicious domain. The setup() call appears to be a decoy to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installer. Overall, this code is malicious as it executes hidden, encoded PowerShell commands that could compromise the system, download or execute further malware, or perform unauthorized actions.",
