      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This command appears to invoke a web request to download or execute a file from an external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and then runs it with hidden window style. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and execute a payload from the internet without user consent. The presence of the hidden window style and encoded command indicates an attempt to conceal the activity. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, but the malicious payload execution is triggered before that. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at silently downloading and executing potentially harmful software on the victim's machine.",
