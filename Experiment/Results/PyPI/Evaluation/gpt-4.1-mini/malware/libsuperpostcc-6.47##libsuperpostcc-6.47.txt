      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes a payload from an external URL (indicated by the commented URL www.esquelesquad.rip and the encoded command referencing a Dropbox URL). The use of hidden execution, encoded commands, and conditional execution to avoid repeated runs strongly suggests malicious intent. The setup() call appears to be a decoy to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installer, further indicating an attempt to hide malicious activity. The potential harm includes unauthorized code execution, downloading and running malware, or establishing persistence on the victim's machine.",
