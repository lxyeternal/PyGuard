      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard installation process of a Python package. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname of the machine, the current working directory, and the username of the user running the installation. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external server (jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com). This behavior is malicious because it exfiltrates potentially sensitive system information without user consent, which can be used for reconnaissance by attackers to further compromise the system or track users. The use of a suspicious external domain and the stealthy data transmission during package installation strongly indicate malicious intent.",
