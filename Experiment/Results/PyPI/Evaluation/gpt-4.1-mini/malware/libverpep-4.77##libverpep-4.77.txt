      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is indicative of malicious intent, as it tries to run a potentially harmful or unauthorized script in the background. The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' further suggests that this code is designed to download or execute malicious payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the system. The use of subprocess with hidden window style and encoded commands is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and run malicious code stealthily.",
