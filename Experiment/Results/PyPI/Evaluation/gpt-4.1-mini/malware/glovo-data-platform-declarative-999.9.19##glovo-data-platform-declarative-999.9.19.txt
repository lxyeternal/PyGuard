      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to stealthily collect and exfiltrate sensitive system information to a remote server. Specifically, it gathers the current Python call stack, environment variable keys, system information (via os.uname()), and the public IP address of the machine by querying an external service (ipinfo.io). This data is then encoded as JSON and sent via an HTTP POST request to a remote URL, which is base64-encoded in the source to obscure its destination. The code also includes checks to avoid running on certain known hostnames and filenames, likely to evade detection in analysis environments. Finally, it forcibly terminates the program with exit(1), which may disrupt normal operation. This behavior is characteristic of spyware or reconnaissance malware designed to gather information about the infected system without user consent.",
