      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that is base64-decoded and executed via exec(). The decoded payload creates a socket connection to the IP address 172.16.60.80 on port 9009 and attempts to receive and execute arbitrary code sent from that remote server. This behavior effectively creates a backdoor, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands or code on the victim's machine. Such functionality is highly malicious as it compromises system security, enables unauthorized remote control, and can lead to data theft, system damage, or further malware installation.",
