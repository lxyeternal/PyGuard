      "malicious_behavior": "This code performs malicious actions during the installation of the Python package. Specifically, it sends a GET request to an external server (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php) with the victim's computer name, potentially leaking sensitive environment information. Then, if the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable file ('python-install.scr' saved as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe') from another suspicious URL (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr) and executes it using the system command. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently download and run potentially harmful software on the victim's machine, which can lead to unauthorized code execution, system compromise, or malware infection.",
