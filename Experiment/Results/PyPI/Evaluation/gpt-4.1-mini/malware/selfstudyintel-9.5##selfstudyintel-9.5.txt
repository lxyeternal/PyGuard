      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com with a specific path). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run a payload silently on the victim's machine. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package. Overall, this code is malicious as it attempts to stealthily download and execute potentially harmful software from the internet.",
