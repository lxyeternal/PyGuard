      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a binary file from a hardcoded IP address (145.249.104.71) and saves it as a hidden file named '.drv' in the user's home directory. It then modifies the file permissions to make it executable. The script appends a command to the user's '.bashrc' file to automatically execute this downloaded binary in the background every time a new shell session starts, ensuring persistence. Additionally, it immediately runs the downloaded binary in a separate thread. This behavior is characteristic of malware aiming to install and persist a potentially harmful payload on the victim's system without consent. The use of a non-descriptive filename, direct IP address, and background execution strongly indicate malicious intent, potentially allowing remote control, data theft, or system compromise.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a remote server (http://145.249.104.71/out) and saves it as a hidden file named '.drv' in the user's home directory on Linux systems. It then changes the file's permissions to make it executable. After that, it appends a command to the user's .bashrc file to execute this downloaded file in the background every time a new shell session starts. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to persist on a system by executing a potentially harmful payload automatically on user login. The downloaded file could contain any malicious payload, such as a backdoor, keylogger, or other forms of malware. The code also suppresses execution on non-Linux systems by printing an error and exiting. Overall, this script is designed to stealthily install and maintain a malicious executable on a Linux system.",
