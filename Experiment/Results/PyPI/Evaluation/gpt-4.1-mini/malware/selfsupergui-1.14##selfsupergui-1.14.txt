      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is indicative of malicious intent, as it tries to run a hidden payload from an external URL (dl.dropbox.com) without user consent. The presence of a folder check ('tahg') before execution suggests it tries to avoid repeated execution. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, likely to disguise the malicious payload execution. This hidden execution can lead to unauthorized code running on the victim's machine, potentially downloading and executing further malware or compromising system security.",
