      "malicious_behavior": "This code performs malicious actions during the installation of the package. Specifically, it sends a GET request to an external server (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php) with the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' appended, potentially leaking the victim's computer name. Then, if the platform is Windows ('win32'), it downloads an executable file from https://python-release.com/python-install.scr, saves it locally as 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe', and executes it using the system command 'start'. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently download and run potentially harmful software on the victim's machine without their consent, which can lead to system compromise, malware infection, or unauthorized control.",
