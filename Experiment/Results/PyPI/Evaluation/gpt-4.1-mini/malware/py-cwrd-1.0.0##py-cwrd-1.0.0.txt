      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command (GruppeInstall) that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is decrypted and executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of obfuscated and potentially harmful behavior. This technique is commonly used to hide malicious payloads from static analysis. The exact decrypted payload is not visible in the source, but the use of encrypted code executed at install time strongly suggests the code is designed to perform unauthorized or harmful actions on the victim's machine, such as downloading additional malware, stealing data, or compromising system integrity. The obfuscation and conditional execution on Windows further indicate an attempt to evade detection and target specific environments. Therefore, this code is malicious.",
