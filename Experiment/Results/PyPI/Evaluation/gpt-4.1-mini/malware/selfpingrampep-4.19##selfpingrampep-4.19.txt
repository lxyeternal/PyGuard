      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and no console window created. The command is encoded in Base64 and decoded by PowerShell's -EncodedCommand parameter. This command invokes a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) into a hidden file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's system. The presence of the check for a folder named 'tahg' suggests it tries to avoid repeated execution. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and run a payload from the internet without user consent, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malicious activity. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, which appears benign but is likely a cover or delivery mechanism for the malicious payload.",
