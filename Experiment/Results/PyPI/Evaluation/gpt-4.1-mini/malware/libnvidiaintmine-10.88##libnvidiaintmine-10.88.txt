      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command appears to invoke a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) related to 'dl.dropbox.com' with a filename 'Esquele.exe'. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run a payload silently on the victim's machine. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection. The rest of the code is a setup script masquerading as a legitimate Python package, likely to disguise the malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious as it attempts to silently download and execute potentially harmful software on the host system.",
