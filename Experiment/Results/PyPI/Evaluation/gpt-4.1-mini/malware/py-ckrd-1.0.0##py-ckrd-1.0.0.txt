      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command (GruppeInstall) that executes during the package installation process on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the actual code being run until runtime, making static analysis difficult. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to conceal their true functionality. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution can be used to download additional malicious code, execute arbitrary commands, or compromise the system. The setup script masquerades as a normal Python package setup but embeds this hidden malicious payload execution triggered on installation, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or unauthorized remote control.",
