      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The script checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. The decoded command appears to invoke a web request to a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and run a payload from the internet without user consent, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malware infection. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, which seems to be a cover or distraction. Overall, the code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily downloading and executing a potentially harmful executable.",
