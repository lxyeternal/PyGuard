      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains obfuscated and encoded payloads that are executed conditionally depending on the operating system. It uses base64 decoding and exec to run hidden code. On Windows (nt), it decodes and executes a large base64-encoded string that appears to perform unauthorized file operations, including writing a binary payload to a file named 'MZ\\x90...' (typical of a Windows executable), and then starting that executable. On non-Windows systems, it similarly decodes and executes a base64-encoded payload that performs network requests, downloads data, and executes commands. The code is designed to evade detection by hiding its true intent in encoded strings and only executing the payload when not building a source distribution ('sdist'). This behavior is characteristic of malware or backdoor code that attempts to install and run unauthorized executables or scripts on the victim's machine, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malicious activity.",
