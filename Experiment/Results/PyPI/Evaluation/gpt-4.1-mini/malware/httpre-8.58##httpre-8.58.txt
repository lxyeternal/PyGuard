      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This command downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as '~\\WindowsCache.exe'. Running such a downloaded executable can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially compromising the system. The use of hidden window style and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and user awareness. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. Overall, this behavior is malicious as it downloads and runs an unknown executable from the internet without user consent.",
