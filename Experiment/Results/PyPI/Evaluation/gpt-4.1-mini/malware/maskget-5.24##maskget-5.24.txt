      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that runs without user visibility (hidden window). This command invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently download and run a payload from the internet, potentially compromising the system. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. The presence of hidden remote code execution and download of an executable from an external source classifies this code as malicious.",
