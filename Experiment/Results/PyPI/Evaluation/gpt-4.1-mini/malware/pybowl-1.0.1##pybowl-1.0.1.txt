      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior hidden inside the CustomInstallCommand class, which overrides the standard install command of setuptools. During installation, it decodes and executes a large base64-encoded payload. This payload performs the following harmful actions:\n\n1. It attempts to create and write multiple Windows Script Host (WSH) scripts and batch files into the user's roaming AppData directory under a path related to Microsoft Windows Start Menu Programs. These scripts appear to be designed to run silently and execute commands.\n\n2. It uses 'bitsadmin' to transfer and download a file named 'mydownloadjob' from a suspicious remote URL (https://api-hw.com/dl/w) to the local system, placing it in the same roaming AppData directory.\n\n3. It runs the downloaded executable and other scripts, likely to establish persistence or execute further payloads.\n\n4. It removes some of the created scripts after execution, attempting to cover its tracks.\n\nOverall, this code is a trojanized installer that, beyond installing a Python package, downloads and executes potentially harmful software from a remote server without user consent. This behavior can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware infection.",
