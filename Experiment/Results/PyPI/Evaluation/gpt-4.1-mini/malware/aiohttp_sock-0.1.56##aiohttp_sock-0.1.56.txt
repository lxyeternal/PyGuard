      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits clear malicious behavior. It first installs several Python packages via subprocess calls, which is unusual for a setup script and may be used to ensure dependencies for malicious payloads. Then, it creates a hidden directory inside the user's local temp folder named '__pycache__' and writes a heavily obfuscated Python script ('main.cpython-39.pyw') there. This script is base64-decoded from a large encoded string and contains multiple modules and classes that perform the following malicious actions:\n\n1. Persistence and Stealth: The script creates directories and files in user data and local storage paths, mimicking legitimate application data folders to hide its presence.\n\n2. Credential and Data Theft: It searches for and reads files related to browsers (Chrome, Opera GX, Yandex Browser), Telegram, Exodus wallet, and other software, extracting sensitive data such as passwords, cookies, and wallet information.\n\n3. Decryption and Extraction: The script includes cryptographic routines to decrypt stored passwords and cookies, indicating it targets encrypted credential stores.\n\n4. Data Exfiltration: The stolen data is packaged and sent via HTTP POST requests to a remote server (notably the hardcoded IP 'http://144.24.115.170'), which is a common behavior in information-stealing malware.\n\n5. Execution of Additional Payloads: The script writes and executes a VBScript file that launches the main Python script, indicating an attempt to run the payload stealthily.\n\n6. Use of Multiple Plugins: The code references plugins for browsers, wallets, and other applications, showing modular design to steal a wide range of data.\n\n7. Use of Base64 Encoding and Obfuscation: The main payload is base64-encoded and written to disk, a common technique to evade simple static detection.\n\nOverall, this code is a sophisticated information stealer designed to harvest credentials, cookies, wallet data, and other sensitive information from the victim's machine and exfiltrate it to a remote attacker-controlled server. It also attempts to maintain persistence and evade detection by hiding in typical application data folders and using encoded payloads.",
