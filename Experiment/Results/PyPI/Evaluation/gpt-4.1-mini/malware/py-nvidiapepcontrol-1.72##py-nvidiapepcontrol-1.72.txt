      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) with the filename 'Esquele.exe'. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run a payload from the internet without user consent or knowledge. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload execution. The presence of the hidden download and execution of an external executable indicates malicious intent, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malware infection.",
