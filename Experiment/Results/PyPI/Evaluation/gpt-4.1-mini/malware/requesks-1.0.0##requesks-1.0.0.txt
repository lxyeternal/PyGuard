      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command (GruppeInstall) that executes during the package installation process on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution hidden from static analysis. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to run hidden code during installation, potentially downloading further malicious components or performing unauthorized actions on the victim's machine. The obfuscation via encryption and the conditional execution only on Windows further suggest an attempt to evade detection and target specific environments. Therefore, this code is malicious and poses a security risk.",
