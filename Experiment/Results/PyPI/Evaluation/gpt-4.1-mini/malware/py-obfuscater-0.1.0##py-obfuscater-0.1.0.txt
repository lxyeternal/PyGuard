      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a malicious Discord token and credential stealer. It performs the following harmful actions:\n\n1. **Token Stealing:** It searches for Discord tokens stored in various browsers and Discord client local storage files by scanning specific directories and files. It validates these tokens by making API requests to Discord.\n\n2. **Credential Theft:** It extracts saved passwords and cookies from browsers by accessing and decrypting browser databases (SQLite files) using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption with the user's master key.\n\n3. **Data Exfiltration:** The stolen tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive information (such as billing info, phone numbers, badges, friends list) are formatted and sent to a remote attacker's Discord webhook URL (`https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1104290142912528457/...`). This allows the attacker to receive and misuse the victim's Discord credentials and personal data.\n\n4. **File Collection and Upload:** The code collects files from user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) that match certain keywords related to accounts, passwords, secrets, wallets, crypto, etc. It uploads these files to anonymous file hosting services (like gofile.io) and sends the links to the attacker.\n\n5. **Process Interference:** It attempts to kill certain processes (e.g., browsers, Telegram) to access locked files.\n\n6. **Persistence and Evasion:** It installs required Python packages if missing, uses threading for concurrent data collection, and suppresses exceptions to avoid crashing.\n\n7. **Obfuscation and Misleading Comments:** The code includes misleading comments and variable names to disguise its true purpose.\n\nOverall, this code is designed to stealthily harvest sensitive user data, especially Discord tokens and browser credentials, and send them to an attacker-controlled server, enabling account hijacking, identity theft, and financial fraud.",
