      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains obfuscated and encoded payloads that are decoded and executed at runtime. It uses base64 decoding and exec calls to run hidden code, which is a common technique used in malicious scripts to evade detection. The code checks the operating system and executes different base64-decoded payloads accordingly. The payloads appear to perform actions such as reading and writing files, manipulating processes, and possibly establishing unauthorized access or control. The presence of encoded strings, dynamic execution, and system-level operations strongly indicate malicious intent, such as backdoor installation, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
