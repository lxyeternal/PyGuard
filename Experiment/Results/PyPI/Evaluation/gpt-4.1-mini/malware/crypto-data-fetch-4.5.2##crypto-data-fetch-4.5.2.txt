      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by performing unauthorized network communication and downloading and executing an external executable file on Windows systems during the package installation process. Specifically, it sends a GET request to a remote server (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php) with the local computer's name as a parameter, potentially leaking sensitive environment information. Then, if the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable file from https://python-release.com/python-install.scr, saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and executes it using the system command 'start'. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently install additional malicious payloads on the victim's machine without user consent, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further infection.",
