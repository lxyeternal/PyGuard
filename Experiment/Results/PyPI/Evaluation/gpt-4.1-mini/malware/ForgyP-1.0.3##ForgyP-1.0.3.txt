      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is malicious. It contains heavily obfuscated code that uses multiple layers of encoding and encryption, including base64, base32, zlib compression, marshal loading, and cryptography's Fernet symmetric encryption. The code dynamically decrypts and decompresses a large blob of data, then executes it using exec(). This technique is commonly used to hide the true payload and evade detection. The obfuscated payload is likely to perform unauthorized or harmful actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or system compromise. The presence of cryptographic keys, encoded data, and dynamic execution strongly indicates that the code is designed to conceal malicious behavior and execute hidden malicious payloads.",
