      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the source code and executed via exec(). This behavior is characteristic of malicious code attempting to hide its true functionality by encrypting the payload and only decrypting it at runtime. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The code does not reveal what the decrypted payload does, but the pattern strongly suggests it is designed to run hidden or harmful operations during installation, potentially compromising the system. Therefore, this code is malicious.",
