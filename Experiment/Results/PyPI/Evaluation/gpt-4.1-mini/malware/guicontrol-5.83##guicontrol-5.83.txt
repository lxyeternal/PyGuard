      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is suspicious and typical of malware or backdoor activity, as it tries to run a hidden script from a remote URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and save it as a file named '~\\WindowsCache.exe'. The script first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden command, likely to download and execute a malicious executable. This can lead to unauthorized code execution, persistence, and potential compromise of the system. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script.",
