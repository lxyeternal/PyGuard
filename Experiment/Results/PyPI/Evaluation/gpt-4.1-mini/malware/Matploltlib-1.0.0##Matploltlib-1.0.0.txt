      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a piece of encrypted Python code using a Fernet symmetric encryption key. This decrypted code is executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the actual payload from static analysis. The use of encrypted payload executed at install time is a common technique to evade detection and deliver malicious functionality. The exact behavior of the decrypted payload is not visible in the source, but the presence of network-related modules (requests) and encrypted execution strongly suggests it could perform unauthorized actions such as downloading further malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. Additionally, the package name 'Matploltlib' is a misspelling of the legitimate 'matplotlib' package, which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. Overall, this code is malicious and designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful code on Windows machines during installation.",
