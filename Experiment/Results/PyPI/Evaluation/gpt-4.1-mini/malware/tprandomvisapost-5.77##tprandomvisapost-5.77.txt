      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com with a path referencing 'Esquele'). This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and run a payload from the internet without user consent, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malicious activity. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to facilitate installation. Overall, the code contains clear malicious behavior aimed at stealthily downloading and executing a remote executable.",
