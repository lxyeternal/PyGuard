      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typically used to download or execute additional payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the system. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or detection. The use of a hidden window and encoded commands strongly indicates an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears benign but is likely a cover or part of the malware distribution. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily executing potentially harmful PowerShell commands on a Windows system.",
