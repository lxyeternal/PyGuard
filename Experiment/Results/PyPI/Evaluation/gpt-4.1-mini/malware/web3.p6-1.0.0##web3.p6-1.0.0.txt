      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using a Fernet symmetric encryption key. The encrypted payload is embedded as a byte string and decrypted at runtime, then executed with exec(). This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malicious code because it hides the actual payload from static analysis by encrypting it and only decrypting it during installation. The use of exec() on decrypted data can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing the attacker to run any code on the victim's machine, such as downloading malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The obfuscated class name, meaningless metadata strings, and the encrypted payload strongly indicate an attempt to conceal malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious.",
