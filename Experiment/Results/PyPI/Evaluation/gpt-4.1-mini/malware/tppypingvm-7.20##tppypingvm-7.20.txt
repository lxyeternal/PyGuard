      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes a payload from a remote URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) as indicated by the comment and the encoded command string. Running such hidden, encoded commands without user consent is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute potentially harmful actions such as downloading and running malicious software, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The rest of the code is a seemingly benign setup script, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. Overall, this behavior is malicious and poses a security risk.",
