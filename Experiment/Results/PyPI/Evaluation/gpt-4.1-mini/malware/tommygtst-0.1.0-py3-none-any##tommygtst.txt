      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a fully featured malicious stealer malware targeting Windows systems. It performs multiple harmful actions including:\n\n1. **Credential Theft:** It steals saved passwords, cookies, credit card information, and browsing history from multiple browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge, Yandex, etc.) by accessing browser data files, decrypting encrypted credentials using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption with extracted master keys.\n\n2. **Discord Token Stealing:** It searches for Discord tokens stored in various Discord and browser local storage locations, validates them by querying Discord API, and collects user information.\n\n3. **System Information Gathering:** It collects detailed system information such as Windows product key, version, hardware UUID, RAM, disk size, IP address, geolocation, and more.\n\n4. **Clipboard Hijacking for Cryptocurrency Addresses:** It monitors the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet addresses and replaces them with attacker-controlled addresses to hijack crypto transactions.\n\n5. **Screenshot Capture:** It takes screenshots of the victim's desktop.\n\n6. **Roblox Cookie Theft:** It extracts Roblox cookies from registry keys.\n\n7. **Persistence:** It attempts to copy itself to the Windows startup folder to run on system boot.\n\n8. **Anti-Debugging and VM Detection:** It includes checks to detect virtual machines, debuggers, and analysis environments and exits if detected.\n\n9. **Exfiltration:** All stolen data (credentials, tokens, system info, screenshots, zipped files) is uploaded to attacker-controlled Discord webhooks and external file hosting services.\n\n10. **Process Killing:** It can kill Discord-related processes to avoid detection or interference.\n\nOverall, this code is designed to silently steal sensitive user data, including credentials and tokens, and send it to an attacker-controlled server, enabling account takeover, financial theft, and privacy invasion. It is highly malicious and should be treated as malware.",
