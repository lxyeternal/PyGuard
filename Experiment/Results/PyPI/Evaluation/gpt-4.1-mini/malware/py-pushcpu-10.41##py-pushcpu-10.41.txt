      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This command appears to invoke a web request to download or execute a file from an external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and then runs it with hidden window style. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and execute a payload from the internet covertly. The presence of the hidden PowerShell execution, the encoded command, and the external download URL strongly indicate malicious intent, likely to compromise the system by running unauthorized code. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which seems to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload execution.",
