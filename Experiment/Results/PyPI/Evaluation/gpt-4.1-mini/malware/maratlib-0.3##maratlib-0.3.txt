      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a direct call to execute a shell command via os.system that downloads and runs a shell script from a remote URL (https://github.com/nedog123/files/raw/main/aza-ob.sh). Specifically, it uses wget to fetch the script to /tmp/gay.sh, changes its permissions to be executable, and then executes it with bash. This behavior is malicious because it downloads and runs potentially harmful code from an untrusted external source without user consent or verification. Such actions can lead to unauthorized system compromise, data theft, installation of malware, or other harmful effects. The rest of the code appears to be obfuscated and includes a function that decodes some strings and uses eval, which could be used to hide further malicious payloads or behavior. Overall, the presence of remote code download and execution makes this code malicious.",
