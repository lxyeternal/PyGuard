      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to run unauthorized commands or download and execute payloads. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear benign. The presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially to download or execute further malicious payloads from the referenced URL (www.esquelesquad.rip). This can lead to system compromise, data theft, or unauthorized remote control.",
