      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is suspicious and typical of malware or backdoor installation attempts. The script first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs the encoded PowerShell command. The encoded command likely downloads or executes additional payloads from a remote source (the decoded command references a URL 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm...'), which can lead to unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of potentially harmful remote code, making it malicious.",
