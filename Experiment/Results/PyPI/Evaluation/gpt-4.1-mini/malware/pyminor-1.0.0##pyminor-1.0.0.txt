      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload embedded as a string variable (wopvEaTEcopFEavc) which is XOR-decoded using a numeric key string (iOpvEoeaaeavocp). The decoded payload is then executed dynamically via eval(compile(...)). This technique is commonly used to hide malicious code from static analysis. The obfuscated code is executed during the installation phase of the package (in the overridden InstallCommand.run method), which means it runs automatically when the package is installed. The exact behavior of the decoded payload is not directly visible, but the use of obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly indicates malicious intent, such as executing unauthorized code, installing backdoors, or performing other harmful actions without user consent. The try-except block suppresses any errors, further indicating an attempt to hide failures and avoid detection. Overall, this is a classic example of a malicious Python package installer that executes hidden code during installation.",
