      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a malicious credential and data stealer targeting Windows systems. It collects sensitive user information from various installed browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge) and Discord clients by extracting stored tokens, passwords, cookies, and other data. It decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption with the user's master key. The code also collects Discord user information, including tokens, billing info, badges, friends, email, phone, and Nitro status. It searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files and folders with keywords related to accounts, passwords, backups, and crypto wallets, uploading these files to anonymous file hosting services. The stolen data is exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to a remote webhook URL (likely a Discord webhook) fetched from a Pastebin raw URL. The code also attempts to kill certain processes (e.g., browsers, Telegram) to access locked files. Overall, this script is designed to stealthily harvest and exfiltrate a victim's sensitive credentials, tokens, cookies, and files, enabling account takeover, identity theft, financial fraud, and privacy invasion.",
