      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class for a Python package that executes hidden, encrypted code during installation, but only on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). Specifically, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts a base64-encoded payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and executes it with exec(). This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malware or backdoor installation routines, as it runs concealed code fetched from or related to external sources without user consent or visibility. The encrypted payload could perform any malicious action such as downloading further malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The obfuscation via encryption and the conditional execution only on Windows further indicate an attempt to evade detection and limit execution to targeted environments. Therefore, this code is malicious.",
