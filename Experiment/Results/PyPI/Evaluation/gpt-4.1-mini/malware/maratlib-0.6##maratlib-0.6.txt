      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads and executes a shell script from a remote URL (https://github.com/nedog123/files/raw/main/aza.sh) twice by using subprocess.getoutput to run shell commands that change directory to /tmp, download the script as 'gay.sh', make it executable, and then execute it. This behavior is malicious because it executes arbitrary code fetched from the internet without user consent or verification, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or other harmful actions. The obfuscated function l111_cringe_ decodes some strings but is not directly harmful; the main malicious action is the silent download and execution of the remote script. The use of misleading variable names and repeated execution of the script further indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent.",
