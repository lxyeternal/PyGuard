      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the actual code being run until runtime, making static analysis difficult. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to conceal their true functionality. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution can be used to download additional malicious code, steal information, or compromise the system. The obfuscated class name, meaningless package metadata, and the encrypted payload strongly suggest this is malicious code designed to run hidden malicious actions during package installation on Windows systems.",
