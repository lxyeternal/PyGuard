      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is malicious. It defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process. During installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is decrypted with a hardcoded key and executed via exec(). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to hide its true payload and execute arbitrary code during package installation. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution suggests an attempt to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions on the victim's machine. The exact payload is not visible in the source, but the mechanism strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially including downloading further malware, stealing data, or compromising the system.",
