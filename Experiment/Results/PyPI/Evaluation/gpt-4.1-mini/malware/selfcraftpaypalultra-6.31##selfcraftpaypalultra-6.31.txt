      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com with a specific path). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run a payload silently on the victim's machine. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload execution. The presence of hidden execution, encoded commands, and downloading/executing external binaries without user consent confirms the code is malicious and potentially harmful, as it can lead to unauthorized code execution, system compromise, or further malware infection.",
