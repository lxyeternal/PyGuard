      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that invokes a web request to 'https://github.com/T4hg/ee/raw/master/Stage1.exe' and outputs the result to a file named 'WindowsCache.exe'. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to silently download and execute a payload from a remote server without user consent. The use of a hidden window and encoded command is intended to evade detection and user awareness. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup script, possibly to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly normal package. Overall, this code is malicious as it downloads and potentially executes an external executable from an untrusted source, which can compromise the system's security.",
