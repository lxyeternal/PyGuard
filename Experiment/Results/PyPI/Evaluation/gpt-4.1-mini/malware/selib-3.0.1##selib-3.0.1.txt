      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated and encoded payload executed at runtime via the use of __import__('builtins').exec and base64 decoding. The decoded payload imports modules to create a temporary file, writes Python code into it that imports urllib.request to open a remote URL (https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/hzzzp/raw), reads and executes the content fetched from this URL, then deletes the temporary file. This behavior effectively downloads and executes remote code without user consent, which is a classic characteristic of malicious code. The remote code execution can lead to arbitrary code running on the victim's machine, potentially causing data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation. The rest of the code (the setup() call) appears benign and is likely a disguise to make the script look like a normal Python package setup script.",
