      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. The script checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. The decoded command appears to invoke a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) related to 'dl.dropbox.com' with a query string, saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then executing it. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to download and run a payload from the internet without user consent, potentially compromising the system. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily downloading and executing a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine.",
