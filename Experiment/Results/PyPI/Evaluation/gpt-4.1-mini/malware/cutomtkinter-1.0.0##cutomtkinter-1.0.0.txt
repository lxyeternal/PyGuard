      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior embedded in the custom install command class XTqboYzRjvpORQdaoYHOZuoFOrEiHnQPiQcFPvSoVMWRBHEHKPRxeqxNzHuHTiJyvMpCOZgUDGDFwFxKmrhZeQAK, which overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is decrypted with a hardcoded key and executed via exec(). This technique hides the actual malicious payload from static analysis and only runs on Windows systems during package installation. The decrypted code is not visible in the source, but the use of exec on decrypted data strongly indicates execution of hidden malicious code. Such behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to run unauthorized code on the victim's machine during package installation, potentially leading to compromise, data theft, or system damage.",
