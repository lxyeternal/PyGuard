      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior hidden inside a custom install command class that overrides the standard setuptools install process. Specifically, during installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), which can run arbitrary Python code. This technique is commonly used to hide malicious code from static analysis and casual inspection. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution suggests the code is designed to perform unauthorized or harmful actions on the victim's machine during package installation. The exact nature of the payload is not visible in the source, but the behavior of decrypting and executing hidden code at install time is a strong indicator of malicious intent, potentially including downloading further malware, stealing data, or compromising the system.",
