      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to download or execute additional payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the system. The presence of a check for a folder named 'tahg' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' suggests an attempt to evade repeated execution or detection. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW and hidden window style further indicates an attempt to conceal the execution from the user. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily running potentially harmful PowerShell commands on the victim's machine.",
