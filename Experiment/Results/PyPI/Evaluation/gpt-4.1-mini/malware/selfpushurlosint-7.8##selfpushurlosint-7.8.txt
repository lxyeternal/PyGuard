      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This PowerShell command invokes a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) under the guise of a seemingly legitimate setup script. The presence of the hidden execution, encoded command, and external download from an untrusted source strongly indicates malicious intent. The code tries to avoid detection by running the PowerShell command silently and only if a certain directory ('tahg') does not exist. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and execute payloads without user consent, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation.",
