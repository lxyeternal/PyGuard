      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command passed as a base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an invocation of a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a remote URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to stealthily download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent or knowledge. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly downloading and executing a remote payload, which can compromise system security.",
