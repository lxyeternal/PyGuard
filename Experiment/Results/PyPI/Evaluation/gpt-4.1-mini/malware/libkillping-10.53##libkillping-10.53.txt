      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run a payload without user consent or visibility. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. The presence of hidden remote code execution and downloading an executable from an untrusted source constitutes malicious behavior, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malware infection.",
