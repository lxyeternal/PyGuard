      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install behavior when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a piece of encrypted Python code using a hardcoded Fernet key. This decrypted code is executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the actual payload from static analysis. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution suggests the code is designed to conceal its true behavior, which could include downloading additional malicious components, executing harmful commands, or compromising the system. The obfuscation of class names and meaningless metadata further supports the suspicion of malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious as it attempts to execute hidden, encrypted code during installation, potentially harming the user's system or compromising security.",
