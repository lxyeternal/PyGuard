      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently (no window shown) and is designed to invoke a web request to a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and download or execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and execute additional payloads without user consent. The presence of the hidden directory check ('tahg') and the use of encoded PowerShell commands to evade detection further indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup script that appears benign but is likely a disguise or part of a trojanized package. Overall, this code is malicious as it attempts to stealthily download and execute potentially harmful software on the victim's machine.",
