      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class 'new_install' that registers a function '_post_install' to be executed at program exit (via atexit). The '_post_install' function performs several suspicious actions: it creates/appends a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with the text 'proof bug by kotko' on the user's system, then collects sensitive environment information including the public IP address (queried from https://api.ipify.org), the hostname of the machine (via os.uname()), and the absolute path of the current script directory. It encodes this information in base64 and sends it as a GET request parameter to an external URL 'https://kotko.org' with query parameters constructed from the company and package name. This behavior effectively leaks potentially sensitive user environment data to a remote server without user consent. Such data exfiltration during package installation is a common malicious pattern used for reconnaissance or tracking. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior.",
