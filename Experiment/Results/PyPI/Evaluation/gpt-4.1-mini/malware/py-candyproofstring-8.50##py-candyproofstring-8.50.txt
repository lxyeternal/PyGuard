      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is indicative of malware or a backdoor attempting to run potentially harmful or unauthorized commands on the victim's machine. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which suggests an attempt to avoid repeated execution or detection. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, likely to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute hidden commands on a Windows system, which is a common trait of malicious software.",
