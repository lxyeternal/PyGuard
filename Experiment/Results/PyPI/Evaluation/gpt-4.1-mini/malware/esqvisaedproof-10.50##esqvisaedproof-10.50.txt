      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This PowerShell command invokes a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) without user consent or knowledge. The presence of the hidden execution and the external download from an untrusted source strongly indicates malicious intent, such as downloading and running malware or a backdoor. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, likely to evade suspicion.",
