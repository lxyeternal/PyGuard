      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The script is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution or detection. The PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and downloads or executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and run a payload from a remote server covertly, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a setup script that appears legitimate but is likely a decoy or a way to disguise the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily downloading and executing a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine.",
