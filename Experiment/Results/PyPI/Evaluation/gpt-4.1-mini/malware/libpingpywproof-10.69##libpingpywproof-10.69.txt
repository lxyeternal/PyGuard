      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The presence of the hidden window style and encoded command strongly indicates an attempt to run potentially harmful or unauthorized actions on the system. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the use of a non-standard directory name 'tahg' suggest an attempt to evade detection or persist on the system. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor installation scripts that try to download or execute further payloads from a remote source (the encoded command likely contains a URL or script to be executed). The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Overall, the code is malicious as it tries to stealthily execute a hidden PowerShell command that could compromise the system.",
