      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that runs without a visible window, which is a common technique used to hide malicious activity. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution or detection. The exact decoded command appears to invoke a web request to download or execute a file from an external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe), saving it as '~\\WindowsCache.exe' and then executing it. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and runs a payload from the internet without user consent, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within seemingly benign code.",
