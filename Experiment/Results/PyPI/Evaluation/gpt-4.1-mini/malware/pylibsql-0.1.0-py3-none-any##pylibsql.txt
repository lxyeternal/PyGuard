      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a sophisticated malicious software (malware) designed to steal sensitive user data from a Windows PC. It performs multiple harmful actions including:\n\n1. **Credential Theft:** It extracts saved passwords, cookies, credit card information, and browsing history from various browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge, Yandex, etc.) by accessing browser data files, decrypting encrypted credentials using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption with extracted master keys.\n\n2. **Discord Token Stealing:** It searches for Discord tokens stored in local storage of Discord and other Chromium-based apps, validates them by querying Discord API, and collects user information associated with these tokens.\n\n3. **Clipboard Hijacking for Cryptocurrency Addresses:** It monitors the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet addresses and replaces them with attacker-controlled addresses to redirect cryptocurrency transactions to the attacker.\n\n4. **System Information Gathering:** It collects detailed system information including Windows product key, version, hardware UUID, IP address, geolocation, RAM, disk size, and running processes.\n\n5. **Screenshot Capture:** It takes screenshots of the victim's desktop.\n\n6. **Roblox Cookie Theft:** It attempts to extract Roblox security cookies from the Windows registry.\n\n7. **Persistence Mechanism:** It copies itself to the Windows startup folder to run on system boot.\n\n8. **Anti-Debugging and Anti-VM Checks:** It attempts to detect if it is running in a virtual machine or debugging environment and exits if detected.\n\n9. **Data Exfiltration:** It compresses stolen data into zip files and uploads them to a remote server via HTTP POST requests to a Discord webhook URL controlled by the attacker (https://realbatman.com/ and other URLs). It also uploads files to anonymous file sharing services.\n\n10. **Process Killing:** Optionally kills Discord-related processes to avoid detection or interference.\n\n11. **Fake Error Message:** Optionally displays a fake error message to the user to mask its activity.\n\nOverall, this code is a fully featured information stealer and clipboard hijacker malware targeting Windows users, designed to steal credentials, tokens, cryptocurrency, and other sensitive data, then exfiltrate it to attacker-controlled servers. Its presence on a system poses a severe security and privacy risk.",
