      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains obfuscated and encoded payload executed during the installation process of the package. Specifically, the custom InstallCommand class overrides the run() method of setuptools' install command. Inside this method, a large obfuscated string (wopvEaTEcopFEavc) is XOR-decoded using a numeric key string (iOpvEoeaaeavocp). The decoded string is then executed dynamically using eval(compile(...)). This technique is a common method to hide malicious code from casual inspection. Because the decoded payload is not directly visible, it is highly suspicious and typical of malware or backdoor installation routines. The code attempts to execute arbitrary code during package installation, which can lead to unauthorized actions such as data theft, system compromise, or persistence mechanisms. The use of try-except to silently ignore errors further suggests an attempt to evade detection or prevent installation failure from revealing the malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious as it executes hidden, obfuscated code during installation, posing a security risk.",
