      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is malicious. It masquerades as a setup script for a Python package but contains hidden functionality that downloads, decrypts, and exfiltrates sensitive user data. Specifically, it creates a hidden directory in the user's local temp folder named '__pycache__' and writes a base64-decoded Python script ('main.cpython-39.py') into it. This script, when executed silently in the background, performs extensive reconnaissance on the infected system, including:\n\n- Searching for user data folders such as 'appdata', 'local', 'programs', 'roaming', 'documents', 'downloads', and 'desktop'.\n- Collecting credentials and cookies from multiple browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera GX Stable, Yandex Browser, Brave, and others) by scanning browser data directories.\n- Decrypting stored passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption with keys extracted from local state files.\n- Extracting Telegram session data and tokens.\n- Collecting files from specific folders like 'backups', 'wallets', and 'passwords', including sensitive files like 'passphrase.json'.\n- Taking screenshots using the MSS library.\n- Uploading all collected data to a remote server via HTTP POST requests.\n- Running stealthily using pythonw.exe with process creation flags to hide the console window.\n\nThe code also installs several Python packages (psutil, aiofiles, aiohttp, cryptography, aiosqlite, mss, pypiwin32) which are likely dependencies for the malicious payload.\n\nOverall, this code acts as a sophisticated information stealer and spyware, designed to harvest sensitive credentials, browser data, Telegram sessions, and other personal information from the victim's machine and send it to an attacker-controlled server. This poses a severe privacy and security risk to any user running this code.",
