      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module named 'httpsrequestsfast', which is not a standard or widely recognized Python library. The suspicious module name suggests it might be designed to perform HTTP(S) requests quickly, potentially to exfiltrate data or communicate with a command and control server. Since the module is not standard and the code attempts to import it without any further context, it could be a disguised or malicious package intended to facilitate unauthorized network communication or data theft. Without the actual module code, the import itself is suspicious and indicative of potential malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to stealthily extract Discord user tokens from various local storage paths associated with Discord clients and multiple browsers. It searches through LevelDB files for token patterns, validates these tokens by making authorized requests to Discord's API, and collects sensitive user information such as email, phone number, and billing/payment method status linked to these tokens. The collected data, along with the victim's IP address, is then encoded and sent to a remote Discord webhook URL controlled by the attacker. This behavior constitutes token theft and exfiltration of personal and financial information, enabling unauthorized access to victims' Discord accounts and potential misuse of their payment methods. Such actions are malicious and violate user privacy and security.",
