      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or runs a payload from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and saves it as a file named 'x/WindowsCache.exe' (based on the decoded command). The use of hidden execution, encoded commands, and conditional execution to avoid detection are typical indicators of malicious behavior. The setup() call appears to be a decoy to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installer. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute potentially harmful code on the victim's machine, which can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or further malware installation.",
