      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor scripts that try to execute potentially harmful or unauthorized commands on the victim's machine. The use of 'WindowStyle Hidden' and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and hide malicious activity. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to appear benign. The presence of this hidden PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as it can be used to download, execute, or control malware payloads remotely.",
