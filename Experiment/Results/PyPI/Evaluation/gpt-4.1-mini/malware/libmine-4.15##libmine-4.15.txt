      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor scripts that try to run potentially harmful commands or download and execute payloads without user consent. The presence of the hidden PowerShell execution and the use of encoded commands to obscure the actual payload strongly indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup script, likely used as a disguise or to blend in, but the hidden PowerShell execution is a clear sign of malicious behavior.",
