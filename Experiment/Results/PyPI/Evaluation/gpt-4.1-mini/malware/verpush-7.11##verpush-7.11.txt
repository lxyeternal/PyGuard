      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the system covertly. The script first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs the hidden PowerShell command. The use of hidden window style and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and hide malicious activity. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at executing hidden PowerShell commands that could compromise the system.",
