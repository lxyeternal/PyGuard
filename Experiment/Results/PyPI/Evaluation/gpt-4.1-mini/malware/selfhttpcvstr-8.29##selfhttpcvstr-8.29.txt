      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that try to download or execute additional payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the system. The presence of a check for a folder named 'tahg' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' (which appears suspicious) further suggests malicious intent. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installer, but the primary malicious action is the hidden PowerShell execution. This can lead to unauthorized code execution, potential system compromise, data theft, or installation of further malware.",
