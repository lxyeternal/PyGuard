      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a remote URL (dl.dropbox.com). This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to appear benign. Overall, the code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly downloading and executing a remote payload, which can compromise system security.",
