      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This command appears to invoke a web request to a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and downloads or executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. The presence of the hidden window style, encoded command, and external URL strongly indicates that the code is designed to stealthily download and execute potentially harmful software, which is a common behavior in malware for persistence, data theft, or further compromise. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly executing unauthorized code on the victim's machine.",
