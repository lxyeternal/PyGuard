      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior. It creates a hidden directory named 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK' which mimics a Windows system folder to avoid suspicion. It then downloads two executable files from external URLs hosted on Discord's CDN, saves them into this hidden directory with obfuscated filenames, and executes them using os.startfile. The downloaded executables could be any form of malware (e.g., trojans, ransomware, spyware) and running them without user consent poses a significant security risk. After launching the executables, the script attempts to delete the hidden directory, likely to cover its tracks. The use of misleading package metadata (e.g., keywords='hack', a benign description) and attempts to install packages dynamically further indicate attempts to evade detection. Overall, this script is designed to silently download and execute potentially harmful binaries on the victim's machine.",
