      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the system covertly. The script first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs the hidden PowerShell command. The exact decoded command is obfuscated, but the use of hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands strongly indicates malicious intent, such as downloading or executing further malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or compromising the system. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script.",
