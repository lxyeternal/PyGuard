      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from the URL 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0'. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently download and run a potentially harmful executable from the internet without user consent. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at downloading and executing unauthorized software, which can compromise system security.",
