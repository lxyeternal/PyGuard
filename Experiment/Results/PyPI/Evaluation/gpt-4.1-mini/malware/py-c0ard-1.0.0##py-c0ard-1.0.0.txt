      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command (GruppeInstall) that executes during the package installation process. Specifically, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malicious code because it hides the actual payload from static analysis by encrypting it and only decrypts and executes it at runtime during installation. The executed payload could perform any arbitrary and potentially harmful actions on the victim's system, such as downloading malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The use of encrypted code execution during installation is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and analysis. Therefore, this code is malicious.",
