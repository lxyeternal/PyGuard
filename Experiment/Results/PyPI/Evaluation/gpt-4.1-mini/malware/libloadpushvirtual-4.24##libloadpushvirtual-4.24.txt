      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or connect to remote servers covertly. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the use of a suspicious folder name 'tahg' suggest an attempt to evade detection by only running once if the folder does not exist. The setup() call appears to be a decoy to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installer. Overall, this code is malicious as it tries to run hidden PowerShell commands that could download or execute further malicious payloads, potentially compromising the system.",
