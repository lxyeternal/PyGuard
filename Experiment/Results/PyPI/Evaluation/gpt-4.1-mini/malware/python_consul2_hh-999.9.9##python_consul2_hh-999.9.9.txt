      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a Python package setup script that hooks into the installation, development, and egg_info commands to execute a custom function (custom_command) during these phases. This function collects sensitive information from the victim's machine, including the package name, the hostname, the current user name, and the current working directory. It then serializes this data into JSON, encodes it as a hex string, splits it into chunks, and exfiltrates it covertly by sending DNS queries to a remote nameserver (ns1.for-research.ru). The DNS queries are crafted with the encoded data embedded in subdomain labels, effectively using DNS tunneling to leak information without raising immediate suspicion. This behavior is malicious because it collects and transmits potentially sensitive system information to an external server without user consent, which can be used for reconnaissance or further attacks.",
