      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor scripts that try to execute potentially harmful commands or download and run additional payloads without user consent. The script also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of potentially harmful PowerShell commands, which is a clear indicator of malicious behavior.",
