      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. The script is triggered only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution or detection. The PowerShell command appears to invoke a web request to download or execute a remote payload from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) related to 'dl.dropbox.com' and 'Esquele.exe'. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run additional malicious software on the victim's machine. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection by users and security software. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily downloading and executing potentially harmful software.",
