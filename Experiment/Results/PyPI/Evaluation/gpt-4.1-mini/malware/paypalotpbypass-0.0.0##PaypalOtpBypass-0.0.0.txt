      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including base64 decoding, string decoding, and dynamic evaluation via eval. It imports modules dynamically and constructs function names and calls in an obfuscated manner. The code ultimately decodes and executes a large base64-encoded payload, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true functionality and evade detection. Such behavior is indicative of malicious intent, as it attempts to conceal the actual code being run and likely performs unauthorized or harmful actions once executed. The obfuscation and dynamic execution pattern strongly suggest that this code is designed to execute hidden malicious payloads, potentially compromising the system, stealing data, or performing other harmful activities.",
