      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or connect to remote servers covertly. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the use of a hidden PowerShell window further indicate an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The setup() call appears to be a decoy to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installer, but the primary malicious action is the hidden execution of the encoded PowerShell command, which could download, execute, or control malware on the victim's machine.",
