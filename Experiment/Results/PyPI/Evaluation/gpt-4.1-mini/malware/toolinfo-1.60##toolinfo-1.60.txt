      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or connect to remote servers covertly. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs the hidden PowerShell command. The exact decoded command appears to invoke a web request to a remote URL (likely to download or execute further malicious payloads) and then runs a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden window. This indicates the code is designed to stealthily download and execute potentially harmful software on the victim's machine, which is a clear malicious behavior.",
