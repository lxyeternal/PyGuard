      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. The script is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution or detection. The PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and downloads or executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and run additional payloads or backdoors on the victim's machine without consent. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of potentially harmful external code, making it malicious.",
