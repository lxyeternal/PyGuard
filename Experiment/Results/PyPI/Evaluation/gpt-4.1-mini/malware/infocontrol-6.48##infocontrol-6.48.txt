      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an invocation of a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com). This behavior is characteristic of malware attempting to stealthily download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup script, likely used as a disguise to hide the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly downloading and executing malware.",
