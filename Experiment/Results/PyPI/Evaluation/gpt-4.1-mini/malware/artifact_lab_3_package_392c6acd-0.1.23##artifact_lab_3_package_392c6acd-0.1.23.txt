      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell, which is a common malicious technique used to gain unauthorized remote access to a victim's machine. It creates a socket connection to a remote server (host: 6.tcp.eu.ngrok.io, port: 13334) and redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to this socket. Then, it spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh) connected to the remote server. This allows the remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system with the privileges of the running process, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, or further malware deployment.",
