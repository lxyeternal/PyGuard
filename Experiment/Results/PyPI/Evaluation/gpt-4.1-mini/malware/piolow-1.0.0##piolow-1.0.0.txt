      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command (GruppeInstall) that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a piece of encrypted Python code using a Fernet symmetric encryption key. The encrypted payload is embedded directly in the source code and executed via exec(). This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malicious code because it hides the actual payload from static analysis by encrypting it and only decrypting it at runtime. The use of exec() on decrypted data can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing the attacker to run any code on the victim's machine during installation. The purpose and exact nature of the decrypted payload are not visible in the provided code, but the mechanism strongly suggests an attempt to conceal malicious actions such as downloading further malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. Therefore, this code is malicious due to its encrypted payload execution during installation, which is a common technique used to evade detection and perform harmful actions.",
