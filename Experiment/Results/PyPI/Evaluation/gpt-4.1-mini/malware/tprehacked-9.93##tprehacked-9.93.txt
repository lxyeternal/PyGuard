      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to run unauthorized commands or download and execute payloads. The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' (a suspicious domain) further suggests malicious intent. The setup() call appears to be a decoy to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installer, while the real payload is the hidden PowerShell command execution. This can lead to unauthorized code execution, potential system compromise, or downloading additional malicious software.",
