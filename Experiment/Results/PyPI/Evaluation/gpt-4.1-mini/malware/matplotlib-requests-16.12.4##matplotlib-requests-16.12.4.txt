      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code masquerades as a harmless Python package setup script but contains hidden malicious behavior. After the setup call, it checks for the existence of a file named 'hifromDreamyOak' and exits if it exists, likely as a rudimentary persistence or anti-analysis check. Then, it imports the 'requests' library and uses base64 decoding to decode and execute a hidden payload. The decoded payload imports 'os', checks if the 'list' exception exits (which is a nonsensical check likely to cause an exception and exit), then imports 'requests' again, defines a URL pointing to a suspicious executable hosted on Discord's CDN, downloads this executable, writes it to a temporary file, and executes it using subprocess.call. This behavior indicates that the script downloads and runs a potentially malicious Windows executable from an external source without user consent, which is a clear sign of malware. The purpose is likely to infect the host system with malware, potentially leading to unauthorized control, data theft, or other harmful effects.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL (hosted on Discord's CDN) and saves it to a temporary file on the local system. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using subprocess.call. This behavior is highly suspicious and typical of malware or malicious scripts that attempt to fetch and run potentially harmful binaries without user consent. The downloaded executable could perform any number of harmful actions, such as installing malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. Since the code executes an external binary from an untrusted source without any validation or user interaction, it poses a significant security risk.",
