      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command passed as a base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is decoded and executed by PowerShell without user knowledge or consent. The command is only run if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution or detection. The use of hidden execution and encoded commands is a common technique to conceal malicious payloads or actions. Although the exact decoded PowerShell command is not directly visible in the code, the obfuscation and execution method strongly indicate malicious intent, such as downloading or executing further malware, establishing persistence, or performing unauthorized actions on the system. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely to disguise the script as a legitimate package installer.",
