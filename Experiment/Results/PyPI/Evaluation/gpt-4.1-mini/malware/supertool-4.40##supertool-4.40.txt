      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or connect to remote servers covertly. Specifically, the command references a URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and downloads or executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden window. This indicates the code is trying to download and run an executable from a remote source, which is a common vector for malware infection, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a typical Python setup script, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate.",
