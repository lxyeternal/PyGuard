      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command (GruppeInstall) that executes during the package installation process on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a piece of encrypted Python code using a Fernet symmetric encryption key. The decrypted code is executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the actual payload from static analysis. The use of encrypted payloads executed at install time is a common technique to evade detection and deliver malicious functionality. The exact behavior of the decrypted payload is not visible in the source, but the pattern strongly suggests that it could perform unauthorized actions such as downloading additional malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. This behavior is malicious because it executes hidden code without user consent or transparency, potentially harming the user's system or data.",
