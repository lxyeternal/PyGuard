      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class GruppeInstall that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is decrypted and executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of obfuscated and potentially harmful behavior. This technique is commonly used to hide malicious payloads from static analysis. The decrypted code is not visible in the source, but the use of encrypted execution during installation strongly suggests that the package attempts to run hidden code on the user's machine without explicit consent. This can lead to unauthorized actions such as downloading malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. Therefore, this code is malicious due to its use of encrypted payload execution during installation, which is a typical vector for malware delivery.",
