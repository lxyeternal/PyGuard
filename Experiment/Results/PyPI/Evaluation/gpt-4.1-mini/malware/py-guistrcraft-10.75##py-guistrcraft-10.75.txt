      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from the URL 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0'. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and run a potentially harmful executable from the internet without user consent. The use of obfuscation (Base64 encoded command), hidden window execution, and conditional execution based on the presence of a directory strongly indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload.",
