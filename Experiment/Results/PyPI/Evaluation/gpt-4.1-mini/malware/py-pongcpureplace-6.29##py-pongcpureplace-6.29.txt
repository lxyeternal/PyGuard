      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The script checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. The URL embedded in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the author email (tahgoficial@proton.me) suggest a suspicious source. The PowerShell command likely downloads or executes additional payloads or performs unauthorized actions on the system. Running hidden encoded PowerShell commands is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute malicious payloads. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily executing potentially harmful commands on the victim's machine.",
