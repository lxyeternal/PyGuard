      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is suspicious and typical of malware trying to run a payload or perform unauthorized actions on the system. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs the hidden PowerShell command. The use of hidden window style and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and hide malicious activity. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear benign. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at executing hidden PowerShell commands that could compromise the system.",
