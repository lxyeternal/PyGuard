      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is malicious. It is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding and string concatenation, including base64 and custom encoding schemes. The code dynamically imports numerous modules related to system operations, networking, asynchronous HTTP requests, and cryptographic functions. It defines a class 'PartyBot' that appears to manage a persistent event loop, perform HTTP requests, and interact with external servers. The code sends and receives data to and from suspicious external URLs (e.g., 'zuppa.cousinfn.com'), including posting sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and system details. It also includes functionality to execute system commands, clear system states, and manipulate user sessions. The presence of functions named like 'kick', 'stop', 'copy', 'pickaxe', and 'raiders' combined with network communication and system command execution strongly indicates that this code is designed to control or manipulate a victim's machine remotely, potentially for unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or as part of a botnet. The obfuscation and use of asynchronous event loops to maintain persistent connections further support the conclusion that this is malware intended to stealthily compromise and control systems.",
