      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL and saves it to a hidden location within the user's AppData\\Local directory under the name 'explorer.exe'. It then executes this downloaded file. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to stealthily download and run potentially harmful software on the victim's machine without their consent. The use of a system-like filename ('explorer.exe') in a non-standard location is a common tactic to evade casual detection. The downloaded executable could perform any number of malicious actions, such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or compromising system integrity.",
