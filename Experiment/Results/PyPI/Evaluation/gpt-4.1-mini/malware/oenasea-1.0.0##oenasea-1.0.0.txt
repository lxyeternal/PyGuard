      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process. During installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted at runtime, then executed via exec(). This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malware or backdoor code, as it hides the actual payload and executes it without user knowledge. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution is a common technique to evade detection and analysis. The exact nature of the decrypted payload is not visible in the code, but the mechanism indicates an intent to run potentially harmful or unauthorized code during package installation, which can compromise the system's security.",
