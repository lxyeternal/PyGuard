      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' module and a 'Fernet' class from a 'fernet' package, then decrypts and executes a payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and ciphertext. This decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior because it runs hidden, encrypted code without user knowledge or consent. The obfuscation of the class name, the use of encrypted payload, and the conditional execution only on Windows systems suggest an attempt to hide malicious actions. The exact payload is not visible in the source, but the pattern strongly indicates that the code is designed to execute potentially harmful or unauthorized actions on the victim's machine during package installation. This behavior can lead to unauthorized code execution, data theft, system compromise, or other malicious outcomes.",
