      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including base64, zlib compression, and character code transformations, to hide its true functionality. It dynamically constructs and executes code at runtime using eval and exec, which is a common technique used in malicious scripts to evade detection and analysis. The code imports modules and sets attributes dynamically, and the obfuscation includes suspicious strings and encoded payloads that are decompressed and decoded before execution. Such behavior is typical of malware or backdoor scripts that attempt to hide their actions, potentially to execute unauthorized commands, download or execute further malicious payloads, or compromise the host system. Due to the complexity and obfuscation, the exact payload is not trivially visible, but the use of dynamic code execution combined with heavy obfuscation strongly indicates malicious intent.",

It dynamically constructs and executes code at runtime using eval and exec, which is a common technique used in malicious scripts to evade detection and analysis. The code imports modules and sets attributes dynamically, and the obfuscation prevents straightforward understanding of its behavior without full deobfuscation. Given these characteristics—heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and encoded payloads—the code is very likely designed to perform unauthorized or harmful actions, such as executing hidden commands, downloading or running malware, or compromising the host system. Therefore, it should be treated as malicious.",
