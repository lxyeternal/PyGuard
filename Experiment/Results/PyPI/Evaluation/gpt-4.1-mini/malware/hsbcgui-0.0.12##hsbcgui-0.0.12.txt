      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads and executes an external executable file named 'DigitalPulse.exe' from the URL 'https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe' during the installation process on Windows platforms. This behavior is triggered by overriding the standard install command to run the 'app()' function, which performs the download and execution. Downloading and running an executable from an untrusted external source without user consent is a common vector for malware distribution. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine, potentially compromising system security, stealing data, or installing further malicious payloads.",
