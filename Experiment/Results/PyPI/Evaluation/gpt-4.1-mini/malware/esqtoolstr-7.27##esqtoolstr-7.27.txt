      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This command is only run if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution or detection. The PowerShell command appears to invoke a web request to download or execute a file from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com), which is a common technique used to fetch and run malicious payloads remotely. The use of hidden window style and encoded commands is typical in malware to evade detection and user awareness. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. Overall, this behavior is indicative of malware designed to silently download and execute potentially harmful code on the victim's machine.",
