      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an invocation of a web request to download and execute a file from 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0' and save it as '~\\WindowsCache.exe', then execute it. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent. The presence of the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' further suggests an attempt to disguise or brand the malicious payload. Overall, this code is malicious as it tries to stealthily download and execute an external executable, which can compromise system security.",
