      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically downloads and executes Python code from a remote URL (https://rentry.co/277t2/raw) without any validation or user consent. It writes a small script to a temporary file that imports and runs code fetched from the internet, then attempts to execute this script using a Python interpreter variant (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe' to likely run without a console window). This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper malware, as it can execute arbitrary code controlled by a remote attacker. The downloaded code could perform any malicious actions such as data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation. The use of a temporary file and indirect execution obscures the payload and evades simple static detection.",
