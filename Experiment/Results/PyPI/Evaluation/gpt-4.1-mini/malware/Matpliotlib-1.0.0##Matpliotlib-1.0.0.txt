      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior embedded in the custom install command class for setuptools. Specifically, during installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of obfuscated malicious code. This behavior is suspicious because it runs hidden code during package installation without user consent or transparency. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution is a common technique to evade detection and analysis. The exact nature of the decrypted payload is not visible in the source, but the pattern strongly suggests it could perform unauthorized actions such as downloading additional malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. Therefore, this code is malicious and should not be trusted or installed.",
