      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The script checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden command. The decoded command appears to invoke a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious domain 'dl.dropbox.com' under a path '/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0'. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and execute a payload from the internet without user consent, potentially compromising the system. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily downloading and executing a potentially harmful executable.",
