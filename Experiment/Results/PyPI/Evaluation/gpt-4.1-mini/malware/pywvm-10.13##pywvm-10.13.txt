      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or connect to remote servers covertly. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs the PowerShell command, which suggests it tries to avoid repeated execution or detection. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. The use of hidden PowerShell execution and encoded commands is a strong indicator of malicious intent, potentially allowing remote code execution, downloading additional malware, or establishing persistence on the system.",
