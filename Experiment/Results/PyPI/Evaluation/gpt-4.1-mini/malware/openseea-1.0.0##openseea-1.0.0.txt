      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows execution of arbitrary code hidden from static analysis. The exact behavior of the decrypted payload is not visible in the source, but this pattern is commonly used to hide malware or backdoors that run during installation. This can lead to unauthorized actions on the victim's machine, such as data theft, remote control, or further malware downloads. The obfuscation of class names, package metadata, and the encrypted payload further supports the conclusion that this is malicious code designed to evade detection.",
