      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com with a specific path). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run a payload silently on the victim's machine, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, which appears benign but is likely a cover or delivery mechanism for the malicious payload. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily downloading and executing a potentially harmful executable.",
