      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com). This behavior is characteristic of malware attempting to silently download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent. The rest of the code is a setup script that appears benign but is likely a disguise to hide the malicious payload execution. The presence of hidden execution, encoded commands, and downloading executables from untrusted sources confirms the code is malicious and poses a security risk.",
