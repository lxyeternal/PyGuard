      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior embedded in the custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it executes arbitrary code that is hidden from static analysis. This behavior can be used to run unauthorized or harmful code on the victim's machine during package installation, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities. The obfuscation of the class name and meaningless description strings further suggest an attempt to hide the true purpose of the code.",
