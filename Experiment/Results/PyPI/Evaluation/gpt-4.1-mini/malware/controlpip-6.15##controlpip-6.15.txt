      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or connect to remote servers covertly. Specifically, the command references a URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and attempts to download or execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden window. This indicates the code is trying to download and run an executable from a remote source without user consent, which is a clear malicious action. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. Overall, the code contains hidden execution of a potentially harmful payload, making it malicious.",
