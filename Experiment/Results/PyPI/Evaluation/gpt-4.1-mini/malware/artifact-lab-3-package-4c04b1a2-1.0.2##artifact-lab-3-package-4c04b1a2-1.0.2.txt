      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to exfiltrate environment variables from the user's system during the installation of the package. It overrides the standard setuptools install command to run a custom payload immediately after installation. The payload collects all environment variables, encodes them, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a remote server hosted on an Ngrok URL. This behavior is malicious because environment variables often contain sensitive information such as API keys, credentials, tokens, and other secrets. By sending this data to an attacker-controlled server without user consent, the code compromises user privacy and security.",
