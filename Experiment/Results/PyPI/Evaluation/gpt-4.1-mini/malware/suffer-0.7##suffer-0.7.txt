      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code uses the 'pytransform' module and calls 'pyarmor_runtime()', followed by a call to '__pyarmor__' with a large byte string argument. This pattern is characteristic of code protected or obfuscated by PyArmor, a tool used to encrypt and obfuscate Python scripts to prevent reverse engineering. While PyArmor itself is a legitimate tool, the presence of such heavy obfuscation and encrypted payloads is a common technique used by malware authors to hide malicious code. Without decrypting the payload, it is impossible to determine the exact behavior, but the obfuscation strongly suggests an attempt to conceal potentially harmful actions such as unauthorized data access, code injection, or other malicious activities. Therefore, this code is considered malicious due to its obfuscated nature and use of encrypted runtime execution, which is a common hallmark of malware.",
