      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command passed as a base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command decodes to a PowerShell invocation that runs a remote executable downloaded from a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as ~\\WindowsCache.exe, then executes it. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) and hiding the PowerShell window further indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard Python setup script, likely used as a decoy or to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package.",
