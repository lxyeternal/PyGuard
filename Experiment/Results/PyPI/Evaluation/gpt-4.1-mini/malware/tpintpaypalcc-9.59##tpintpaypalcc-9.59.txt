      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) in a hidden manner. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and run a payload from the internet without user consent. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoded PowerShell command), hidden execution, and downloading an executable from an untrusted source strongly indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup script that appears to be a decoy or a cover to disguise the malicious payload execution.",
