      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that, upon installation, collects sensitive information from the user's environment including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a remote server at IP address 9.30.214.68 on port 9090. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, potentially compromising user privacy and security. The code disguises this action within the installation process, making it stealthy and malicious.",
