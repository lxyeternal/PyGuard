      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently download and run a payload from the internet without user consent. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. The presence of the hidden PowerShell execution and remote payload download clearly indicates malicious intent, potentially leading to unauthorized code execution, system compromise, or further malware infection.",
