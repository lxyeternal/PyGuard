      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains obfuscated and encoded payloads that are decoded and executed at runtime. It uses base64 decoding and exec calls to run hidden code, which is a common technique used in malicious scripts to evade detection. The code checks the operating system and executes different base64-decoded payloads accordingly. The payloads include references to system internals, network requests, file operations, and potentially downloading or executing further code. The presence of encoded data, dynamic execution, and system-level operations strongly indicate that this code is designed to perform unauthorized or harmful actions, such as downloading malware, executing arbitrary commands, or compromising the host system. Therefore, this code is malicious and poses a security risk.",
