      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or establish persistence covertly. The script first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs the hidden PowerShell command. The use of hidden window style and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and hide malicious activity. The rest of the code is a typical Python setup script, likely used as a decoy or to appear legitimate. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at executing hidden PowerShell commands on the host system, which can lead to unauthorized control, data exfiltration, or further compromise.",
