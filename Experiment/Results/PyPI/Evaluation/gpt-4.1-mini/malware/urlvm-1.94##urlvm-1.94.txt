      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command passed as a base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is decoded by PowerShell and executed silently without user awareness. The command appears to invoke a PowerShell web request to download and execute a file from an external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and save it as '~\\WindowsCache.exe'. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and run a payload from the internet without user consent, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malicious activity. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within seemingly benign code. Therefore, this code is malicious as it attempts to stealthily download and execute an external executable on the victim's machine.",
