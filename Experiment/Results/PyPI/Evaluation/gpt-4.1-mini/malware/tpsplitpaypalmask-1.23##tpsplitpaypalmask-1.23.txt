      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. This command is base64-encoded and runs only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded command likely downloads or executes a payload from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) or performs other unauthorized actions. The use of hidden window style and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and hide malicious activity. The rest of the code appears to be a decoy setup script for a Python package, possibly to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute potentially harmful commands on the victim's machine, which constitutes malicious behavior.",
