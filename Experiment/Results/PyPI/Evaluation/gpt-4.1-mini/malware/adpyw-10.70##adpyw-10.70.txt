      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads covertly. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution or detection. The use of hidden window style and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and analysis. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at executing hidden PowerShell commands on the host system, which can lead to unauthorized actions, compromise, or persistence.",
