      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command appears to invoke a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) related to 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm...'. The use of hidden execution, encoded commands, and downloading/executing remote content strongly indicates malicious intent. This behavior can lead to unauthorized code execution, potential malware installation, or system compromise without the user's knowledge.",
