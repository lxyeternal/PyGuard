      "malicious_behavior": "This code downloads two executable files from external URLs hosted on Discord's CDN and saves them into a hidden system directory (C:\\$Windows.~SXK) on a Windows machine. It then executes these downloaded executables using os.startfile, which runs the files without user interaction. The directory name and file names are obfuscated to avoid easy detection. After launching the executables, the code attempts to delete the directory containing them. This behavior is characteristic of malware: silently downloading and executing potentially harmful binaries from the internet, which can compromise the system by installing backdoors, stealing data, or performing other malicious actions. The use of a disguised folder in the root of the C drive and the lack of any user prompt or verification further indicate malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code downloads and executes a potentially harmful executable file from a remote URL (hosted on Discord's CDN). It creates a hidden-looking folder named 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK' to disguise itself as a legitimate Windows system folder, then downloads an executable named 'main.exe' from the internet, saves it into this folder under the name 'XMICNEI.exe', and immediately runs it. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to persist on a system by placing malicious payloads in system-like directories and executing them without user consent. The downloaded executable could perform any number of harmful actions such as data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation. The code also attempts to avoid repeated downloads by checking if the folder exists, indicating replication or persistence intent. Overall, this code is malicious as it facilitates the silent download and execution of an unknown and potentially dangerous executable.",
