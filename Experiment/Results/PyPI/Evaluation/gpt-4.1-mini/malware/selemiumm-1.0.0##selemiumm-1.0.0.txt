      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install behavior when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted at runtime, then executed with exec(). This behavior is characteristic of malicious code attempting to hide its true intent by encrypting the payload and only decrypting it during installation. The use of exec() on decrypted data is dangerous as it can execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as downloading malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The obfuscated class name, meaningless description strings, and the requirement of 'fernet' and 'requests' packages further suggest an attempt to disguise malicious intent. Overall, this code is malicious because it executes hidden, encrypted code during installation, which can perform harmful actions on the host system.",
