      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which can run arbitrary Python code. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malicious code because it hides the actual payload inside an encrypted blob, only decrypting and executing it at install time, making static analysis difficult. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution is a common technique to evade detection and deliver malware or perform unauthorized actions on the victim's machine. The code also specifies Windows as the target OS, indicating a targeted attack. Overall, this code is malicious as it executes hidden, encrypted code during installation without user knowledge or consent, potentially leading to compromise of the system.",
