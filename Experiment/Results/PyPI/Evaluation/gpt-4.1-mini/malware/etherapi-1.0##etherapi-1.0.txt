      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically downloads and executes Python code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/qqrbb/raw) without any validation or user consent. It writes a small script to a temporary file that imports and runs code fetched from the internet, then attempts to execute this script using a modified Python executable name. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper malware, which can run arbitrary and potentially harmful code on the victim's machine. The remote code could perform any malicious actions such as data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation. The use of obfuscation techniques like renaming the Python executable and running code from a temporary file further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
