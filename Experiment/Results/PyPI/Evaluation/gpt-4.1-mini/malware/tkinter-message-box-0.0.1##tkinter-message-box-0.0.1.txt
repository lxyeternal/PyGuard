      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to stealthily collect sensitive user data from the Telegram Desktop application by accessing the 'tdata' directory within the user's APPDATA folder. It searches for specific folders and files that match Telegram's data storage patterns (folders with 16 uppercase characters and files with specific naming conventions). It then compresses these files into an in-memory ZIP archive. Subsequently, the code sends this ZIP archive to a remote Telegram bot via a POST request, effectively exfiltrating potentially sensitive Telegram user data such as session information, keys, or cached messages. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data theft and privacy violation, which is malicious. The inclusion of setuptools.setup() with unrelated package metadata appears to be an attempt to disguise or legitimize the script.",
