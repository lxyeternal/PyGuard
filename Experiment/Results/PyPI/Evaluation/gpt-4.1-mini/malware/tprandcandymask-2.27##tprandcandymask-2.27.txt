      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from the URL 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0'. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently download and run a potentially harmful executable from the internet without user consent or knowledge. The use of obfuscation (Base64 encoded command) and hidden window execution further indicates an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script.",
