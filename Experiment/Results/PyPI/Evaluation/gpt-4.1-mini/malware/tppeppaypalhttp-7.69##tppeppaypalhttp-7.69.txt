      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This PowerShell command invokes a web request to download and execute a file from an external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as '~\\WindowsCache.exe'. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent or knowledge. The use of obfuscation (Base64 encoded command), hidden window execution, and downloading an executable from an untrusted source strongly indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the script as a legitimate package, but the primary malicious action is the silent download and execution of an external executable.",
