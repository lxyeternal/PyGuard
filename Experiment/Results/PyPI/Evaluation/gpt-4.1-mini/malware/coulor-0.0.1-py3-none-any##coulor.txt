      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a temporary Python script file that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://discock.netlify.app/discock/nigger) without user consent. It uses urllib to fetch the remote script and executes it immediately. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper malware, which can run arbitrary and potentially harmful code fetched from the internet. The use of a temporary file and launching a new Python interpreter process to run the downloaded code further obscures the activity. The remote code could perform any malicious actions such as data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation. Additionally, the URL and naming suggest offensive and suspicious intent.",
