      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a malicious token grabber and credential stealer targeting Windows systems, specifically focusing on Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, and Google Chrome saved passwords and cookies. It performs the following harmful actions:\n\n1. **Discord Token Theft:** It scans various Discord and Chromium-based browser local storage directories for Discord authentication tokens using regex patterns. It also decrypts encrypted tokens using the Windows CryptUnprotectData API and AES decryption with the Chrome master key.\n\n2. **Credential Theft:** It extracts saved passwords and cookies from Google Chrome by copying the browser's SQLite databases, decrypting stored credentials using the master key, and saving them to text files.\n\n3. **Roblox Cookie Theft:** It attempts to extract Roblox security cookies from Windows registry keys.\n\n4. **Discord Injection:** It downloads a JavaScript payload from a remote URL and injects it into Discord's desktop core files, potentially for persistent malicious control or further exploitation.\n\n5. **Anti-Protection Measures:** It attempts to disable or bypass Discord token protection tools and BetterDiscord integrity checks by modifying or deleting their files and configurations.\n\n6. **Process Manipulation:** Optionally kills Discord-related processes to facilitate injection or token grabbing.\n\n7. **Persistence and Stealth:** It can copy itself to the Windows startup folder to run on system boot and hide its executable file by setting hidden attributes.\n\n8. **Data Exfiltration:** It collects system information (Windows product key, IP address, hardware specs, location) and bundles all stolen data into a zip archive, then sends this archive along with detailed embeds containing stolen tokens and system info to a remote Discord webhook.\n\nOverall, this code is designed to stealthily steal sensitive user credentials and tokens, enabling attackers to hijack Discord accounts, browser sessions, and Roblox accounts, potentially leading to account takeovers, identity theft, and unauthorized access. The use of Discord webhooks for exfiltration and injection of malicious scripts into Discord clients further amplifies its threat.",
