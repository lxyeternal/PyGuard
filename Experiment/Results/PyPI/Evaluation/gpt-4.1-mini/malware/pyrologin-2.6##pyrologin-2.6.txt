      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clearly malicious behavior. It checks if the directory 'C:/ProgramData/Updater' exists, and if not, it downloads a ZIP archive from an external URL (https://transfer.sh/QuUD3Q/Updater.zip) to the temporary folder, extracts it to 'C:/ProgramData', and removes the ZIP file. Then it silently installs a large number of Python packages, some of which can be used for automation, keylogging, cryptography, and system interaction (e.g., pydirectinput, pynput, pycryptodome, keyring, pyperclip). After that, it runs a VBScript and a Python script ('server.pyw') from the extracted folder, both launched in hidden windows. This behavior is typical of malware that installs a persistent backdoor or keylogger, hides its presence, and potentially steals sensitive information or controls the system remotely. The use of base64-decoded code to define a 'run' function that executes shell commands further obfuscates the malicious intent. Overall, this code acts as a dropper and installer for malicious payloads, posing a significant security risk.",
