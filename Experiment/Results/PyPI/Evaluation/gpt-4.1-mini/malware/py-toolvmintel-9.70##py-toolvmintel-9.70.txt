      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. The command references a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and attempts to run a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden window. This behavior is indicative of malware or a backdoor attempting to download or execute a payload covertly. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and user awareness. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, likely to disguise the malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly executing potentially harmful software on the victim's machine.",
