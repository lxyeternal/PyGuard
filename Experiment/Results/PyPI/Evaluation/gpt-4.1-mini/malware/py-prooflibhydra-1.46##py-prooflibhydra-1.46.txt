      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The script checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. The encoded command appears to invoke a web request to download or execute a file from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) related to 'dl.dropbox.com' and 's/ szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe'. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and execute a payload from the internet covertly. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the script as a legitimate package. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily downloading and executing a potentially harmful executable, which can compromise the system's security.",
