      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from an external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as '~\\WindowsCache.exe'. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to silently download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent or knowledge. The use of a hidden window and encoded command is intended to evade detection and user awareness. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears benign but is likely a decoy or part of the malicious package. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at silently downloading and executing a potentially harmful payload.",
