      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This PowerShell command invokes a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe). The execution is done silently without user consent or awareness. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run a payload from the internet, potentially compromising the system by installing malicious software. The rest of the code appears to be a decoy setup script for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious intent.",
