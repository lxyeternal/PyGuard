      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the host details (via os.uname), the user's home directory path, environment variables, and the current working directory. It then serializes this data into JSON, encodes it in base64, and sends it via an HTTP POST request to an external server disguised as 'pypi.org' but with a suspicious 'Host' header 'psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net'. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, where potentially sensitive environment and system information is being sent to a remote server without user consent. Such actions can be used for reconnaissance by attackers to gather information about the victim's system for further exploitation or tracking, which is a malicious activity.",
