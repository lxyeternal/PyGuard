      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The script checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. The presence of the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a connection to a potentially suspicious source. The PowerShell command likely downloads or executes a payload from an external source (the decoded command references a URL 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm...'), which is a common technique used by malware to fetch and run malicious code. The use of hidden window style and encoded commands is a typical evasion technique to avoid detection by users and some security tools. Overall, this behavior is characteristic of malware or a backdoor attempting to silently download and execute code on the victim's machine.",
