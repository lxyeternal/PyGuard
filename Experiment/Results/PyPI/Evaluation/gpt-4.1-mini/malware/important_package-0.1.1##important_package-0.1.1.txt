      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including the host details (via os.uname), the user's home directory path, and the current working directory. It then encodes this information in base64 and sends it as a query parameter to an external URL (https://pypi.org/reqs?d=...) with a forged Host header ('psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net'). This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration or reconnaissance, where sensitive environment details are stealthily sent to a remote server. The use of a legitimate domain (pypi.org) with a suspicious query and a forged Host header suggests an attempt to evade detection or blend in with normal traffic. Such actions can compromise user privacy and security by leaking system information without user consent.",
