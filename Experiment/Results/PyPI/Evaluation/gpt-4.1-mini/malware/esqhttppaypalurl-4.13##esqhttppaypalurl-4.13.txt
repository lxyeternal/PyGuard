      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor scripts that try to download or execute additional payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the victim's machine. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common technique to avoid repeated execution or detection. The rest of the code appears to be a decoy setup script for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, this code is malicious as it attempts to run hidden, encoded PowerShell commands that could compromise the system.",
