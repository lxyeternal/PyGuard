      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that collects sensitive system information during installation, including the machine's public IP address, hostname, and current working directory. It then sends this information to a remote server (https://hj4r3z33cahfqit5kmmh1mgn3e95x4lt.oastify.com) without user consent. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration and violates user privacy. The collected data could be used for tracking, profiling, or further malicious activities. Embedding such data collection in an installation script is a common tactic in malicious packages to stealthily gather information from victims.",
