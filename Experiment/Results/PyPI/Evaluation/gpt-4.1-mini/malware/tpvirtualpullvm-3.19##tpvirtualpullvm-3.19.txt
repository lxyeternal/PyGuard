      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The script is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution. The PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and downloads or executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and run a payload covertly, potentially compromising the system by executing unauthorized code, downloading further malicious components, or establishing persistence. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the script as a legitimate package. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly executing a hidden PowerShell payload that could harm the system.",
