      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com). This behavior is characteristic of malware or a trojan downloader, as it silently downloads and runs an executable from the internet without user consent or visibility. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. The primary malicious behavior is the covert download and execution of a potentially harmful executable, which can compromise the system, install malware, or perform unauthorized actions.",
