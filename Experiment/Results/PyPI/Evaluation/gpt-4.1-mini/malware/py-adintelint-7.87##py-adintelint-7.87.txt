      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that try to run potentially harmful or unauthorized commands on the victim's machine. The script first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs the encoded PowerShell command. The presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly indicate malicious intent. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or an attempt to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package setup script. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute potentially harmful commands on a Windows system, which constitutes malicious behavior.",
