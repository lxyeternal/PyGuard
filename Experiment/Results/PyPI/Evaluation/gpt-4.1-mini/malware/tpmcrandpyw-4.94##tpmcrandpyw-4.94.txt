      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This PowerShell command invokes a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com link with query parameters). The presence of the hidden execution, encoded command, and external download from an untrusted source strongly indicates malicious intent. The purpose of this behavior is likely to silently download and run malware or unauthorized software on the victim's machine without their knowledge. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, which is a common tactic to disguise malicious payload delivery.",
