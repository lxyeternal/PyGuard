      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that is base64-encoded and zlib-compressed, which is then decompressed and executed at runtime using exec(). This technique is commonly used to hide malicious code from casual inspection. The decoded payload is not directly visible in the source, but the use of such obfuscation strongly indicates an attempt to conceal harmful behavior. Additionally, the setup() call defines a package named 'rushbruhmalware' with a description explicitly stating 'this is a malware, please dont install this', confirming the intent. The malicious behavior likely involves executing hidden code that could perform unauthorized actions such as data theft, system compromise, or other harmful effects once the package is installed or run.",
