      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a sophisticated malicious software (malware) designed primarily as a credential and data stealer targeting Windows systems. It performs the following malicious actions:\n\n1. **Credential Theft:** It extracts sensitive data such as saved passwords, cookies, credit card information, and browsing history from multiple browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, Firefox, and others). It decrypts encrypted passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption with master keys extracted from browser local state files.\n\n2. **Discord Token Stealing:** The code searches for Discord tokens stored in various Discord clients and browsers, validates them by querying Discord API, and collects user information associated with these tokens.\n\n3. **Clipboard Hijacking for Cryptocurrency Addresses:** It monitors the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet addresses and replaces them with attacker-controlled addresses to hijack cryptocurrency transactions.\n\n4. **System Information Gathering:** It collects detailed system information including Windows product key, version, hardware UUID, IP address, geolocation, RAM, disk size, and running processes.\n\n5. **Anti-Debugging and Anti-VM Checks:** The code attempts to detect if it is running in a virtual machine or debugging environment by checking for known VM artifacts, usernames, PC names, IP addresses, and hardware IDs, and exits if detected.\n\n6. **Persistence:** It copies itself to the Windows startup folder to achieve persistence on the infected machine.\n\n7. **Process Killing:** Optionally kills Discord and related processes to avoid detection or interference.\n\n8. **Data Exfiltration:** All stolen data (passwords, cookies, tokens, system info, screenshots, Roblox cookies, Minecraft files, etc.) is compressed into a zip file and exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to attacker-controlled webhooks and URLs (notably to domains like kekwltd.ru).\n\n9. **File Searching and Uploading:** It searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files with keywords related to passwords, wallets, tokens, and uploads them anonymously to a file-sharing service.\n\n10. **Screenshot Capture:** Takes screenshots of the victim's desktop.\n\nOverall, this code is a fully featured information stealer and clipboard hijacker designed to compromise user credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, Discord accounts, and other sensitive data, then send it to an attacker-controlled server. Its presence on a system represents a severe security threat and privacy violation.",
