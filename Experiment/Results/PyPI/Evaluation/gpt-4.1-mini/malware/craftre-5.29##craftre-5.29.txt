      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads covertly. The script first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and only if it does not, it runs the PowerShell command. The exact decoded command appears to invoke a web request to download or execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a remote URL (dl.dropbox.com), which is a common technique for downloading and running malicious payloads. Running such a command can lead to unauthorized code execution, system compromise, data theft, or installation of persistent malware. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script.",
