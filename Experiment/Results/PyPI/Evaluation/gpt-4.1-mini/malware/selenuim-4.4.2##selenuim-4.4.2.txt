      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs unauthorized network communication and downloads and executes a potentially harmful executable. Specifically, during the installation process, it sends a GET request to an external server (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php) with the environment variable COMPUTERNAME, potentially leaking sensitive information about the user's machine. Then, if the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable file from https://python-release.com/python-install.scr, saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe', and executes it using the system command 'start'. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently download and run malicious payloads on the victim's machine without user consent, posing significant security risks including system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation.",
