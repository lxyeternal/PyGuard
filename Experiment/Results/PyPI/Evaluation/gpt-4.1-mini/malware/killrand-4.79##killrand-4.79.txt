      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an invocation of a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a remote URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to stealthily download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent or knowledge. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. Therefore, this code is malicious as it attempts to silently download and execute an external executable, which can compromise system security.",
