      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (AfterInstall) that overrides the standard install command in setuptools. During the installation process of this Python package, it executes the function 'notmalfunc', which decodes a base64-encoded string and runs it as a shell command via os.system. The decoded command is 'echo hola que tal > true.xml', which creates or overwrites a file named 'true.xml' with the text 'hola que tal'. While this specific payload is relatively harmless (just writing a text file), the technique used is a common pattern in malicious Python packages: executing arbitrary shell commands during installation. This can be easily modified to run harmful commands, making the package potentially dangerous. Therefore, the code exhibits malicious behavior by executing hidden shell commands during installation, which can be exploited to perform unauthorized actions on the user's system.",
