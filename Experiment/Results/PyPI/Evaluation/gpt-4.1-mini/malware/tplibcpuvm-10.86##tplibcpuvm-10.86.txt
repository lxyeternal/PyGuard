      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This PowerShell command invokes a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as ~\\WindowsCache.exe. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent or knowledge. The rest of the code tries to masquerade as a legitimate Python package setup script, likely to evade casual inspection. The presence of the hidden download and execution of an external executable clearly indicates malicious intent.",
