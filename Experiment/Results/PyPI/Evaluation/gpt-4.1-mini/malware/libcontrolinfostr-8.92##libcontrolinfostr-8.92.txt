      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'WindowStyle Hidden' option and an encoded command string. This command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command, when decoded from Base64 UTF-16LE, appears to invoke a web request to download and execute a file from 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0' and save it as '~\\WindowsCache.exe', then execute it. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to silently download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious intent. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily downloading and executing a remote payload, which can compromise system security.",
