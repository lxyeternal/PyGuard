      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including base64 and other transformations. It uses the 'eval' function to execute dynamically decoded code, which is a common technique in malicious scripts to hide their true intent. The code imports modules like 'base64', 'codecs', and 'bytes', and performs complex decoding operations on large encoded byte strings. The final execution involves decoding and decompressing data, then executing it, which strongly indicates that the script is designed to run hidden or unauthorized payloads. Such behavior is typical of malware, backdoors, or trojans that aim to evade detection by obfuscation and dynamic code execution. The potential harm includes unauthorized code execution, data theft, system compromise, or other malicious activities depending on the hidden payload. Therefore, this code is malicious.",
