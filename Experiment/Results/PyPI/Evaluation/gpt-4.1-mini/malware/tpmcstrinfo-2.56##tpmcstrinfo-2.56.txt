      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor scripts that try to download or execute additional payloads from a remote server. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the use of a suspicious domain in the encoded command suggest it is trying to connect to or download something from a potentially malicious source. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which may be an evasion or persistence technique. Overall, this code is malicious as it attempts to stealthily execute a potentially harmful PowerShell payload, which could compromise the system.",
