      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and a package identifier, then encodes this data in base64 and further hex-encodes it. It then exfiltrates this information by sending it covertly to a remote server controlled by an attacker via multiple methods: by pinging specially crafted subdomains (DNS exfiltration technique) and by making HTTP POST and GET requests to a suspicious domain (deliverycontent.online). The use of DNS queries for data exfiltration is a known stealth technique to bypass network monitoring. The data sent can be used to fingerprint the infected machine and user environment. This behavior is characteristic of spyware or reconnaissance malware designed to gather and leak system information without user consent, which constitutes malicious activity.",
