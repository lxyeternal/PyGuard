      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. The command is only run if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution. The decoded PowerShell command appears to invoke a web request to download or execute a remote payload from a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and save or run a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and execute additional malicious payloads on the victim's machine, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to facilitate installation. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily downloading and executing a remote executable on a Windows system.",
