      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that, upon installation, creates a reverse shell connection to a remote server at IP address 39.101.72.63 on port 4242. It does this by opening a socket connection to the remote host, redirecting the standard input, output, and error file descriptors to the socket, and then launching an interactive shell (/bin/sh). This effectively gives the remote server full command-line access to the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running the installation. Such behavior is highly malicious as it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, or further malware deployment.",
