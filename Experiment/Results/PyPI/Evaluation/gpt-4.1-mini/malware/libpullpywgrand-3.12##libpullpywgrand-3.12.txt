      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes a payload from a remote URL (dl.dropbox.com) and runs a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' silently. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and execute malicious software on the victim's machine without user consent or knowledge. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup script, possibly used as a disguise or to appear benign, but the hidden PowerShell execution is clearly malicious and intended to compromise the system.",
