      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This command appears to invoke a web request to a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and downloads or executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. The presence of the hidden window style, encoded command, and execution of an external executable from an untrusted source strongly indicates malicious intent. This behavior can lead to unauthorized code execution, potential malware installation, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate.",
