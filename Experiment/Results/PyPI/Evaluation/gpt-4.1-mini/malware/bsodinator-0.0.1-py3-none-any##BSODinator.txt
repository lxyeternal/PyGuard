      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple functions that can cause harm or disruption to a user's system. Specifically:\n\n1. Multiple_img_Downloader: Downloads a very large number (default 10,000) of large images (5000x10000 pixels) concurrently, which can consume excessive bandwidth, disk space, and system resources.\n\n2. Create_Files: Creates a large number (default 10,000) of files, potentially filling up disk space.\n\n3. Delete_Files: Attempts to delete all files in the current directory using shutil.rmtree, which is intended for directories. This can cause errors or unintended deletion if misused.\n\n4. Spam_Windows and Spam_Linux: Opens a very large number (default 10,000) of command prompt or terminal windows, which can overwhelm system resources and cause the system to become unresponsive.\n\n5. ShutdownOnStart: Writes a Python script to the Windows startup folder that immediately shuts down the computer on startup, compiles it into an executable, and cleans up the build files. This is a direct malicious payload designed to cause system shutdown without user consent.\n\n6. Crash_by_Numbers: Runs an infinite loop that exponentially increases the size of numpy arrays and prints them, which will quickly consume all available memory and crash the system.\n\n7. Open_BrowserWins: Opens a very large number (default 10,000) of browser windows/tabs to Google, which can overwhelm system resources.\n\nOverall, the code is designed to disrupt normal system operation, consume resources excessively, delete files, and forcibly shut down the system. These behaviors are malicious as they can cause data loss, system instability, and denial of service.",
