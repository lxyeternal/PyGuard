      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and encryption to conceal its true functionality. It imports modules such as base64, marshal, zlib, and cryptography.fernet, and defines a lambda function to decompress and deserialize data. The code contains a large base64-encoded and reversed string (__mikey__) used as a key for Fernet symmetric encryption, and another large hex-encoded string (mydata) which is decrypted and decoded through several steps. Ultimately, the code executes dynamically generated code obtained after multiple decoding and decryption steps. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code designed to evade detection by hiding its payload. The use of Fernet encryption with a hardcoded key, combined with multiple encoding layers and dynamic execution, strongly indicates that the code is intended to execute hidden, potentially harmful operations such as downloading malware, establishing backdoors, or stealing information. Due to the obfuscation and dynamic execution, the exact payload cannot be determined without further runtime analysis, but the structure and techniques used are consistent with malware.",
