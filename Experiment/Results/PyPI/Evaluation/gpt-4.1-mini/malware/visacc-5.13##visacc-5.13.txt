      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor scripts that try to execute potentially harmful commands or download and run additional payloads without user consent. The use of 'WindowStyle Hidden' and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and hide malicious activity. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear benign. Overall, the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands indicates malicious intent, potentially to compromise the system or execute unauthorized actions.",
