      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or download and run additional malicious code. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common technique to avoid repeated execution or detection. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, likely to disguise the malicious payload. The presence of a suspicious URL in a comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of an email address (tahgoficial@proton.me) further suggest malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute potentially harmful PowerShell commands on a Windows system, which constitutes malicious behavior.",
