      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior hidden inside the custom install command of a Python package setup script. Specifically, it uses base64 decoding and exec to run obfuscated code during the installation process. This decoded code attempts to access the Windows Start Menu Programs directory for the current user and writes a Windows Script Host (WSH) shell script file named 'WIN32.vbs'. The script then runs this VBS script with administrative privileges and executes a command to silently download and run an executable file from a remote URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1152716280571375626/1249682250782478396/build_1.exe) with the argument 'ex=666830ca&is=6666df4a&hm=8b5329d678ac043154f656dc917956a923ec59125b0ce4d00a2436665a842db3'. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to persist on the system by placing scripts in startup folders and downloading/running potentially harmful executables without user consent. The code also attempts to run the script with elevated privileges, increasing the risk of system compromise. Overall, this is a clear example of malicious code designed to stealthily install and execute malware on a Windows system during package installation.",
