      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including base64 and hex escapes, and dynamic evaluation via eval. It imports built-in functions and modules in a disguised manner, then decodes and executes a large encoded payload. The payload appears to be a binary or encrypted blob that is decoded and then executed as code. Such obfuscation and dynamic execution are common techniques used in malicious scripts to hide their true intent and evade detection. The code likely executes hidden malicious payloads, which could include unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Due to the obfuscation and dynamic execution, it poses a security risk and should be treated as malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code sends a notification to a Discord webhook URL every time a package is installed, including the package's project name. This behavior can be considered malicious because it leaks information about the user's environment and installed packages to a third party without user consent. Such data exfiltration can be used for tracking, profiling, or further targeted attacks. Additionally, the webhook URL is hardcoded, which indicates intentional data transmission to an external server controlled by the attacker.",

It imports built-in functions and modules in a disguised manner, then decodes and executes a large encoded payload. The payload appears to be a binary or compressed data blob that is decoded and then executed as code. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious code designed to hide its true intent and evade detection.
