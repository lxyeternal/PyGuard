      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run a payload without user knowledge. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package with misleading metadata, likely to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, this code is malicious as it downloads and executes potentially harmful software from an untrusted source, which can compromise the system.",
