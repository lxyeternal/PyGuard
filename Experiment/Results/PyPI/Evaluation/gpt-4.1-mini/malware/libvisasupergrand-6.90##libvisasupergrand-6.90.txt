      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that try to run unauthorized or harmful commands on the victim's machine. The script first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs the encoded PowerShell command. The use of a hidden window and encoded command suggests an attempt to evade detection and analysis. The rest of the code appears to be a decoy setup script for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this code is malicious as it tries to execute hidden, encoded commands that could compromise the system.",
