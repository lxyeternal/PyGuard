      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads covertly. The command is only run if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which may be a persistence or evasion mechanism. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. The hidden PowerShell command could download, execute, or install additional malicious software, compromise the system, or create a backdoor. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly executing potentially harmful PowerShell commands on a Windows system.",
