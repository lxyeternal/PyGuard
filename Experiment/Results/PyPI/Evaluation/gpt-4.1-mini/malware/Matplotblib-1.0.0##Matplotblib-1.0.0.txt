      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that, during installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted Python code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is decrypted with a hardcoded key and executed via exec(). This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malicious code because it hides the actual payload inside an encrypted blob, which is only decrypted and run at install time, making static analysis difficult. The use of exec() on decrypted data can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing the attacker to run any code on the victim's machine during package installation. The obfuscated class name, meaningless metadata, and the encrypted payload strongly indicate an attempt to conceal malicious actions. Without the exact decrypted payload content, the precise actions are unknown, but this pattern is typical for malware or backdoors embedded in Python packages.",
