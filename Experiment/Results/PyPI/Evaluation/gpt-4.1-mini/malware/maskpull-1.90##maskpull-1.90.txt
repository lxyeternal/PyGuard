      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This PowerShell command invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a remote URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0). The execution is done silently without user knowledge or consent. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and run a payload from the internet, potentially compromising the system by installing backdoors, spyware, or other malicious software. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely used to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package.",
