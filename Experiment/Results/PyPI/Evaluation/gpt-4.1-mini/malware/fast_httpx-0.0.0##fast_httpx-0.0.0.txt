      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including base64 and custom decoding functions. It uses eval and dynamic imports to reconstruct and execute hidden payloads. The code appears to decode a large base64-encoded blob, then further processes it with custom decoding and string manipulation functions before executing it. Such obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns are typical of malicious code designed to hide its true intent and evade detection. The exact payload is not directly visible due to obfuscation, but the use of eval on decoded data, dynamic imports, and manipulation of byte strings strongly indicates that the code is intended to execute hidden, potentially harmful operations. This could include unauthorized data access, remote code execution, or other malicious activities. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious.",
