      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command passed as a base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is decoded and executed by PowerShell without user knowledge or consent. The command is only run if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution or detection. The use of hidden execution and encoded commands is a common technique in malware to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions. Although the exact decoded PowerShell command is not directly visible in the code, the presence of such obfuscated and hidden execution strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially to download or execute further payloads or perform system modifications without user awareness.",
