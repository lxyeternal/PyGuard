      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file named 'DigitalPulse.exe' from an external URL (https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe) during the installation process on Windows systems. It then saves this file locally and executes it using the system command 'start'. This behavior is malicious because it silently fetches and runs an external binary without user consent or verification, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, potential system compromise, data theft, or installation of malware. The use of a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions further obscures this behavior, making it harder to detect or debug. Overall, this code acts as a dropper that installs and runs potentially harmful software on the victim's machine.",
