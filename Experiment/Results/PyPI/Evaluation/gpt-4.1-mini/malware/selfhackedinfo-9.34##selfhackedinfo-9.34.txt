      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This PowerShell command invokes a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) under the disguise of a legitimate setup script. The presence of the hidden execution, encoded command, and external download from an untrusted source strongly indicates malicious intent. The purpose is likely to silently download and run malware or unauthorized software on the victim's machine without their knowledge, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further infection.",
