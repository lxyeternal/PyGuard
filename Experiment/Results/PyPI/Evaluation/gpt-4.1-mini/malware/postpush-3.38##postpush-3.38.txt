      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a remote URL (dl.dropbox.com). This behavior is characteristic of malware attempting to stealthily download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent or knowledge. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup script, but the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent, likely to compromise the system by downloading and running unauthorized software.",
