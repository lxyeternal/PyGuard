      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL (hosted on Google Drive) and saves it locally as 'default.exe'. It then attempts to execute this file using subprocess.run with shell=True. This behavior is potentially malicious because it allows the execution of arbitrary code fetched from the internet without any validation or user consent. The downloaded executable could contain malware, ransomware, spyware, or other harmful payloads that can compromise the system's security, steal data, or cause damage. The use of verify=False in the requests.get call disables SSL certificate verification, which further reduces security by making the connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
