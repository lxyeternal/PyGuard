      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains malicious behavior embedded in the custom installation process of a Python package. Specifically, during the installation (triggered by the 'install' command), it collects all environment variables from the user's system and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a remote server hosted at 'https://ea2de72474be.ngrok.app'. Environment variables often contain sensitive information such as API keys, credentials, tokens, and other private data. By exfiltrating these variables without user consent, the code compromises user privacy and security. This behavior is characteristic of a data-leaking backdoor embedded in the package installation process, which can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and further exploitation of the affected system.",
