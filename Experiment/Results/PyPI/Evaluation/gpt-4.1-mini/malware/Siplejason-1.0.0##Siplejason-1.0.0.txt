      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it executes arbitrary code hidden from static analysis. This behavior can be used to run any code on the victim's machine during package installation, potentially downloading further malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The obfuscation of the payload and the conditional execution only on Windows further suggest an attempt to evade detection and target specific environments. Therefore, this code is malicious and poses a security risk.",
