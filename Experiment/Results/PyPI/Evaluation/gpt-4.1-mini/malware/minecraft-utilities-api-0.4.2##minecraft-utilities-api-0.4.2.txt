      "malicious_behavior": "This Python script is malicious. It is designed to stealthily extract sensitive user data from a Windows system, specifically targeting Discord tokens, browser saved passwords, and cookies from multiple browsers (Chrome, Brave, Edge, Opera, OperaGX). It locates browser data files, decrypts encrypted passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI and AES-GCM decryption, and extracts Discord tokens from local storage. The collected data is saved into text files named with the current user's login. After gathering this sensitive information, the script attempts to exfiltrate the data by sending these files to a remote Discord webhook URL and optionally to a Telegram bot if configured. This behavior constitutes credential theft and privacy invasion, potentially allowing attackers to hijack user accounts, impersonate users, or perform unauthorized actions. The script also cleans up by deleting the local files after sending them, indicating an attempt to cover its tracks.",
