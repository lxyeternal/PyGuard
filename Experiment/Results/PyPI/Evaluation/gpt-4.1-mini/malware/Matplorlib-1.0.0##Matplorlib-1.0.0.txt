      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior embedded in the custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is decrypted with a hardcoded key and then executed via exec(). This technique is commonly used to hide malicious payloads from static analysis. The exact payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of encrypted code execution during installation strongly indicates an attempt to run hidden malicious code on the victim's machine. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, data theft, system compromise, or other harmful effects. The package name 'Matplorlib' is a misspelling of a popular library 'matplotlib', which suggests an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate package to trick users into installing it.",
