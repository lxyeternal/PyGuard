      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior. It uses base64 decoding and exec to execute obfuscated code only on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt') and when the 'sdist' argument is not present in sys.argv. The decoded payload performs operations involving file system manipulation, process creation, and possibly downloading or executing additional code. The obfuscation and conditional execution suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent, evade detection, and execute harmful actions such as unauthorized code execution, persistence mechanisms, or data exfiltration. This type of behavior is typical of malware or backdoor code.",
