      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious Roblox cookie grabber. It attempts to stealthily extract the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie from the victim's browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, Chromium) using the 'browser_cookie3' library. This cookie is a sensitive authentication token that can be used to access the victim's Roblox account without their consent. The script then validates the cookie and, if valid, collects detailed information about the Roblox account associated with the cookie, including user ID, RAP (Recent Average Price), friends count, account age, creation date, Robux balance, premium status, and profile links. It also fetches the victim's public IP address. All this information, including the stolen '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie, is sent to a remote Discord webhook controlled by the attacker. This enables the attacker to hijack the victim's Roblox account, potentially leading to unauthorized access, theft of in-game assets, or other malicious activities. The script disguises its activity by printing a dummy message to distract the user. Overall, this code is designed to steal sensitive authentication credentials and personal information for malicious purposes.",
