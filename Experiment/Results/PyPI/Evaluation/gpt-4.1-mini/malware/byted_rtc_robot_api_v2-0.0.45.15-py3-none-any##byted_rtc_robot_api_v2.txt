      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information such as the operating system name and release version, the current working directory, and the hostname of the machine. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL with a domain that appears random and non-legitimate. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration or telemetry gathering without user consent, which can be used for reconnaissance by an attacker to profile the target system. The code does not perform any authorized or benign function and instead leaks potentially sensitive environment details to an unknown remote server, which is a common trait of malicious spyware or backdoor components.",
