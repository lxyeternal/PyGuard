      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor installation scripts that try to run potentially harmful commands or download and execute payloads from the internet. The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' suggests an attempt to avoid repeated execution and possibly connect to a malicious server. The setup() call appears to be a decoy to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package. Overall, this code is malicious as it tries to stealthily execute a hidden PowerShell command that could compromise the system.",
