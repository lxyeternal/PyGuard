      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that, upon installation, collects sensitive information from the target system and sends it to a remote server. Specifically, it attempts to list directory contents of critical system paths such as '/', '/root/', '/home/', and '/root/.ssh/'. The '/root/.ssh/' directory often contains private SSH keys, which are highly sensitive. It also tries to create a file '/root/j0j0.poc', likely as a marker or to test write permissions. The collected directory listings are sent via an HTTP POST request to 'https://j0j0.xyz/lists/{hostname}/{username}/', effectively exfiltrating data without user consent. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, which is malicious and can lead to system compromise, privacy violations, and unauthorized access.",
