      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently download and run a payload from the internet without user consent. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, likely used as a decoy or to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, this code is malicious as it attempts to stealthily download and execute potentially harmful software.",
