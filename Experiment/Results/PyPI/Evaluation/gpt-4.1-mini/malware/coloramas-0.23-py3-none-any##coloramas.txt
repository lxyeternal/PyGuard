      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to stealthily collect sensitive data related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet from the victim's computer. It searches for specific wallet configuration and security files in the user's roaming appdata directory and other common locations (Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It then compresses these files into a ZIP archive. The script gathers the victim's public IP address and country code to include in a message. Finally, it sends both the message and the ZIP archive containing the stolen wallet files to a remote attacker-controlled Telegram bot via Telegram's API. This behavior constitutes data theft and exfiltration of sensitive cryptocurrency wallet information, which can lead to unauthorized access and theft of the victim's cryptocurrency funds. The use of Telegram as a command-and-control channel and the targeting of wallet files clearly indicate malicious intent.",
