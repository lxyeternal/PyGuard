      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor scripts that try to run unauthorized commands or download and execute payloads covertly. The presence of the hidden PowerShell execution, combined with the check for a folder named 'tahg' (likely to avoid repeated execution), indicates an attempt to persist or perform malicious actions on the system. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the script as a legitimate package, but the primary malicious behavior is the hidden PowerShell command execution which can compromise system security.",
