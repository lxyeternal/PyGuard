      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor scripts that try to download or execute additional payloads from a remote server (in this case, the URL hinted by the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the encoded command). The use of a hidden window and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and hide malicious activity. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup script, likely used as a decoy or to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at executing hidden remote commands on the victim's machine, which can lead to unauthorized control, data theft, or further infection.",
