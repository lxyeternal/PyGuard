      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the standard installation command of a Python package to execute a custom function during installation. Specifically, in the 'run' method of the CustomCommand class, it imports a 'main' function from a module named 'testjsonn1' and calls it with a URL pointing to a Python script hosted on Discord's CDN and a filename 'testnp.py'. This suggests that during installation, the package attempts to download and possibly execute or save a remote script from an external source without user consent. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious code as it can lead to arbitrary code execution, unauthorized data access, or system compromise. The use of an external URL to fetch code dynamically during installation is a common vector for malware distribution.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a specified URL and then executes it using 'pythonw', which runs the script without opening a console window. This behavior can be exploited to silently download and run arbitrary Python code from the internet, potentially leading to unauthorized code execution on the user's system. Such functionality is commonly used in malware to fetch and run payloads without user awareness, posing significant security risks including data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation.",
