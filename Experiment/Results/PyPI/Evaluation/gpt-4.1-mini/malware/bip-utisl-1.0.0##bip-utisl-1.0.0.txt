      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior embedded in the custom installation command class 'GruppeInstall'. During installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is decrypted and executed via 'exec', which is a common technique to hide malicious code from static analysis. This behavior indicates that the package attempts to run hidden code during installation, which can perform unauthorized actions such as downloading additional malware, executing harmful commands, or compromising the system. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as legitimate packages do not typically decrypt and execute hidden code during installation.",
