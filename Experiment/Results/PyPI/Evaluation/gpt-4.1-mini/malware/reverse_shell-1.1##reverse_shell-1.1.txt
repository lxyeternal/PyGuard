      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by sending a notification to a Discord webhook whenever the package is installed, effectively alerting a third party that someone has installed the package named 'reverse_shell'. Additionally, it clones a GitHub repository ('https://github.com/NotInfected/updater.git') into a local directory and executes a Python script ('bypass.py') from that repository. This behavior can be used to silently download and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without their consent, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise. The use of a Discord webhook for notification and the execution of external code strongly indicate that this package is designed to perform covert and potentially harmful actions.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by silently cloning a remote GitHub repository to a local directory and executing a Python script ('bypass.py') from that repository without user consent or awareness. Additionally, it sends a notification to a Discord webhook URL indicating that the package 'reverse_shell' has been installed. The webhook URL is hardcoded and leaks information to an external server controlled by the attacker. The combination of these actions suggests the code is designed to execute potentially harmful or unauthorized code from the remote repository and report back to the attacker, which can lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
