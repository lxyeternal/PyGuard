      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the author email 'tahgoficial@proton.me' suggest a suspicious source. The PowerShell command appears to invoke a web request to 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0' and then execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe'. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and executes a remote payload, potentially compromising the system by running unauthorized or harmful software. The use of hidden window style and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and user awareness. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at silently downloading and executing a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine.",
