      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor scripts that try to run unauthorized commands or download and execute additional payloads. The presence of a check for a folder named 'tahg' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' suggests an attempt to evade repeated execution or detection. The use of subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW and shell=False further indicates an attempt to hide the execution window and avoid detection. Overall, this code is malicious as it runs hidden PowerShell commands that could compromise the system, download malware, or perform other harmful actions without user consent.",
