      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or download and run additional malicious code without detection. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The rest of the code is a seemingly benign Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a legitimate-looking package installation script. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of potentially harmful PowerShell commands, indicating malicious intent.",
