      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is suspicious and typical of malware or backdoor installation attempts. The script first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs the encoded PowerShell command. The presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly indicate malicious intent. The PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further malicious payloads or establishes persistence on the system. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious activity. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute potentially harmful commands on a Windows system, making it malicious.",
