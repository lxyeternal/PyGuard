      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is suspicious and typical of malware or backdoor activity, as it tries to run a hidden process that likely downloads or executes further malicious payloads. The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' before running the command suggests it tries to avoid repeated execution. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute potentially harmful commands on a Windows system, which constitutes malicious behavior.",
