      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to stealthily collect sensitive information from the host machine and exfiltrate it to a remote server. Specifically, it gathers the current Python call stack, environment variable keys, system information (via os.uname()), and the public IP address of the machine by querying 'https://ipinfo.io/ip'. This data is then encoded as JSON and sent via an HTTP POST request to a remote URL that is base64-encoded within the script (which decodes to a suspicious external domain 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/...'). The code includes checks to avoid running on certain known bot hostnames and filenames, indicating an attempt to evade analysis or detection. Finally, it forcibly terminates the program with exit(1), which may disrupt normal operation. This behavior is characteristic of spyware or reconnaissance malware designed to gather and leak system information without user consent.",
