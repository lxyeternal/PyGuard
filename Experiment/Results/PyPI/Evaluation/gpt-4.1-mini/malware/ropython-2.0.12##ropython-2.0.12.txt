      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains a commented-out base64-encoded payload that, when decoded and executed, performs the following malicious actions:\n\n1. It imports the 'requests' and 'os' modules and fetches a remote payload from 'https://pastebin.com/raw/hEF5HaFc'.\n2. It sends an HTTP GET request to this URL with headers mimicking a browser user-agent.\n3. It reads the response content, which is expected to be base64-encoded executable code.\n4. It writes this decoded content to a file named 'pkg_installer.exe'.\n5. It executes this file using the system command.\n6. It then attempts to delete the 'pkg_installer.exe' file.\n\nThis behavior is typical of a downloader or dropper malware that fetches and runs a potentially harmful executable from a remote server. The executable could perform any number of malicious actions, such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or compromising the system. The use of base64 encoding and remote fetching is a common obfuscation and delivery technique to evade detection.\n\nTherefore, despite the malicious payload being commented out, the code clearly contains malicious behavior intended to download and execute a harmful executable on the victim's machine.",
