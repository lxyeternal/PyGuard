      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0). This behavior is characteristic of malware attempting to stealthily download and run a potentially harmful executable from the internet without user consent. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script.",
