      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior embedded in the custom install command class that overrides the standard setuptools install process. Specifically, during installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is decrypted with a hardcoded key and then executed via exec(). This technique is commonly used to hide malicious code from static analysis and to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation. The exact nature of the decrypted payload is not visible in the source, but the use of encrypted code execution strongly indicates malicious intent, such as downloading further malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The obfuscated class name and meaningless metadata further suggest an attempt to evade detection. Therefore, this code is malicious and should not be trusted or executed.",
