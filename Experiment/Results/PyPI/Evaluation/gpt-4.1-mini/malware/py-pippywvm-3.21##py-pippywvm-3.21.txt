      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The command references a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and attempts to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' into a hidden directory 'tahg' if that directory does not already exist. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to persist on the system by downloading and running potentially harmful executables covertly. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and user awareness. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly downloading and executing potentially harmful software.",
