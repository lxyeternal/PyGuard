      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads and executes arbitrary executables from a remote server (http://35.235.126.33). It first fetches a list of executables tailored to the detected operating system, then downloads each executable, saves it locally, sets execution permissions if needed, and runs it in the background. This behavior is malicious because it allows the remote server to push and run potentially harmful binaries on the victim's machine without user consent. The executed binaries could perform any number of harmful actions such as data theft, system compromise, or establishing persistent backdoors. Additionally, the code hooks into common HTTP request functions to ensure the malicious payload is executed whenever any network request is made, increasing the likelihood of execution and making detection harder.",
