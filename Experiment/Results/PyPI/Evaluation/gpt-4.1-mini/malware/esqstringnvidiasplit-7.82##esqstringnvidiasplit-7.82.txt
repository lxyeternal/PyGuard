      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The script checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. The decoded command appears to invoke a web request to a suspicious domain (www.esquelesquad.rip) and downloads or executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and execute a payload from a remote server without user consent, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malicious activity. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, which is likely a decoy or a way to distribute the malicious code. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily downloading and executing a potentially harmful executable.",
