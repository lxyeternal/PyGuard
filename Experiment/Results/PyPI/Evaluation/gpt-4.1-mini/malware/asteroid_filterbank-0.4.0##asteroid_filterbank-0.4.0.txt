      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class 'new_install' that registers a function '_post_install' to be executed at program exit (via atexit). The '_post_install' function performs several suspicious actions: it creates/appends a file named 'bykotko.txt' with the content 'kotko' (likely a marker or flag), then it retrieves the public IP address of the machine by querying 'https://api.ipify.org'. It also collects the hostname of the machine and the absolute path of the current script's directory. These three pieces of information (IP, hostname, and path) are concatenated, base64-encoded, and sent as a GET request parameter to an external URL 'https://kotko.org' with a query string constructed from package-related strings and the encoded data. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment information without user consent. Such actions are typical of malicious code aiming to fingerprint or track infected machines, possibly for further exploitation or unauthorized data collection. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior.",
