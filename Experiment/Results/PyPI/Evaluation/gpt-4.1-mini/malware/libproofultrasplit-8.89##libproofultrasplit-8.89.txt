      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from the URL 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0'. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to stealthily download and run a potentially harmful executable from the internet without user consent. The use of a hidden window and encoded command is intended to evade detection. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to facilitate installation. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at downloading and executing a remote payload, which can compromise the system.",
