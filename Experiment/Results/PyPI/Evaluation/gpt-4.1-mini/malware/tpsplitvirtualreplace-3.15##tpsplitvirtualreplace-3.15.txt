      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or connect to remote servers covertly. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the use of a suspicious folder name 'tahg' further suggest malicious intent. The PowerShell command likely downloads or executes additional malicious code from a remote source (the encoded command references a URL 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm...'), which can compromise the system, steal data, or install further malware. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of potentially harmful remote code, making it malicious.",
