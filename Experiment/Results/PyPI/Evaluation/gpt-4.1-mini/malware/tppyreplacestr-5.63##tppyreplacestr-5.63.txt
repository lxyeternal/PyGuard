      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This PowerShell command invokes a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) under the disguise of a legitimate setup script. The presence of the hidden execution, encoded command, and external download from an untrusted source strongly indicates malicious intent. The downloaded payload could potentially be malware, spyware, or any other harmful software, posing a security risk to the system where this script is run.",
