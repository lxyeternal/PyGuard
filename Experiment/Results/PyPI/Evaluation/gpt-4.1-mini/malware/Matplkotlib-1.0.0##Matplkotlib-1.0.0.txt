      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is malicious. It defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. This behavior is indicative of an attempt to hide malicious code execution during installation, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. The exact payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of encrypted code execution during install strongly suggests that the package performs unauthorized or harmful actions on the victim's machine. This could include downloading additional malware, stealing data, or compromising system integrity. The package name 'Matplkotlib' is a misspelling of the legitimate 'matplotlib' package, which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages.",
