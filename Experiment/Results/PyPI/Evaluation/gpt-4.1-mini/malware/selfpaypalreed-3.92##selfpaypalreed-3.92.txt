      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The command references a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and attempts to download or execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and execute additional payloads or backdoors on the victim's machine without consent. The use of a hidden window and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and hide malicious activity. The rest of the code is a setup script that appears benign but is likely a cover or part of a malicious package. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily executing a potentially harmful payload on a Windows system.",
