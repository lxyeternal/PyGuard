      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. The presence of the check for a directory named 'tahg' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' suggests an attempt to avoid repeated execution or detection. The PowerShell command likely downloads or executes additional payloads from a remote source (as indicated by the URL-like string in the encoded command). This behavior is typical of malware that tries to establish persistence or download further malicious components. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, which is a common tactic to disguise malicious activity. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of potentially harmful remote code, making it malicious.",
