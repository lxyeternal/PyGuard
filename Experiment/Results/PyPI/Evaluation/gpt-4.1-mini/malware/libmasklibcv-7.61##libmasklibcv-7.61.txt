      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com link with query parameters). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run additional malicious payloads silently on the victim's machine. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. The presence of hidden execution of external code from an untrusted source, especially with obfuscation (encoded command), is a clear indicator of malicious intent.",
