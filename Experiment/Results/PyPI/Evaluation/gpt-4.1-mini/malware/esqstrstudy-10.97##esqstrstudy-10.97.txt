      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The script checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden command. The decoded Base64 string corresponds to a PowerShell invocation that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0). This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and run a payload from the internet without user consent, potentially compromising the system. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily downloading and executing a potentially harmful executable.",
