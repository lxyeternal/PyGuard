      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command (GruppeInstall) that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using a Fernet symmetric encryption key. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted at runtime, which is a common technique used to hide malicious code from static analysis. Executing decrypted code during installation is suspicious and indicates that the package attempts to run hidden code on the user's machine without explicit consent. This behavior can be used to download additional malware, steal information, or perform other harmful actions. The use of encrypted payload and execution during install strongly suggests malicious intent.",
