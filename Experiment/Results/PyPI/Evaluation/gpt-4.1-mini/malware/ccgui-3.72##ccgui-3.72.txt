      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command passed as a base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This PowerShell command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded command decodes to a PowerShell invocation that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a remote URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as '~\\WindowsCache.exe'. This behavior is characteristic of malware that tries to stealthily download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent or knowledge. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly downloading and executing a remote payload, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or other harmful effects.",
