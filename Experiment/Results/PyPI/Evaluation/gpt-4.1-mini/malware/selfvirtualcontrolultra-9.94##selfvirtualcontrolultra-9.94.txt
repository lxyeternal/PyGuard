      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) related to 'dl.dropbox.com'. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and run additional malicious payloads on the victim's machine without user consent. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and analysis. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, which appears benign but is likely a decoy or a way to distribute the malicious code. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly downloading and executing potentially harmful software.",
