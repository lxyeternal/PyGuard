      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that, upon installation, collects sensitive information from the victim's environment, including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain (fo7288ar9hjgo6tp8p6c1efxpovgja7z.oastify.com). This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration and reconnaissance, which can be used for further attacks or unauthorized data collection. Embedding such network calls in a package's installation process is a common tactic in malicious packages to stealthily gather information about the infected system without user consent.",
