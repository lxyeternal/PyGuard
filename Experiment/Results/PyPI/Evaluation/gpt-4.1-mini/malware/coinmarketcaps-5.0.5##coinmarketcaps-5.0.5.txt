      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs malicious actions during the installation process of the package. Specifically, it sends a GET request to an external URL (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php) with the environment variable COMPUTERNAME appended, potentially leaking the victim's computer name to a remote server. Furthermore, if the platform is Windows ('win32'), it downloads an executable file from https://python-release.com/python-install.scr, saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe', and executes it using the system command 'start'. This behavior indicates that the code is attempting to silently download and run potentially harmful software on the victim's machine without their consent, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware infection.",
