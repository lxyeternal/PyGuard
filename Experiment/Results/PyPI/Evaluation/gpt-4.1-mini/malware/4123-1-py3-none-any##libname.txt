      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious Discord token stealer. It searches for Discord authentication tokens stored locally on the victim's machine by scanning specific directories related to Discord and various browsers. It uses regex patterns to extract tokens from local storage files. The script also attempts to kill the 'Fiddler.exe' process, which is a debugging proxy tool often used to inspect network traffic, likely to prevent the victim from detecting or analyzing the malicious activity. After collecting tokens, it sends them along with the victim's IP address, PC username, and platform information to a remote Discord webhook URL controlled by the attacker. This allows the attacker to hijack the victim's Discord accounts, potentially leading to account theft, unauthorized access, and further malicious actions. The code operates stealthily by suppressing exceptions during the webhook request and running the process-killing function in a separate thread.",
