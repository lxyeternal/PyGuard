      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor code that tries to run potentially harmful or unauthorized commands on the victim's machine. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs the hidden PowerShell command. The presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands strongly indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute potentially harmful commands on Windows systems, which can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise.",
