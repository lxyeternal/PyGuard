      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation command class for a Python package setup script. During installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows execution of arbitrary code hidden from static analysis. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to hide their true functionality until runtime. The code does not reveal what the decrypted payload does, but the pattern strongly suggests it is executing hidden malicious code, potentially to download further payloads, steal data, or compromise the system. The obfuscation of class names and meaningless metadata further supports the suspicion of malicious intent.",
