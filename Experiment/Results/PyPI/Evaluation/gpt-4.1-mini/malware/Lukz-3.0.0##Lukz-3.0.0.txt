      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and encryption to conceal its true functionality. It imports modules such as base64, marshal, zlib, and cryptography.fernet, and defines a lambda function to decompress and deserialize data. The code contains a large base64-encoded string (__mikey__) used as a key for Fernet symmetric encryption, and another large hex-encoded string (mydata) which is decrypted and decoded through several steps. Eventually, the code executes dynamically generated code via exec after multiple decoding and decryption steps. This kind of obfuscation and dynamic execution is a common technique used in malicious scripts to hide payloads, evade detection, and execute arbitrary code. The code likely downloads, decrypts, or executes hidden malicious payloads, which can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise. Due to the complexity and obfuscation, the exact payload cannot be determined without full decryption, but the structure and techniques strongly indicate malicious intent.",
