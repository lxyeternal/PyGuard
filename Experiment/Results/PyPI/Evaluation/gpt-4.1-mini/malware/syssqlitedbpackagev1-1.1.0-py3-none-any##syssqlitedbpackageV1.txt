      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits clear malicious behavior. It first attempts to install a package named 'fernet' via pip, which is suspicious because the standard cryptography package providing Fernet is 'cryptography', not 'fernet'. Then, it imports Fernet from this package and uses it to decrypt a large, base64-encoded encrypted payload. The decrypted payload is then executed dynamically using exec(). This technique is a classic example of code obfuscation and concealment used by malware to hide its true functionality and evade detection. The actual malicious payload is hidden inside the encrypted data, making static analysis difficult. Executing such hidden code can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially compromising the system by installing backdoors, stealing data, or performing other harmful actions. Therefore, this code is malicious and should be treated with caution.",
