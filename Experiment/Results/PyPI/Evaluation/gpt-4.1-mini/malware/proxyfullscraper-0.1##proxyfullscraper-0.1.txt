      "malicious_behavior": "The code scans the file system starting from specific directories ('/storage/emulated/0' and '/sdcard/DCIM'), searching for files with extensions .py, .php, .zip, and image files (.png, .jpg, .jpeg). It then sends these files and their metadata (file name and path) to a remote Telegram chat using a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. This behavior effectively exfiltrates potentially sensitive files and images from the device to an external party without user consent. The use of Telegram's bot API to silently upload documents and photos indicates an intent to steal data covertly. Such unauthorized data exfiltration is a clear malicious activity, potentially leading to privacy breaches, data theft, and further exploitation.",
