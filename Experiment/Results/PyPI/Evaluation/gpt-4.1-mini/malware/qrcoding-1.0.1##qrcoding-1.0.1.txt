      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the standard installation process of a Python package by defining a custom install command. During installation, it downloads a Python script ('qrcodes.py') from an external URL (https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py) without any verification or user consent, saves it locally, and immediately executes it using the current Python interpreter. This behavior is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous because it allows arbitrary code execution from an untrusted remote source during package installation. The downloaded script could perform any malicious actions such as stealing data, installing backdoors, or compromising the system. This technique is a common vector for supply chain attacks and is considered malicious.",
