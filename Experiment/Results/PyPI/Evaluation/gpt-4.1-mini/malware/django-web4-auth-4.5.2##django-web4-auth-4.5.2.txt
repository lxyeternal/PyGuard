      "malicious_behavior": "This code performs unauthorized network communication and downloads and executes a potentially harmful executable file. Specifically, during the installation process (hooked via a custom install command), it sends a GET request to an external URL (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php) with the local computer's name as a parameter, which leaks environment information to a remote server. Then, if the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable file from https://python-release.com/python-install.scr, saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and executes it using the system command 'start'. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to silently download and run malicious payloads on the victim's machine during package installation, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malware infection.",
