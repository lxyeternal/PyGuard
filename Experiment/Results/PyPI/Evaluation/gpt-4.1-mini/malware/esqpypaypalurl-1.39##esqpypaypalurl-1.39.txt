      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as '~\\WindowsCache.exe'. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently download and run a payload without user consent or knowledge. The presence of the hidden window style and the use of encoded commands are common techniques to evade detection. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, this code is malicious as it tries to stealthily download and execute an external executable, potentially compromising the system.",
