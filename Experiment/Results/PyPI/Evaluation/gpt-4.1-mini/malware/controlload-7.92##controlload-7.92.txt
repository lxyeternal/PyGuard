      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads covertly. The command is only run if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution or detection. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly legitimate package installation script. The hidden PowerShell command could download or execute further malicious code, compromise the system, or establish persistence. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly executing potentially harmful PowerShell commands on a Windows system.",
