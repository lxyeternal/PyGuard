      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a sophisticated malware designed to steal sensitive user information from a Windows PC. It performs multiple malicious actions including:\n\n1. **Credential Theft:** It extracts saved passwords, cookies, credit card information, and browsing history from various browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, Firefox, etc.) by accessing their local databases, decrypting encrypted data using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption with master keys.\n\n2. **Discord Token Stealing:** It searches for Discord tokens stored in local storage of Discord and other Chromium-based apps, decrypts them, validates them via Discord API, and collects user information such as username, badges, email, phone, Nitro subscription, and billing info.\n\n3. **System Information Gathering:** It collects detailed system information including PC username, computer name, Windows version, Windows product key, hardware UUID, RAM, disk size, IP address, geolocation, and network info.\n\n4. **Clipboard Hijacking:** It monitors the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet addresses and replaces them with attacker-controlled addresses to hijack cryptocurrency transactions.\n\n5. **Persistence:** It attempts to copy itself to the Windows startup folder to run on system boot.\n\n6. **Anti-Debugging and Anti-VM:** It checks for known virtual machine artifacts, debugger processes, suspicious usernames, hardware IDs, and IP addresses to avoid running in analysis environments.\n\n7. **Data Exfiltration:** It compresses stolen data into zip files and uploads them to a remote server via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded webhook URL (https://kekwltd.ru/relay/bluescreen), which is likely controlled by the attacker.\n\n8. **Process Killing:** Optionally kills Discord and related processes to avoid detection or interference.\n\n9. **Additional Data Theft:** It steals Minecraft and Roblox data, including Roblox cookies.\n\n10. **File Searching and Uploading:** It searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files with keywords related to passwords, wallets, tokens, and uploads them to the attacker's server.\n\nOverall, this code is a fully featured information stealer (stealer malware) targeting Windows users, designed to harvest credentials, tokens, financial data, and system info, then exfiltrate it to an attacker-controlled server. Its purpose is to compromise user accounts, steal cryptocurrency, and gain unauthorized access to victim systems and services.",
