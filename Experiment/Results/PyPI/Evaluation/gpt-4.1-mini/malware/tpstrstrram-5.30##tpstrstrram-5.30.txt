      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that try to run unauthorized commands or download and execute additional payloads. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate Python package setup script, likely used as a decoy or to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of potentially harmful commands and is therefore malicious.",
