      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a sophisticated malicious software (malware) designed to steal sensitive user information from a Windows PC. It performs multiple harmful actions including:\n\n1. **Credential Theft:** It extracts saved passwords, cookies, credit card information, and browsing history from various browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, Firefox, etc.) by accessing browser data files, decrypting encrypted credentials using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption.\n\n2. **Discord Token Stealing:** It searches for Discord tokens stored in local storage of Discord and other Chromium-based apps, validates them by querying Discord API, and collects user information.\n\n3. **System Information Gathering:** It collects detailed system information such as Windows product key, version, hardware UUID, RAM, disk size, IP address, geolocation, and more.\n\n4. **Clipboard Hijacking for Cryptocurrency Addresses:** It monitors the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet addresses and replaces them with attacker-controlled addresses to hijack cryptocurrency transactions.\n\n5. **Persistence Mechanism:** It copies itself to the Windows startup folder to run on system boot.\n\n6. **Anti-Debugging and Anti-VM Checks:** It attempts to detect if it is running in a virtual machine or debugging environment and exits if detected.\n\n7. **Process Killing:** It can kill processes related to Discord and debugging tools to avoid detection.\n\n8. **Data Exfiltration:** It compresses stolen data into zip files and uploads them to attacker-controlled Discord webhooks and other remote servers (e.g., prepaidroot.ru). It also uploads files to anonymous file sharing services.\n\n9. **Spreading and Covering Tracks:** It modifies BetterDiscord files to remove or replace webhook URLs to evade detection.\n\nOverall, this code is a fully featured information stealer and credential harvester malware targeting Windows users, with a focus on stealing browser data, Discord tokens, and cryptocurrency wallets, and exfiltrating this data to attacker-controlled endpoints. Its presence on a system poses a severe security and privacy risk.",
