      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. The script is triggered only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution. The decoded command appears to invoke a web request to 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0' and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then executes it. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and runs a payload from a remote server, potentially compromising the system by executing arbitrary code. The presence of a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of hidden PowerShell execution further indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. Overall, this code is malicious as it downloads and executes an external executable without user consent, which can lead to system compromise.",
