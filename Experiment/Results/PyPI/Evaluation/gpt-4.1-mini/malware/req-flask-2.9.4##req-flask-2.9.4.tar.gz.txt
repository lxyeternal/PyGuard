      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It first checks for the existence of a file named 'hifromDreamyOak' and exits if it exists, likely as a persistence or anti-analysis mechanism. Then, it decodes and executes a base64-encoded payload. This payload imports the 'requests' module, fetches a Windows executable file from a Discord CDN URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/accounts/1109465188433936425/Windows.exe), saves it to a temporary file, and executes it using subprocess.call. This behavior indicates that the script downloads and runs a potentially harmful executable from an external source without user consent, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or malware infection. The initial setuptools setup call appears to be a decoy or an attempt to disguise the script as a legitimate package.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL (hosted on Discord's CDN) and saves it to a temporary file on the local system. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using subprocess.call. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malware or malicious scripts that attempt to fetch and run potentially harmful executables without user consent or verification. The downloaded executable could perform any number of harmful actions, such as installing malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. Since the code executes an unverified binary from an external source, it poses a significant security risk.",
