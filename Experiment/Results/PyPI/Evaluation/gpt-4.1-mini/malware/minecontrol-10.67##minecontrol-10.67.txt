      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The script checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs this hidden PowerShell command. This behavior is suspicious and typical of malware trying to execute payloads or download and run additional malicious code without user consent. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and hide malicious activity. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call, which appears benign, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent.",
