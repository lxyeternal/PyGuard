      "malicious_behavior": "This code attempts to stealthily inject a malicious Chrome extension into the user's browser by modifying shortcuts to popular browsers (chrome.exe, msedge.exe, launcher.exe, brave.exe) on the Windows system. It creates a hidden folder under the user's APPDATA directory named 'Extension' and writes obfuscated JavaScript code (background.js) and a manifest.json file that requests clipboard read/write permissions. The JavaScript code repeatedly runs a function that manipulates clipboard content, replacing certain cryptocurrency wallet addresses with attacker-controlled addresses, effectively hijacking clipboard data to steal or redirect cryptocurrency transactions. The script modifies browser shortcuts in common locations such as the Start Menu, Taskbar pinned items, and Desktop to load this malicious extension on browser startup. This behavior is typical of clipboard hijackers targeting cryptocurrency users, aiming to intercept and redirect funds without the user's knowledge. The code also attempts to install the 'pypiwin32' package if missing, to enable Windows COM automation for shortcut manipulation. Overall, this is a malicious backdoor that compromises browser security and user funds by injecting unauthorized extensions and hijacking clipboard data.",
