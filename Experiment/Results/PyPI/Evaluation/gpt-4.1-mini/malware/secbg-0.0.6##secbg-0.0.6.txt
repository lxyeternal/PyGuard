      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to import and execute code from a package named 'secrevtwo' by running subprocesses that execute Python commands importing 'secrevtwo' and its 'dist_util' module. The 'secrevtwo' package is not a standard or well-known package and is listed as a dependency in the setup script, which suggests it will be installed alongside this package. The subprocess calls are designed to run silently (with warnings ignored and no output handling), which is suspicious behavior often used to execute hidden or unauthorized code. This pattern is commonly used to run malicious payloads or backdoors embedded in the 'secrevtwo' package or its modules. The code does not perform any legitimate or transparent action and instead tries to execute potentially harmful code in a stealthy manner. Therefore, this code is malicious as it attempts to execute hidden code from an unknown package, which could lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
