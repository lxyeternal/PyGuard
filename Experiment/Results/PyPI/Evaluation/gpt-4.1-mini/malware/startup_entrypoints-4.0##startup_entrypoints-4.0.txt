      "malicious_behavior": "This code modifies the installation process of a Python package by registering a function (_post_install) to run at program exit during the install command. The _post_install function encodes the machine's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in base64 and appends it as a query parameter to a URL pointing to a remote server (hosted on Heroku). It then downloads a file named 'image.png' from that URL and saves it locally in the same directory as the script. This behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious because it silently contacts an external server during installation, sending identifiable information about the host machine, and downloads a file without user consent or verification. The downloaded file could contain malicious payloads or be used for further exploitation. The use of a seemingly innocuous filename ('image.png') to disguise the downloaded content adds to the suspicion. Overall, this code exhibits characteristics of malware or spyware by performing covert network communication and file download during package installation.",
