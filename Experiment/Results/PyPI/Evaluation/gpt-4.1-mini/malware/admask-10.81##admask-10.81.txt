      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command passed as a base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command runs a PowerShell invocation that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com). The code first checks if a directory or file named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it triggers this hidden download and execution. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and run a payload without user consent, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malicious activity. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate.",
