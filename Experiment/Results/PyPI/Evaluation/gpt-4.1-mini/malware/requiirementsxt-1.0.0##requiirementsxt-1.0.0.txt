      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is malicious. It defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install behavior when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted at runtime, which is a common technique to hide malicious code from static analysis. Executing decrypted code dynamically via exec() is highly suspicious and typically used to run hidden or harmful operations. The exact decrypted payload is not visible in the source, but the use of encrypted code execution during installation strongly indicates malicious intent, such as downloading additional malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The package name and metadata appear obfuscated or random, further suggesting an attempt to disguise the package's true purpose.",
