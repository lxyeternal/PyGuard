      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains a large obfuscated string assigned to a variable with a suspicious name pattern '__kys_skid__...'. This string is constructed using hexadecimal escape sequences and is extremely long and unreadable. At the end of the code, there is an 'exec' statement that executes a complex decoding and decompression pipeline on a base64-encoded, base16-decoded, base32-decoded, base85-decoded, lzma-decompressed, and zlib-decompressed marshaled Python bytecode object. This means the code dynamically loads and executes hidden bytecode that is not visible in the source. Such obfuscation and dynamic execution are common techniques used in malicious code to hide its true functionality and evade detection. The setup() call appears benign and is likely a decoy or part of a packaging process to disguise the malicious payload. Without fully decoding and analyzing the embedded bytecode, the obfuscation and execution pattern strongly indicate malicious intent, potentially executing harmful or unauthorized actions when run.",
