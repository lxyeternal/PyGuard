      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe). This behavior is typical of malware that tries to silently download and run a payload without user consent. The presence of a hidden window style and the use of encoded commands are common techniques to evade detection. The downloaded executable could be any form of malware, such as a miner, backdoor, or trojan, potentially compromising the system's security and privacy. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, likely to disguise the malicious intent.",
