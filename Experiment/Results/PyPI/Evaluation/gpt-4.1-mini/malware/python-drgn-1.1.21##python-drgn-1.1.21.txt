It then sends all this information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, potentially leaking private and sensitive information to an external party. Such unauthorized data collection and transmission is considered malicious as it compromises user privacy and security.",
