      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The script is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution. The PowerShell command references a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and downloads or executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in a hidden manner. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and run a payload covertly, potentially compromising the system by executing unauthorized code, possibly for persistence, data theft, or further infection. The rest of the code is a setup script that appears legitimate but is likely a disguise to hide the malicious payload execution.",
