      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, username, the current working directory, and a package identifier, then encodes this data in base64 and further encodes it as hexadecimal strings. It then sends this encoded information covertly by issuing multiple 'ping' commands to dynamically constructed subdomains under '.sub.deliverycontent.online', effectively exfiltrating data via DNS queries. Additionally, it attempts to send the same data via HTTP POST and GET requests to 'www.deliverycontent.online' using multiple methods (urllib.request, requests, and urllib), increasing the chance of successful data transmission. This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration malware or spyware, as it stealthily leaks potentially sensitive environment information to an external server without user consent. The use of multiple fallback methods and encoding techniques suggests an attempt to evade detection and ensure data delivery. Therefore, this code is malicious and poses a privacy and security risk.",
