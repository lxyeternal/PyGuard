      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains explicitly malicious behavior. It defines a function damage_system() that attempts to delete all files in the Windows System32 directory using the command 'del C:\\Windows\\System32\\*.*'. This directory is critical for the Windows operating system, and deleting its contents would render the system inoperable, causing severe damage. Additionally, the code runs an executable 'kitty.exe' from a package resource, which could potentially be harmful depending on the executable's content, but the main confirmed malicious action is the destructive deletion of system files. The script also opens a YouTube URL in a separate thread, which is benign but could be a distraction or social engineering tactic. The script's argument parser includes a '--kill-system' flag that triggers the destructive deletion, warning users not to use it unless they know what they are doing. Overall, the presence of code that attempts to delete critical system files classifies this script as malicious.",
