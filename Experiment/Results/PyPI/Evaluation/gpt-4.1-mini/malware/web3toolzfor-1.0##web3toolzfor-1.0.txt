      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects Steam client session data from the victim's computer, specifically targeting files starting with 'ssfn' in the Steam installation directory and the Steam 'config' folder. It compresses these files into a zip archive and uploads them to a remote server via an HTTP POST request to a URL decoded from base64. This behavior is indicative of credential or session token theft, allowing an attacker to potentially hijack the victim's Steam account. The code operates stealthily by deleting the zip file after upload to cover its tracks. Such actions constitute malicious behavior as they compromise user privacy and security.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to copy the entire contents of the user's Exodus wallet data directory from the AppData\\Roaming\\Exodus folder to a temporary location, compresses it into a zip archive, and then uploads this archive to a remote server via an HTTP POST request. The URL of the remote server is base64-encoded in the script and decoded at runtime. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, specifically targeting cryptocurrency wallet data, which can lead to theft of sensitive information such as private keys and wallet credentials. The code also attempts to clean up the temporary files after uploading. Overall, this script is designed to stealthily steal sensitive user data and send it to an attacker-controlled server, which is malicious behavior.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports and executes functions from modules with suspicious names such as 'metamask', 'discord', 'exodus', 'machine', 'screenshot', and 'telegram', which are commonly associated with cryptocurrency wallets, messaging platforms, and system information. The functions called include 'yea()', 'find_tokens()', 'runner()', 'machineinfo()', 'sikrinsat()', and 'telegram()'. The naming and context strongly suggest that these functions are designed to steal sensitive information such as cryptocurrency wallet data (e.g., MetaMask, Exodus), Discord tokens, system information, and possibly take screenshots. The import of a module named 'web3toolzfor.passwords_cards_cookies' further indicates an attempt to access passwords, credit card data, and cookies. The code runs these functions inside try-except blocks to avoid crashing on errors, and it launches the main function 'stha' in a separate thread, which is a common technique to run malicious payloads stealthily. Overall, this code appears to be part of a malware or stealer designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data related to cryptocurrency wallets, Discord tokens, system info, and possibly screenshots, posing a significant privacy and security risk.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to steal Discord authentication tokens from a victim's computer. It searches through various local application data directories associated with Discord and multiple web browsers to find files that may contain Discord tokens. It uses regular expressions to extract tokens from these files. The extracted tokens are then sent to a remote Discord webhook URL (decoded from base64) via an HTTP POST request. This behavior allows an attacker to hijack Discord accounts by obtaining their authentication tokens without the user's consent, which is a serious security and privacy violation.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily collect data from specific directories related to browser extensions, particularly those associated with cryptocurrency wallets (e.g., MetaMask). It targets local extension settings folders for browsers like Microsoft Edge, Brave, Google Chrome, and Opera GX, copying these directories to a temporary location. It then compresses the copied data into a ZIP archive and uploads this archive to a remote server via an HTTP POST request. The remote server URL is base64-encoded in the script, which is a common obfuscation technique to hide the destination. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of potentially sensitive information such as wallet credentials or private keys stored by these browser extensions. Such actions constitute malicious behavior as they compromise user privacy and security, potentially leading to theft of cryptocurrency or other sensitive data.",

It then sends this screenshot file via an HTTP POST request to a remote URL (decoded from base64), which appears to be a Discord webhook URL. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration, as it silently captures and uploads potentially sensitive visual information from the user's screen to a remote server without user consent. Such actions can lead to privacy violations, data leaks, and potential further exploitation.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This Python script is malicious. It targets multiple Chromium-based browsers installed on a Windows system, extracting sensitive user data such as saved passwords, cookies, credit card information, browsing history, and download history. It does so by locating browser data directories, decrypting encrypted passwords and credit card numbers using the Windows CryptUnprotectData API and AES decryption with the browser's master key. The collected data is saved into text files in a temporary directory, then compressed into a ZIP archive. Finally, the script exfiltrates this archive by uploading it to a remote server via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL.

It then sends this information as a JSON payload to a remote Discord webhook URL (decoded from base64). This behavior is characteristic of an information stealer or reconnaissance malware, as it silently gathers sensitive system identifiers and network information and exfiltrates it to an attacker-controlled server without user consent. Such data can be used for fingerprinting the victim's machine, tracking, or further targeted attacks. The code does not perform any destructive actions but compromises user privacy and security by leaking system details to a third party.",
