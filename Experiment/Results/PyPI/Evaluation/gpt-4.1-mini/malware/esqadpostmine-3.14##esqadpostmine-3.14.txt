      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command invokes a web request to download and execute a file from an external URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and runs it silently on the victim's machine. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and run a payload without user consent, potentially leading to unauthorized control, data theft, or system compromise. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, likely to evade suspicion.",
