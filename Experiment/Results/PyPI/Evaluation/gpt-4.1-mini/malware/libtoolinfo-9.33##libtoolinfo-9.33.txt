      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user awareness. This command appears to invoke a web request to download or execute a file from an external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and then runs it with hidden window style. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and execute a payload from the internet without user consent, potentially compromising the system. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. The presence of the hidden PowerShell command execution and external payload download clearly indicates malicious intent.",
