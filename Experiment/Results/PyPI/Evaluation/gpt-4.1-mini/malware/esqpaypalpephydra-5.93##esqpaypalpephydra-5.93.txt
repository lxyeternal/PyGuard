      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or connect to remote servers covertly. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the use of a suspicious folder name 'tahg' suggest an attempt to avoid repeated execution by checking if the folder exists. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or a way to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installer, but the primary malicious action is the hidden PowerShell command execution. This can lead to unauthorized code execution, potential system compromise, data exfiltration, or installation of further malware.",
