      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code uses the 'pytransform' module and calls 'pyarmor_runtime()' followed by a call to '__pyarmor__' with a large byte string argument. This pattern is characteristic of code protected or obfuscated by PyArmor, a tool used to encrypt and obfuscate Python scripts to prevent reverse engineering. While PyArmor itself is a legitimate tool, it is often used to hide malicious payloads or unauthorized code. The extremely large encrypted byte string suggests that the actual code logic is hidden and cannot be analyzed directly. Because the code is obfuscated and the real behavior is concealed, it is impossible to verify its safety without decrypting or running it in a controlled environment. This obfuscation is a common technique used by malware authors to evade detection and analysis. Therefore, this code is considered malicious or at least suspicious due to its obfuscated nature and use of runtime decryption, which can hide harmful behavior such as unauthorized data access, backdoors, or other malicious activities.",
