      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including base64 and hex escapes, and dynamic evaluation via eval. It imports built-in functions and modules in a disguised manner, then decodes and executes a large encoded payload. The payload appears to be a binary or encoded data blob that is decoded and then executed as code. Such obfuscation and dynamic execution are common techniques used in malicious scripts to hide their true intent and evade detection. The code likely executes hidden functionality that could include unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Because it uses eval on decoded data and imports modules dynamically, it poses a significant security risk and should be considered malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding and dynamic evaluation. It uses eval with encoded strings, base64 decoding, and string manipulations to hide its true functionality. The code imports modules and functions dynamically, decodes large blocks of encoded data, and executes them at runtime. Such techniques are typical of malicious scripts attempting to evade detection by static analysis tools. The presence of base64 decoding combined with eval and decode calls strongly suggests that the code is designed to execute hidden payloads, which could include downloading malware, executing arbitrary commands, or compromising the host system. The obfuscation and dynamic execution pattern indicate intent to conceal harmful behavior, making this code malicious.",
