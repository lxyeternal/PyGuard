      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The command references a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and attempts to invoke a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' into a hidden directory 'tahg' if that directory does not already exist. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and run a payload from a remote server, potentially compromising the system. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at silently downloading and executing potentially harmful software.",
