      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (GruppeInstall) that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on Windows (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted at runtime with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it executes arbitrary code that is hidden from static analysis. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to hide their true functionality until runtime. The purpose of this code is to stealthily execute hidden code during installation, which can lead to unauthorized actions such as downloading further malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The obfuscation and conditional execution only on Windows further suggest an attempt to evade detection and target specific environments.",
