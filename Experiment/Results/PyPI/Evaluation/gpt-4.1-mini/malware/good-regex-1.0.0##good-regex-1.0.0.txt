      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that, upon installation, collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and the username of the user running the installation. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external server (fo7288ar9hjgo6tp8p6c1efxpovgja7z.oastify.com). This behavior is malicious because it exfiltrates potentially sensitive system information without user consent, which can be used for reconnaissance by attackers to further compromise the system or track users. Embedding such data exfiltration in a package's install process is a common tactic in supply chain attacks.",
