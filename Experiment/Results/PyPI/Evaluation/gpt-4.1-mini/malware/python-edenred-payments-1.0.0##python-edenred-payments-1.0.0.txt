      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that, upon installation, collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and the username of the user running the installation. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL (https://cdf5rwk2vtc0000c78d0ggz1hqeyyyyyb.oast.fun). This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration or reconnaissance, potentially allowing an attacker to gather information about the victim's system without consent. Such actions are considered malicious as they compromise user privacy and security.",
