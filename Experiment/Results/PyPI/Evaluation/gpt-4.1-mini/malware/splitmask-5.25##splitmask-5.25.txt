      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor scripts that try to execute potentially harmful commands or download and run additional payloads without user consent. The use of a hidden window and encoded command is a common technique to evade detection and hide malicious activity. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package, likely used as a decoy or to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at executing hidden PowerShell commands that could compromise the system.",
