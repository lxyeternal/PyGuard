      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains obfuscated and encoded payloads that are decoded and executed at runtime. It uses base64 decoding and exec to run hidden code, which is a common technique to conceal malicious behavior. The code checks the operating system and executes different base64-decoded payloads accordingly. The payloads appear to perform network requests, download and execute additional code, manipulate system files, and potentially establish persistence or backdoor access. The presence of encoded strings, dynamic execution, and system-level operations strongly indicate that this code is designed to perform unauthorized or harmful actions on the host system.",
