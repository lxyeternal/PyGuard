      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is suspicious and typical of malware or backdoor installation attempts. The command references downloading or executing something from a URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0) and then runs a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' with the 'Invoke-Expression' cmdlet, which can execute arbitrary code. This indicates the code is trying to silently download and execute a potentially malicious executable on the victim's machine. The rest of the code is a typical Python setup script, likely used as a decoy or to appear legitimate. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily downloading and executing malware.",
