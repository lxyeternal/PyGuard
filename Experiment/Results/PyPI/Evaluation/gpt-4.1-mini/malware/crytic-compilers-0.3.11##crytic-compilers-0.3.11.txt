      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses an obfuscated exec statement to run an executable named 's.exe' located in the current directory, but only if the platform is Windows (sys.platform == 'win32'). This executable is run with subprocess.run and check=1, meaning it will raise an error if the executable fails. The use of exec with a conditional string to run an external executable is suspicious and not typical for a standard setup.py script. Running an arbitrary executable during package installation can lead to execution of malicious code, potentially compromising the system by installing malware, stealing data, or performing other harmful actions. Since 's.exe' is not a standard or known component of the package and is executed without any validation or user consent, this behavior is considered malicious.",
