      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command passed as a base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is decoded by PowerShell and executed silently without user awareness. The command is only run if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting it tries to avoid repeated execution or detection. The use of a hidden PowerShell process with encoded commands is a common technique to conceal malicious payloads or actions such as downloading and executing additional malware, establishing persistence, or performing unauthorized system modifications. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package, likely used as a decoy or to disguise the malicious payload within seemingly normal code. Overall, this behavior is indicative of malicious intent aimed at stealthily executing potentially harmful commands on the victim's machine.",
