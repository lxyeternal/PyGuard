      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. This command is base64-encoded and runs only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (github.com/T4hg/ee/raw/master/Stage1.exe). This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run a payload silently on the victim's machine. The use of hidden window style and encoded commands is intended to evade detection by users and some security tools. The rest of the code is a setup script that appears benign but is likely a disguise to mask the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is malicious as it downloads and executes potentially harmful software without user consent.",
