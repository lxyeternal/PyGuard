      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted at runtime with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows execution of arbitrary code that is hidden from static analysis. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to hide their true functionality until runtime. The code also specifies Windows as the target OS and uses obfuscated class names and meaningless metadata, which are common tactics to evade detection. Overall, this code is malicious because it executes hidden, encrypted code during installation, potentially compromising the system without the user's knowledge.",
