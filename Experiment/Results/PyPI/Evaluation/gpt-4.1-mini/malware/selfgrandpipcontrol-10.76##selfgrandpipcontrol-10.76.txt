      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor scripts that try to download or execute additional payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the system. The presence of a check for a folder named 'tahg' and the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' suggests an attempt to evade repeated execution or to mark infection. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or a way to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installer, further indicating malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute potentially harmful PowerShell commands on a Windows system, which constitutes malicious behavior.",
