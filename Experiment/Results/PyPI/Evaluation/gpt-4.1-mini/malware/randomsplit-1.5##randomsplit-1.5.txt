      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This PowerShell command invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a remote URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0). The execution is done silently without user knowledge or consent. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run a payload from the internet, potentially compromising the system by executing arbitrary code. The rest of the code is a seemingly benign setup script, likely used as a disguise to hide the malicious payload execution.",
