      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes a payload from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) or performs some unauthorized action on the system. The use of hidden execution, encoded commands, and conditional execution to avoid detection are common tactics in malware to stealthily run malicious payloads. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, which is a common technique to disguise malicious code within seemingly benign software.",
