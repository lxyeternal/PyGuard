      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a malicious Discord token stealer and credential harvester targeting Windows systems. It performs the following harmful actions:\n\n1. **Discord Token Theft:** It searches for Discord tokens stored in various browsers and Discord client folders by scanning LevelDB files and decrypting encrypted tokens using Windows DPAPI. It validates tokens and uploads them to a remote Discord webhook.\n\n2. **Credential and Cookie Theft:** It extracts saved passwords and cookies from browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge, Yandex) by accessing their local databases, decrypting stored credentials, and sending them to the attacker's webhook.\n\n3. **Steam and Roblox Token Theft:** It extracts Steam and Roblox authentication cookies, uses them to gather user profile information (such as wallet balance, games owned, user level), and sends this data to the attacker.\n\n4. **File Searching and Exfiltration:** It searches common user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents, Videos) for files with keywords related to passwords, wallets, tokens, and other sensitive data. It uploads these files to an anonymous file hosting service and sends links to the attacker.\n\n5. **Zipping and Uploading Sensitive Data:** It collects wallet data, gaming client data, and other files, compresses them into zip archives, uploads them to anonymous file hosting, and reports the links.\n\n6. **Persistence and Evasion:** It attempts to kill browser processes before accessing locked files to extract data. It also installs required Python packages if missing.\n\n7. **Use of Discord Webhook:** All stolen data (tokens, passwords, cookies, user info, file links) is sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL controlled by the attacker.\n\nOverall, this code is designed to silently steal sensitive user credentials and tokens from multiple applications and exfiltrate them to an attacker-controlled server, enabling account hijacking, identity theft, and financial fraud. This behavior is clearly malicious.",
