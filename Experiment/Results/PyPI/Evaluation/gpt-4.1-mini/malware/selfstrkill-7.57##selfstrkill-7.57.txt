      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is only run if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com with a path referencing 'Esquele'). This behavior is indicative of a downloader or dropper malware component that silently fetches and runs an external executable without user consent. The purpose is likely to install or run malicious software on the victim's machine, potentially leading to compromise, data theft, or further infection. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload.",
