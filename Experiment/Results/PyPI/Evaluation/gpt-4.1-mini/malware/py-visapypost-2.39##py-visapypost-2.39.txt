      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This PowerShell command is invoked only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded command decodes to a PowerShell invocation that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) under a subpath related to 'Esquele'. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and run a payload from the internet without user consent. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and analysis. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at downloading and executing potentially harmful software on the victim's machine.",
