      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to stealthily collect sensitive data related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet from the victim's computer. It searches for wallet configuration files, passphrases, seeds, two-factor authentication secrets, and potentially password files located in common user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It then compresses these files into a ZIP archive. The script gathers the victim's public IP address and country code to include in a message. Finally, it sends both the message and the ZIP archive containing the stolen wallet data to a remote Telegram chat via a bot token. This behavior constitutes data theft and exfiltration of sensitive cryptocurrency wallet information, which can lead to unauthorized access and theft of the victim's cryptocurrency assets. The code operates without user consent and attempts to clean up traces by deleting the ZIP archive after sending.",
