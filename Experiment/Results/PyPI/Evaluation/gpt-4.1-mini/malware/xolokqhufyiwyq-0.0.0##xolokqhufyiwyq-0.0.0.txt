      "malicious_behavior": "The code itself is a setup script for a Python package with an obfuscated and nonsensical package name 'xolokqhufyiwyq'. It declares dependencies on several suspicious third-party libraries: 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. Among these, 'browser_cookie3' is known to be used for extracting browser cookies, which can be used for session hijacking or stealing sensitive information. 'discordwebhook' can be used to send data to Discord channels, potentially exfiltrating stolen data. 'robloxpy' is a Roblox API wrapper, which could be used for automating actions on Roblox accounts, possibly for abuse or account takeover. The combination of these dependencies strongly suggests that the package is designed to steal browser cookies and send them to an attacker-controlled Discord webhook, or otherwise perform malicious actions related to Roblox accounts. The obfuscated package name and empty author fields further indicate an attempt to hide the package's true purpose. Therefore, while the code snippet itself does not contain explicit malicious code, it sets up a package that likely contains malicious payloads leveraging these dependencies.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious Roblox cookie grabber designed to stealthily extract the victim's Roblox authentication cookie (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers installed on the victim's machine. It uses the 'browser_cookie3' library to access cookies from Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, and Chrome browsers specifically for the 'roblox.com' domain. Once it obtains the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie, it validates the cookie using the 'robloxpy' library. If valid, it collects detailed user information such as UserID, RAP (Recent Average Price), friends count, account age, creation date, username, Robux balance, premium status, and profile URLs by querying Roblox APIs and external services. It also fetches the victim's public IP address. All this sensitive information, including the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie itself, is then sent to a remote Discord webhook controlled by the attacker. This allows the attacker to hijack the victim's Roblox account, potentially leading to account theft, unauthorized transactions, and privacy violations. The code also prints a dummy message to distract the user. Overall, this script is a clear example of credential theft malware targeting Roblox users.",
