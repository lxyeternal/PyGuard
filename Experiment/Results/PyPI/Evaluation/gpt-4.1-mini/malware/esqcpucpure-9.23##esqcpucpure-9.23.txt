      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command passed as a base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0). This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and run a payload from the internet without user consent. The rest of the code is a setup() call for a Python package, likely to disguise the script as a legitimate package. The presence of hidden execution, downloading and running an external executable from an untrusted source, and the use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) clearly indicate malicious intent.",
