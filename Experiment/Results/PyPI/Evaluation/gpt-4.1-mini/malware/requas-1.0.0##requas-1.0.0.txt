      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (GruppeInstall) that overrides the standard install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted with a hardcoded key. This decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the actual code behavior until runtime and circumvents static analysis. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution is a common technique in malware to evade detection. The exact behavior of the decrypted payload is not visible in the provided code, but the presence of this pattern strongly suggests that the code performs unauthorized or harmful actions on Windows systems during installation. This could include downloading additional malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. Therefore, this code is malicious.",
