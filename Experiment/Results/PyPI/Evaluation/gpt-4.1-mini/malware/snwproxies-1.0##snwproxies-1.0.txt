      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a malicious credential and token stealer targeting Windows users, specifically focusing on browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge, Yandex) and Discord clients. It performs the following malicious actions:\n\n1. **Token and Credential Theft:** It searches for Discord tokens and browser-stored passwords and cookies by accessing local files and decrypting them using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption with extracted master keys.\n\n2. **Data Exfiltration:** The stolen tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive information (such as billing info, friends list, badges, phone numbers, email addresses) are sent to a remote Discord webhook URL controlled by the attacker. This webhook acts as a data receiver, allowing the attacker to collect victim data remotely.\n\n3. **Persistence and Evasion:** The code attempts to install required Python packages if missing, uses threading to speed up data collection, and kills browser processes to access locked files. It also zips certain wallet and Steam data and uploads them.\n\n4. **Search for Sensitive Files:** It scans common user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files and folders with keywords related to accounts, passwords, secrets, wallets, and uploads them to an anonymous file hosting service.\n\n5. **Spoofing and Social Engineering:** The webhook messages are formatted with Discord embed styling, including emojis and user avatars, to make the stolen data look legitimate and enticing.\n\nOverall, this code is a fully featured stealer designed to silently harvest sensitive user credentials, Discord tokens, cookies, and wallet data, then exfiltrate them to an attacker-controlled server, posing a severe privacy and security risk to victims.",
