      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom installation command (GruppeInstall) that executes during the package installation process on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows execution of arbitrary code hidden from static analysis. The exact behavior of the decrypted payload is not visible in the source, but this pattern is commonly used to hide malware or backdoors that run silently during installation. The package name 'requesxs' and author details appear suspicious and likely fabricated to disguise the package. Overall, this code is malicious because it attempts to stealthily execute hidden code during installation, which can compromise the system, steal data, or perform other harmful actions.",
