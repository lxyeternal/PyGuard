      "malicious_behavior": "This code downloads and executes multiple executable files from a local server (http://127.0.0.1:5000), specifically a listener, a keylogger payload, and a reverse shell executable, saving them into the Windows Temp directory. It then runs the listener executable in the background. The purpose of these actions is to install and run spyware components on the victim's machine, including a keylogger to capture keystrokes and a reverse shell to allow remote control. This behavior is malicious as it compromises user privacy, enables unauthorized remote access, and can be used for further exploitation or data theft.",
