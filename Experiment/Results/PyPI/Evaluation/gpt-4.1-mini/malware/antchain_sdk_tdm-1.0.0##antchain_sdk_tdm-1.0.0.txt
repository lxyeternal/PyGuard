      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that, upon installation, collects sensitive environment information including the hostname of the machine, the current working directory, and the username of the user running the installation. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, where potentially sensitive system information is leaked to a third party without user consent. Such actions can be used for reconnaissance by attackers to gather information about the target environment, which can facilitate further attacks or exploitation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at unauthorized data collection and transmission.",
