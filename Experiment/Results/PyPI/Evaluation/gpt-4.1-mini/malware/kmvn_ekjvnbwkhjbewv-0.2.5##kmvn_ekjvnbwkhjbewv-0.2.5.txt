It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious and obfuscated external URL. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration or reconnaissance, where sensitive system details are leaked to an unknown third party without user consent. Such actions can be used for profiling the system for further attacks or unauthorized access, making the code malicious.",
