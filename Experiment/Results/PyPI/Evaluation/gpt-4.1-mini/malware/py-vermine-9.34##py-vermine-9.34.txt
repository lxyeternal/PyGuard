      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. The presence of the check for a directory named 'tahg' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' suggests an attempt to avoid repeated execution or detection. The PowerShell command likely downloads or executes additional payloads from a remote source (as indicated by the URL-like string in the encoded command). This behavior is typical of malware that tries to establish persistence or download further malicious components, potentially compromising the system. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of potentially harmful remote code, making it malicious.",
