      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor installation attempts, as it tries to run a potentially harmful or unauthorized script in the background. The script also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package, likely used as a disguise to hide the malicious payload. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of a PowerShell command that could compromise the system, making it malicious.",
