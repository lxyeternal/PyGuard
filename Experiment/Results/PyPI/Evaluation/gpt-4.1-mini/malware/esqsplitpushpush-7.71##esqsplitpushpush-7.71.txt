      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that invokes a web request to 'https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe' and outputs the response to a file named 'WindowsCache.exe'. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to silently download and possibly execute a payload from a remote server without user consent. The use of a hidden window and encoded command is intended to evade detection and user awareness. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup script, likely used as a disguise or to facilitate installation, but the embedded PowerShell invocation is clearly malicious and designed to compromise the system by downloading and potentially running unauthorized executable code.",
