      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior embedded in the custom install command class that overrides the standard setuptools install process. Specifically, during installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' module and a 'Fernet' class from a 'fernet' package, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is executed via Python's exec(), which can run arbitrary code. This behavior is suspicious and typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to hide their true functionality by encrypting the payload and only decrypting it at runtime. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can execute any code without the user's knowledge. The code also specifies Windows as the target OS in the classifiers, indicating the payload is designed for Windows environments. Overall, this code is malicious because it attempts to execute hidden, encrypted code during installation, which can lead to unauthorized actions, compromise of the system, or further malware installation.",
