      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using a Fernet symmetric encryption key. The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the actual code being run until runtime, making static analysis difficult. The obfuscated and random-looking metadata (name, author, description) further suggests an attempt to disguise the package. The executed payload could perform any arbitrary action, including downloading additional malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. This behavior is typical of malware that uses Python packaging infrastructure to execute hidden malicious code during installation.",
