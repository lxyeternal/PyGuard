      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior embedded in the custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it executes arbitrary code that is hidden from static analysis. This behavior can be used to download, install, or run malware silently during package installation. The obfuscation of class names and meaningless description strings further suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful code on Windows machines during the installation process, which is a common vector for malware distribution.",
