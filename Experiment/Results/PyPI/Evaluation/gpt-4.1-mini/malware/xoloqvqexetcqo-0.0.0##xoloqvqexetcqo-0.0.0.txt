      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious cookie grabber targeting Roblox users. It attempts to stealthily extract the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie from various browsers installed on the victim's machine using the 'browser_cookie3' library. This cookie is a sensitive authentication token that allows full access to the victim's Roblox account without needing a password. The script then validates the stolen cookie and, if valid, collects detailed information about the victim's Roblox account such as UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, and more using the 'robloxpy' API. It also fetches the victim's public IP address. All this sensitive information, including the stolen authentication cookie, is sent to a remote Discord webhook controlled by the attacker. This enables the attacker to hijack the victim's Roblox account, potentially leading to account theft, unauthorized transactions, and privacy violations. The code disguises its activity by printing a dummy loading message to distract the user. Overall, this script is designed to steal Roblox account credentials and personal data for malicious purposes.",
