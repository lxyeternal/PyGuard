      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process in a setuptools setup script. During installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the script and decrypted at runtime with a hardcoded key. Executing decrypted code at install time is a common technique used to hide malicious actions. The exact behavior of the decrypted payload is not visible in the source, but the use of encrypted code execution strongly indicates an attempt to conceal malicious operations, such as downloading additional malware, executing unauthorized commands, or compromising the system. This behavior is suspicious and characteristic of malware or backdoor installation routines.",
