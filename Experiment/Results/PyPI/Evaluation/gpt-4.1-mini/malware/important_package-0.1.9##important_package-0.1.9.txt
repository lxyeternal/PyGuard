      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information and environment variables, including the contents of the /etc/passwd file, environment variables, current working directory, user home directory, and system information. It then encodes this data in base64 and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious external URL ('https://pypi.org/reqs?d=' with a forged Host header 'psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net'). This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, where sensitive information is stealthily gathered and transmitted to a remote server controlled by an attacker. The use of a legitimate domain (pypi.org) with a forged Host header suggests an attempt to evade detection or bypass network security measures. Such actions can lead to privacy breaches, unauthorized access, and further exploitation of the compromised system.",
