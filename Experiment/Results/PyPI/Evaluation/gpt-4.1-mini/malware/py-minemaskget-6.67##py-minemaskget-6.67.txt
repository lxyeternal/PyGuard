      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. This command is base64-encoded and runs only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded command likely downloads or executes a payload from the URL 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/10797495475150594048/Esquele.exe' and saves it as 'x/WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and execute a malicious executable on the victim's machine without user consent. The use of hidden window style and encoded commands is intended to evade detection. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, which appears benign but is likely a cover to disguise the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code is malicious and poses a security risk by downloading and running an unknown executable from the internet.",
