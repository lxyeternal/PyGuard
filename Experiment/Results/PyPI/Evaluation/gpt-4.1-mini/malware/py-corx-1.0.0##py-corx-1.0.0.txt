      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command (GruppeInstall) that executes during the package installation process on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). Within this command, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded directly in the source code and is decrypted with a hardcoded key. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malicious code because it hides the actual payload from plain view and executes it dynamically during installation. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution (exec) is a common technique to evade detection and analysis. The exact nature of the decrypted payload is not visible here, but given the context, it likely performs unauthorized or harmful actions such as downloading additional malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. Therefore, this code is malicious as it attempts to execute hidden, encrypted code during installation, which can lead to system compromise or other malicious outcomes.",
