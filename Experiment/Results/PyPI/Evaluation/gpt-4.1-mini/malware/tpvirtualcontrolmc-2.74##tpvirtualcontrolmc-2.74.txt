      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor code that tries to download or execute additional payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the victim's machine. The presence of a check for a folder named 'tahg' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' (which appears suspicious) further suggests malicious intent. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW hides the execution window, making the activity stealthy. Overall, this code is designed to run hidden commands that could compromise system security, making it malicious.",
