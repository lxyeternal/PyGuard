      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload executed at the very beginning using base64 decoding and dynamic execution via builtins.exec and compile. This payload imports modules to create a named temporary file, writes a Python script into it that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/7bupb/raw), then runs this downloaded code and deletes the temporary file. This behavior is malicious because it silently fetches and executes remote code without user consent, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, compromise of the system, data theft, or further malware installation. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package, but the initial obfuscated code clearly indicates malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated and hidden payload executed at the very beginning via a base64-decoded string that is compiled and executed using builtins.exec and builtins.compile. This hidden code imports urllib.request and downloads and executes a remote script from 'https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/7bupb/raw' without user consent or any visible indication. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code as it fetches and runs external code dynamically, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, potential system compromise, data theft, or other harmful actions. The rest of the code appears to be a terminal color and animation utility library, which by itself is not malicious, but the initial hidden remote code execution makes the entire script malicious.",
