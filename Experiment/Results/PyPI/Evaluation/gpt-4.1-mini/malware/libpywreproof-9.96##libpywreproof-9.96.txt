      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that try to execute payloads or connect to remote servers covertly. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs the hidden PowerShell command. The presence of a suspicious URL in the comment (www.esquelesquad.rip) and the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands strongly indicate malicious intent. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or an attempt to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package installer, but the primary malicious action is the hidden execution of the encoded PowerShell command, which could download, install, or execute further malicious payloads, potentially compromising the system.",
