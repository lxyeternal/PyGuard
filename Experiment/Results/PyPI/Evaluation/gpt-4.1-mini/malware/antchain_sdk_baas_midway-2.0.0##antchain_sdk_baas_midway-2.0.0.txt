      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that, upon installation, collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username of the user installing the package. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, potentially compromising user privacy and security. Such actions are typical of malicious code aiming to gather reconnaissance data from infected systems.",
