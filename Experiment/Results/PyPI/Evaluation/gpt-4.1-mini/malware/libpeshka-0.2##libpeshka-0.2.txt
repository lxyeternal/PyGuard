      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a remote server (http://145.249.104.71/out) and saves it as a hidden file named '.drv' in the user's home directory. It then changes the file permissions to make it executable. After that, it appends a command to the user's '.bashrc' file to execute this downloaded file in the background every time a new shell session starts. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to persist on a system by running a potentially harmful or unauthorized executable on user login. The downloaded file could contain any form of malicious payload, such as a backdoor, keylogger, or other malware. The code only runs on Linux systems and silently fails on others. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily install and maintain persistence of a potentially malicious executable on a Linux system.",

It then changes the file permissions to make it executable. Furthermore, it appends a command to the user's '.bashrc' file to execute this downloaded file in the background every time a new shell session starts. This behavior effectively installs a persistent backdoor or malware on the victim's Linux system without user consent. The code only runs on Linux systems and exits with an error otherwise. The downloaded file could perform any malicious actions, such as data exfiltration, remote control, or further infection. This is a clear example of malicious code designed to stealthily install and maintain unauthorized access on a target machine.",
