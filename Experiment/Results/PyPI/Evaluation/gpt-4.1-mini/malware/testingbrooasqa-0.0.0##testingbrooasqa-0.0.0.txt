      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including base64 and custom decoding functions. It uses eval and exec on decoded strings, which is a common technique to hide malicious payloads. The code imports the 'base64' module and uses it to decode a large encoded payload, then further decodes and executes it dynamically. Such behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to conceal their true functionality and evade detection. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful operations, such as unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Therefore, this code is malicious.",
