      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a JAR file from a remote URL and saves it into the Windows Startup folder, which causes the JAR file to be executed automatically every time the user logs into Windows. It then immediately executes the downloaded JAR file using Java. This behavior is typical of persistence mechanisms used by malware to maintain execution on a system without user consent. The downloaded JAR file could contain any malicious payload, such as spyware, ransomware, or other harmful code. The use of a remote URL to fetch executable code and placing it in the startup folder without user knowledge or consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
