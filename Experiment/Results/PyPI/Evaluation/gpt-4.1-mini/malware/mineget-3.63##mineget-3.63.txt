      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command passed as a base64-encoded string via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command runs a PowerShell script that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com). The execution is done silently without user consent or awareness. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and run a payload from the internet covertly, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malicious activity. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call, but the initial hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent.",
