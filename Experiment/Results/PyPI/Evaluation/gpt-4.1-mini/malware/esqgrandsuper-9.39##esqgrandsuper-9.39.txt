      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a command that invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious domain 'dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm...'. This behavior is characteristic of malware attempting to stealthily download and run a potentially harmful executable from the internet without user consent. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. The presence of hidden execution, encoded commands, and downloading executables from untrusted sources confirms malicious intent.",
