      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor scripts that try to execute potentially harmful or unauthorized commands on the victim's machine. The use of a hidden window and encoded command suggests an attempt to evade detection and conceal the payload. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear benign. The presence of the suspicious PowerShell command execution makes this code malicious.",
