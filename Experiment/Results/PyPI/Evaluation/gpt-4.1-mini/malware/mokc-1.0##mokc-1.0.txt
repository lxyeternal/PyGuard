      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL (hosted on GitHub) and saves it locally with a suspicious filename 'tmp_file_pypi_29x7d0kf8.exe'. It then immediately executes this file using the Windows 'start' command. This behavior is malicious because it silently fetches and runs an unknown executable without user consent or verification, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or malware infection. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, likely to evade detection and facilitate distribution, but the core functionality is to deliver and run potentially harmful software on Windows systems.",
