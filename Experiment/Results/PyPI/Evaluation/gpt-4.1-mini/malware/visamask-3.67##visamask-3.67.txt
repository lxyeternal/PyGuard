      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or download and run additional malicious code covertly. The use of a hidden window and encoded command is a common technique to evade detection and user awareness. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate Python package setup call, likely used as a decoy or to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily execute potentially harmful PowerShell commands on a Windows system, which constitutes malicious behavior.",
