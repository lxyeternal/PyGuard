      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior embedded in the custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the actual code being run until runtime, making static analysis difficult. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to conceal their true functionality. The use of encrypted payloads executed during installation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine, potentially allowing the attacker to perform unauthorized actions such as data theft, system compromise, or persistence. The obfuscated class name and meaningless metadata further suggest an attempt to evade detection.",
