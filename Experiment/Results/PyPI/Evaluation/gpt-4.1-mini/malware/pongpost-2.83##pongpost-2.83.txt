      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a remote URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe?dl=0). This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and run a potentially harmful executable without user consent. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at downloading and executing unauthorized software, which could compromise the system.",
