      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a malicious credential stealer targeting Windows users, specifically focusing on extracting sensitive data from browsers, Discord clients, and other applications. It performs the following harmful actions:\n\n1. **Token Stealing:** It searches for Discord tokens stored in various Discord and browser directories, decrypts them if necessary, and verifies their validity. Valid tokens are then sent to a remote Discord webhook.\n\n2. **Password and Cookie Theft:** The code accesses browser databases (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge, Yandex, etc.) to extract saved passwords and cookies. It decrypts these using Windows DPAPI and AES-GCM with the browser's master key. Extracted credentials and cookies are saved locally and uploaded to an anonymous file hosting service, with links sent to the attacker.\n\n3. **File and Folder Exfiltration:** It scans user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files and folders with keywords related to accounts, passwords, backups, wallets, tokens, and other sensitive terms. These files are uploaded to an anonymous file hosting service, and links are sent to the attacker.\n\n4. **Application Data Zipping and Uploading:** The script collects data from wallets, gaming clients (Steam, Riot), Telegram, and other apps, zips relevant files, uploads them, and reports the links.\n\n5. **System and User Information Gathering:** It collects IP address, geolocation, username, Discord user info (badges, billing info, friends), and includes this metadata in the reports.\n\n6. **Persistence and Evasion:** The script attempts to install missing Python modules silently, kills processes of targeted applications to access locked files, and uses threading to speed up data collection.\n\n7. **Data Exfiltration:** All stolen data is sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL and anonymous file hosting services, enabling the attacker to retrieve sensitive user information remotely.\n\nOverall, this code is a comprehensive Windows credential stealer and data exfiltration tool designed to harvest Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and sensitive files, causing severe privacy breaches and potential account takeovers.",
