      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is decrypted with a hardcoded key and executed via exec(). This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malicious code because it hides the actual payload inside an encrypted blob, which is only decrypted and run during installation on Windows systems. The executed payload could perform any arbitrary actions, such as downloading malware, opening backdoors, or stealing data. The obfuscation via encryption and conditional execution on Windows strongly indicates an attempt to evade detection and target Windows users specifically. Therefore, this code is malicious and potentially harmful.",
