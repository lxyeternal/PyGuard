      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This PowerShell command invokes a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm.../Esquele.exe). The presence of the hidden execution, encoded command, and external download from an untrusted source strongly indicates malicious intent. The downloaded executable could be malware, potentially compromising the system by installing backdoors, stealing data, or performing other harmful actions. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, likely to evade suspicion.",
