      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor installation attempts, as it tries to run a potentially harmful or unauthorized script in the background. The script also checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists and only runs the command if it does not, which may be a persistence or anti-analysis technique. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of a PowerShell command that could compromise the system, making it malicious.",
