      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor installation scripts that try to run potentially harmful or unauthorized commands on the victim's machine. The script first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it runs the encoded PowerShell command, which likely downloads or executes malicious payloads or performs unauthorized actions. The use of 'WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flags further indicates an attempt to conceal the execution from the user. The rest of the code is a seemingly benign Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, this code contains hidden execution of potentially harmful PowerShell commands, which is a clear indicator of malicious behavior.",
