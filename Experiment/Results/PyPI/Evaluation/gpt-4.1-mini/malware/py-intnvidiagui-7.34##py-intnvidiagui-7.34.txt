      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that try to download or execute additional payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the system. The presence of a check for a folder named 'tahg' and the use of a suspicious domain 'www.esquelesquad.rip' in the comment further indicate malicious intent. The setup() call appears to be a decoy to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute potentially harmful commands on a Windows system, which constitutes malicious behavior.",
