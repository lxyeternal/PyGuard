      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The command references a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and attempts to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' into a hidden directory 'tahg' if it does not already exist. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and run potentially harmful executables on the victim's machine, which can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a setup script that appears benign but is likely a disguise to mask the malicious payload execution.",
