      "malicious_behavior": "This Python script is a malicious credential and data stealer targeting Windows users, specifically focusing on extracting sensitive information from browsers, Discord clients, and other applications. It performs the following harmful actions:\n\n1. **Token Stealing:** It searches for Discord tokens in various local storage and log files of browsers and Discord clients. It validates these tokens and uploads them to a remote Discord webhook.\n\n2. **Password and Cookie Theft:** The script extracts saved passwords and cookies from Chromium-based browsers by decrypting them using Windows DPAPI and AES-GCM with the master key. It collects URLs, usernames, passwords, and cookie data, then writes them to temporary files and uploads them.\n\n3. **Information Gathering:** It collects system information such as the victim's IP address, geolocation, username, and Discord account details (email, phone, badges, billing info, friends list) associated with stolen tokens.\n\n4. **File and Folder Exfiltration:** The script searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files and folders with keywords related to accounts, passwords, secrets, wallets, and tokens. It uploads these files to anonymous file hosting services.\n\n5. **Zipping and Uploading Sensitive Data:** It zips data from wallets, gaming clients (Steam, Riot), Telegram, and other apps, then uploads or prepares to upload these archives.\n\n6. **Persistence and Evasion:** It attempts to kill processes related to targeted applications to access locked files and uses multiple threads to speed up data collection.\n\n7. **Remote Exfiltration:** All stolen data is sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, allowing the attacker to receive the victim's sensitive information remotely.\n\nOverall, this code is a fully featured stealer malware designed to compromise user privacy, steal credentials, tokens, cookies, and sensitive files, and exfiltrate them to an attacker-controlled server. It poses significant security and privacy risks to infected users.",
