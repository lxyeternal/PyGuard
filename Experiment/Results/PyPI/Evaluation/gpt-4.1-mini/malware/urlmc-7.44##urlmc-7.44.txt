      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run without a visible window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag). This behavior is typical of malware trying to run a payload stealthily on a Windows system. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which may be a persistence or infection marker. The PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further malicious code from a remote source (the decoded command references a URL 'https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qm...'), which is a common technique for downloading and running malware. The rest of the code is a standard Python setup script, but the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent to run unauthorized code silently on the victim's machine.",
