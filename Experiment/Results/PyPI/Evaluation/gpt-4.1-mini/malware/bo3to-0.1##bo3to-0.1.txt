      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom installation command class 'gpl' that overrides the standard install process. During installation, it reads the system's '/etc/passwd' file to enumerate user accounts. For each user with a UID of 1000 (typically a regular user account on Linux systems), it attempts to open and then append a decoded payload string to that user's '.profile' file located at '/home/{username}/.profile'. The payload is an obfuscated string that is decoded using a ROT13-like cipher on printable ASCII characters. Writing to '.profile' means the payload will execute or be sourced whenever the user logs in or starts a shell session, effectively injecting persistent code into the user's environment without their consent. This behavior is malicious because it modifies user environment files stealthily during package installation, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution or persistence of unwanted code, which can be used for backdoors, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities.",
