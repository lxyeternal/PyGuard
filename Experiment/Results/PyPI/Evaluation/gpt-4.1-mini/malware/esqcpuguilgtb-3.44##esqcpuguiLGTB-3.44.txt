      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that try to download or execute additional payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the system. The presence of a check for a directory named 'tahg' and the comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' suggests an attempt to evade repeated execution or detection. The setup() call appears to be a decoy or cover to disguise the script as a legitimate Python package setup script. Overall, this code is malicious as it tries to stealthily run potentially harmful PowerShell commands on a Windows system, which could lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware infection.",
