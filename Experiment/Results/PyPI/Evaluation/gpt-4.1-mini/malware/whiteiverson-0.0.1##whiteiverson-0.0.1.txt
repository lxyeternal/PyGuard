      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to download and execute a potentially harmful executable file named 'MCCheat.exe' from a Discord CDN URL during the installation or development setup of the Python package. Specifically, the 'execute' function uses the 'requests' library to fetch the executable from a remote server and writes it to the local filesystem. It then runs this executable using 'os.system' with a command that attempts to bypass privilege restrictions ('set __COMPACT_LAYER=RunAsInvoker | start MCCheat.exe'). This behavior is malicious because it silently downloads and runs an unknown executable without user consent, which could lead to unauthorized code execution, system compromise, or installation of malware. The use of a Discord CDN URL to host the executable further suggests an attempt to evade detection or use a trusted platform for distribution.",
