      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a sophisticated malware, specifically a credential and data stealer targeting Windows systems. It performs multiple malicious actions including:\n\n1. **Credential Theft:** It extracts saved passwords, cookies, credit card information, and browsing history from various browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, Firefox, etc.) by accessing their local databases and decrypting encrypted data using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption.\n\n2. **Discord Token Stealing:** It searches for Discord tokens stored in local storage of Discord and other Chromium-based apps, decrypts them, validates them via Discord API, and collects user information.\n\n3. **System Information Gathering:** It collects detailed system information such as Windows product key, version, hardware UUID, RAM, disk size, IP address, geolocation, and more.\n\n4. **Clipboard Hijacking for Cryptocurrency Addresses:** It monitors the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet addresses and replaces them with attacker-controlled addresses to hijack crypto transactions.\n\n5. **Persistence:** It attempts to copy itself to the Windows startup folder to run on system boot.\n\n6. **Anti-Debugging and Anti-VM Checks:** It checks for virtual machine environments, debugging tools, and known analysis environments to avoid detection and terminate execution if found.\n\n7. **Exfiltration:** All stolen data, including screenshots, system info, tokens, passwords, cookies, and other files, are compressed and sent to a remote server via HTTP POST requests to a Discord webhook URL controlled by the attacker (https://kekwltd.ru/relay/bluescreen).\n\n8. **Process Killing:** Optionally kills Discord and related processes to prevent interference.\n\n9. **File Searching and Uploading:** It searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files with keywords related to passwords, wallets, tokens, etc., uploads them to a file-sharing service, and sends links to the attacker.\n\nOverall, this code is designed to stealthily steal sensitive user data, including credentials and cryptocurrency wallets, and send it to an attacker-controlled server, causing severe privacy breaches and potential financial loss.",
