      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This PowerShell command invokes a web request to download and execute a file from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com) under a hidden Windows cache executable name (WindowsCache.exe). The presence of the hidden execution, encoded command, and external download from an untrusted source strongly indicates malicious intent, likely to download and run malware on the victim's machine without their knowledge. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, which is a common tactic to disguise malicious payloads.",
