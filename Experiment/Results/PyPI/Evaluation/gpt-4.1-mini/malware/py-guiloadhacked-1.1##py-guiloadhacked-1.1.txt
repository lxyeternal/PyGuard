      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. The script references a URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) and attempts to invoke a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' into a hidden directory or location. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to download and run additional malicious payloads on the victim's machine. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and user awareness. The rest of the code is a setup script for a Python package, which appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at silently downloading and executing potentially harmful software.",
