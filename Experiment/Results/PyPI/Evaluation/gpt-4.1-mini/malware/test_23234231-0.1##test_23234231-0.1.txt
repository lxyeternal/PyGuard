      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains obfuscated and encoded payloads that are executed conditionally depending on the operating system. Specifically, if the platform is Windows ('nt'), it decodes and executes a base64-encoded binary file from the temporary directory, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malware behavior. For non-Windows systems, it decodes and executes a large base64-encoded Python script that performs various operations such as network requests, file system manipulations, and possibly downloading or executing further code. The code uses techniques like base64 encoding and exec to hide its true intent, which is a common tactic in malicious software to evade detection. The presence of strings related to system commands, network communication, and file operations, combined with the obfuscation, strongly suggests that this code is designed to perform unauthorized or harmful actions on the host system, such as downloading and executing malware, stealing information, or establishing persistence. Therefore, this code is malicious.",
