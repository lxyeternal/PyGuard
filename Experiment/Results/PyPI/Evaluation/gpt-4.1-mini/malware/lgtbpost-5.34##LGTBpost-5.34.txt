      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest call that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com). This behavior is characteristic of malware attempting to silently download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent or knowledge. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate setup script, likely used as a disguise or to appear benign. The primary malicious action is the covert download and execution of an external executable, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation.",
