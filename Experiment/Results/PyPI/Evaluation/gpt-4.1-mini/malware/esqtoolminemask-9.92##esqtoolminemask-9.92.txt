      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or connect to remote servers covertly. The comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the creation of a directory named 'tahg' (if it does not exist) suggest it is trying to establish persistence or download/execute further malicious components. The use of subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW hides the console window, further indicating an attempt to conceal its activity. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily executing potentially harmful PowerShell commands on the victim's machine.",
