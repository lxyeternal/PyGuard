      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install behavior when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted at runtime, then executed with exec(). This behavior is characteristic of malicious code attempting to hide its true intent by encrypting the payload and only decrypting it during installation. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script but performs hidden, potentially harmful actions during installation, which could include downloading further malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. Therefore, this code is malicious.",
