      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a malicious Discord token and credential stealer, commonly known as a 'stealer' malware. It performs the following harmful actions:\n\n1. **User and Environment Blacklisting:** It checks the current username, hostname, and MAC address against blacklists to avoid running on certain machines, likely to evade detection or analysis.\n\n2. **Discord Injection:** It forcibly terminates running Discord processes and injects malicious JavaScript code into Discord's desktop client files to maintain persistence or extend control.\n\n3. **Credential Theft:** It searches for Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data stored in various browsers and Discord client directories by decrypting encrypted data using Windows DPAPI and AES.\n\n4. **Data Exfiltration:** The stolen tokens, passwords, cookies, and other gathered information are sent to a remote attacker's Discord webhook URL. It also uploads files and zipped archives of wallets, gaming data, and other applications to anonymous file hosting services and sends the links to the attacker.\n\n5. **Persistence:** The script copies itself to the Windows startup folder to run automatically on system boot.\n\n6. **Information Gathering:** It collects detailed user information such as IP address, geolocation, Discord badges, billing information, friends list, and more, which can be used for further exploitation or identity theft.\n\n7. **Obfuscation:** The code contains many meaningless classes and functions with obfuscated names that serve no legitimate purpose, likely to evade static analysis.\n\nOverall, this code is designed to stealthily steal Discord tokens and other sensitive user data, exfiltrate it to an attacker-controlled server, maintain persistence on the victim's machine, and evade detection. It poses a significant privacy and security risk to infected users.",
