      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior embedded in the custom install command class that overrides the standard setuptools install process. Specifically, during installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' module and a 'Fernet' class (likely for symmetric encryption/decryption). It then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and immediately executes the decrypted code with exec(). This means that arbitrary, hidden code is run during installation without user knowledge or consent. The encrypted payload is obfuscated and not visible in the source, which is a common tactic to hide malicious code. Such behavior can be used to download malware, establish persistence, steal data, or perform other harmful actions on the victim's machine. The use of a cryptographic key and encrypted payload strongly indicates an attempt to evade detection and analysis. Overall, this setup script is malicious as it executes hidden, potentially harmful code during package installation.",
