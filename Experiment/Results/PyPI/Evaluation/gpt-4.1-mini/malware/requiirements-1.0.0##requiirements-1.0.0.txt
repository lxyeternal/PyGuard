      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior embedded in the custom install command class for setuptools. Specifically, during installation on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is decrypted with a hardcoded key and then executed via exec(). This technique is commonly used to hide malicious payloads from static analysis. The decrypted code is not visible directly, but the use of exec() on decrypted data strongly indicates that the installer runs hidden malicious code during package installation. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine, potentially allowing the attacker to download further payloads, steal data, or compromise the system. The obfuscation of class names, package name ('requiirements' with double 'i'), and meaningless description strings further suggest an attempt to evade detection.",
