      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in Base64. This PowerShell command invokes a web request to download and execute a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com). The execution is done silently without user consent or visibility. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and run a payload from the internet, potentially compromising the system by executing arbitrary code. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate, but the hidden PowerShell execution is clearly malicious.",
