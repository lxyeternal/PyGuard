      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoor code that tries to download or execute additional payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the victim's machine. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if this directory does not exist, which is a common technique to avoid repeated execution or detection. The rest of the code appears to be a decoy setup script for a Python package, likely to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, this code is malicious as it attempts to stealthily execute potentially harmful PowerShell commands on the host system.",
