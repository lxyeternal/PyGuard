      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard install process when the package is installed on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'). During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts and executes a payload using the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme. The encrypted payload is embedded in the code and decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows execution of arbitrary code hidden from static analysis. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to run hidden code during package installation, potentially compromising the system by downloading further payloads, stealing data, or establishing persistence. The obfuscation of the class name, package metadata, and the encrypted payload further supports the conclusion that this code is designed to conceal malicious activity.",
