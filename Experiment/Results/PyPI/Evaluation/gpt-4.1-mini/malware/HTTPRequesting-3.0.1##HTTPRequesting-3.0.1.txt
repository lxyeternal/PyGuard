      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that, during installation, downloads a Python script named 'ratfinal.py' from a Discord CDN URL and executes it immediately. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malware, specifically a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), as indicated by the filename 'ratfinal.py'. Executing a remote script during installation without user consent can lead to arbitrary code execution, unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise. The code disguises itself as a legitimate package but performs hidden malicious actions, making it dangerous and malicious.",
