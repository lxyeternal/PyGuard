      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the window style set to hidden and the command encoded in base64. This command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to an Invoke-WebRequest command that downloads and executes a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' from a remote URL (dl.dropbox.com). This behavior is characteristic of malware or a trojan attempting to silently download and run potentially harmful software on the victim's machine without user consent. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely used as a disguise or to appear legitimate. The primary malicious behavior is the covert download and execution of an external executable, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware infection.",
