      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class 'new_install' that registers a function '_post_install' to be executed at program exit (via atexit). The '_post_install' function performs several suspicious actions: it creates/appends a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with the text 'proof bug by kotko', then it retrieves the public IP address of the machine by querying 'https://api.ipify.org'. It also collects the hostname of the machine and the absolute path of the current script's directory. These three pieces of information (IP, hostname, and path) are concatenated, base64-encoded, and sent as a GET request parameter to an external URL 'https://kotko.org' with a query parameter constructed from the concatenation of the variables 'company' and 'name' and the encoded data. This behavior effectively leaks potentially sensitive information about the user's environment to a remote server without user consent or notification. Such data exfiltration is a common trait of malicious code embedded in packages, often used for reconnaissance or tracking. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly collecting and transmitting user environment data to an external server.",
