      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior. It downloads a JAR file named 'test.jar' from a GitHub repository to a temporary directory on a Windows system. Then, it attempts to download another ZIP file from a suspicious URL (dropbox.com link with query parameters) and extracts it. After extraction, it runs the downloaded JAR file using the Java executable with the '-jar' option. This behavior indicates that the script is designed to fetch and execute potentially harmful Java code from external sources without user consent. Such actions can lead to unauthorized code execution, system compromise, data theft, or installation of malware. The use of base64 encoding and exec to hide the actual code further suggests an attempt to evade detection.",
