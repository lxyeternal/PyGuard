      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a comprehensive malicious software (malware) designed to steal sensitive user data from a Windows system. It performs multiple harmful actions including:\n\n1. **Credential Theft:** It extracts saved passwords, cookies, credit card information, and browsing history from various browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, Firefox, etc.) by accessing their local databases and decrypting encrypted data using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption.\n\n2. **Discord Token Stealing:** It searches for Discord tokens stored in local storage of Discord and other Chromium-based apps, decrypts them, validates them via Discord API, and collects user information.\n\n3. **System Information Gathering:** It collects detailed system information such as Windows version, hardware UUID, Windows license key, RAM, disk size, IP address, geolocation, and more.\n\n4. **Clipboard Hijacking for Cryptocurrency Addresses:** It monitors the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet addresses and replaces them with attacker-controlled addresses to hijack cryptocurrency transactions.\n\n5. **Persistence Mechanism:** It attempts to copy itself to the Windows startup folder to run on system boot.\n\n6. **Anti-Debugging and Anti-VM Checks:** It checks for virtual machine environments, debugging tools, and known analysis environments to avoid detection and execution in sandboxed or monitored environments.\n\n7. **Data Exfiltration:** It compresses stolen data and uploads it to a remote server via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded webhook URL (https://kekwltd.ru/relay/bluescreen), which is likely controlled by the attacker.\n\n8. **Process Killing:** Optionally kills processes related to Discord and debugging tools to prevent interference.\n\n9. **Additional Data Collection:** It grabs Minecraft and Roblox data, including cookies and configuration files.\n\n10. **Remote Error Message Display:** Optionally shows fake error messages to the user to mask its activity.\n\nOverall, this code is a fully featured information stealer and credential harvester malware targeting Windows users, designed to silently collect and exfiltrate sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server, potentially leading to identity theft, account compromise, financial loss, and privacy invasion.",
