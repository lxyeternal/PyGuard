      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' option. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is run silently without user knowledge. This behavior is typical of malware or backdoors trying to execute payloads or establish persistence covertly. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which may be a marker to avoid repeated execution. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is a common technique to evade detection and analysis. The rest of the code is a typical Python package setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at covertly executing potentially harmful PowerShell commands on a Windows system.",
