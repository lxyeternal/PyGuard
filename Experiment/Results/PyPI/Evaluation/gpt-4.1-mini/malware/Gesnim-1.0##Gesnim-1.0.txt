      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL (hosted on GitHub) when run on a Windows platform. It saves this executable as 'tmp_file_pypi_29x7d0kf8.exe' and then immediately executes it using the 'start' command. This behavior is malicious because it silently fetches and runs an unknown executable without user consent or verification, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, potential system compromise, malware infection, or data theft. The rest of the code masquerades as a legitimate Python package setup script, likely to disguise the malicious payload delivery mechanism.",
