      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and compression to hide its true functionality. It imports 'marshal', 'zlib', and 'base64' modules to decode and decompress a large base64-encoded and zlib-compressed marshalled code object, which is then executed with exec(). This technique is commonly used to conceal malicious payloads. The sheer size and obfuscation level strongly indicate that the code is designed to evade detection and analysis. Such code often performs unauthorized actions such as downloading and executing malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. Without fully decoding and analyzing the embedded payload, the obfuscation itself and the use of dynamic code execution from compressed and encoded data is a hallmark of malicious behavior.",
