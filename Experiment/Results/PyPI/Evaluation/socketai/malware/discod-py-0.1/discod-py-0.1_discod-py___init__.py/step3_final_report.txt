  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code segments involving dynamic features (eval/exec), data processing functions, and external library usage.",
  "sinks": "Potential network connections, system calls, or data exfiltration points, though none are explicitly observed.",
  "flows": "Input sources through function parameters or environment variables to potential sinks like network or system commands, but no such flows are confirmed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic code execution features (eval/exec) and code complexity, but no concrete malicious activity or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious intent. Dynamic features are noted but not exploited maliciously. Obfuscation levels are low, and no suspicious data flows are identified. Confidence is high in benign assessment; obfuscation is minimal; malware is absent; overall security risk is low.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is safe based on current analysis, with no evidence of malicious behavior or significant security risks. Slight dynamic features do not elevate concern beyond low risk.",
