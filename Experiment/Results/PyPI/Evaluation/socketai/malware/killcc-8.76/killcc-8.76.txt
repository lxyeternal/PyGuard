      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, which strongly indicates malicious intent. The package appears benign in structure but is compromised by the stealthy, encoded payload execution. Given the techniques used, this package should be treated as potentially malicious until further decoding and analysis confirm its safety."
