  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the Python package 'pysofti'.",
  "sources": "Static strings in setup.py, including 'install_requires' list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or code execution points present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of 'random' (a standard library module) in 'install_requires'; 'request' likely a typo for 'requests'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static setup script for packaging. It does not contain dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscated logic. The primary anomalies are the inclusion of 'random' (which is unnecessary as it's part of the standard library) and 'request' (likely a typo for 'requests'). No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The description 'Python Crypter For Red Teaming' is suspicious in intent but not reflected in the code behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to dependency misconfigurations.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and static, with minor configuration issues. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The description hints at potential misuse but does not impact the code's safety. Correcting the dependency typo and removing unnecessary standard library dependencies is recommended.",
