{
  "purpose": "Import statements for a streaming application that handles video and audio streaming functionalities.",
  "sources": "The imported modules 'vidstream.streaming' and 'vidstream.audio' suggest the code reads data related to streaming and audio/video sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly include data sinks or any data output operations; it only imports classes.",
  "flows": "No executable code present; thus, no data flow from source to sink is demonstrated in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The imports are standard for a streaming application.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for classes related to streaming video and audio. There is no executable logic, data handling, or network communication shown. Without additional context or code, there is no indication of malicious behavior. The imports are typical for a multimedia streaming app, and no anomalies such as obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risk. It appears to be a standard set of imports for a streaming application. The overall security risk score is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
