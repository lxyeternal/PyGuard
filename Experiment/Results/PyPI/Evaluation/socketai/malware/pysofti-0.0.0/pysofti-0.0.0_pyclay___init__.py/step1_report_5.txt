  "flows": "No executable flow; only import statements, so no source-to-sink data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed in import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for a streaming package, including classes for streaming server, clients, and audio components. There is no executable logic, data processing, or network communication shown. As it is just import statements, it doesn't exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or potentially malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks. It appears to be a standard import of a streaming library for further use in a larger application.",
