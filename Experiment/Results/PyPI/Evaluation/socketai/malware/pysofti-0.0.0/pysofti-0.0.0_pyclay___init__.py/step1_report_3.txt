  "purpose": "Import statements for classes related to streaming video, screen sharing, and audio transmission, likely used in a media streaming or communication application.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'vidstream' package modules 'streaming' and 'audio'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are visible; these are import statements only.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed in the provided snippet; only class imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present in these import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports classes from the 'vidstream' package, which appears to be a media streaming library. There are no data inputs, external network communications, or code execution beyond imports. Without additional context or implementation, no malicious activity or security risks can be identified from these import statements alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements for streaming and audio classes. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are evident in this fragment.",
