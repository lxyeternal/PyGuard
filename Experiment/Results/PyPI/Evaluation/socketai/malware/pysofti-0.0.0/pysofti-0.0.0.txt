      "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and static, with minor configuration issues. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The description hints at potential misuse but does not impact the code's safety. Correcting the dependency typo and removing unnecessary standard library dependencies is recommended."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious activity, including remote code execution, obfuscation, stealth persistence, and dynamic evaluation. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified based on these behaviors. It should be considered highly malicious and pose significant security threats if executed."
