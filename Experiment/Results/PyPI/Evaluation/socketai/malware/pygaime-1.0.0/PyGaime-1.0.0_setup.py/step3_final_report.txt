{
  "purpose": "The code decrypts a static encrypted payload using Fernet during installation on Windows and executes it via exec(), indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The encrypted payload string, the Fernet decryption key, and the conditional execution block within the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The exec() call on the decrypted payload, which can execute arbitrary code, potentially malicious or harmful commands.",
  "flows": "On Windows, the code imports Fernet, decrypts the hardcoded payload with the static key, then executes the decrypted code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded encryption key and encrypted payload, obfuscated class and variable names, execution of decrypted code during install, conditional on Windows OS.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a custom install class that, during installation on Windows, imports Fernet, decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string with a static key, and executes the resulting code with exec(). The payload is obfuscated, and the key is static, indicating malicious obfuscation. The use of exec() on decrypted data during package installation is a classic malicious pattern, potentially executing arbitrary code. The code's behavior is suspicious, especially given the conditional execution only on Windows, which suggests targeted malicious activity. The high obfuscation, static secrets, and dynamic code execution strongly indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9, obfuscation ~0.8) are justified by these observations.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious and malicious behavior, decrypting and executing an obfuscated payload during installation on Windows. The static encrypted payload, use of exec(), and obfuscation patterns strongly suggest malicious intent, such as a backdoor or malicious payload deployment. The high malware and risk scores are appropriate. This package should be flagged and further analyzed before use.",
