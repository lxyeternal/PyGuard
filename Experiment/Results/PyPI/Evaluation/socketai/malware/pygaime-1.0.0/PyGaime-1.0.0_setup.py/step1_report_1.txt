{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'PyGaime', including custom installation behavior that executes encrypted code conditionally on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'setuptools', 'os', 'requests', and 'fernet'; execution of decrypted code within the custom install command based on OS detection.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via 'exec' function, which can run arbitrary code if the decryption is manipulated or if the Fernet key/message is compromised.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, 'exec' runs decrypted code, which is fetched from a static encrypted string, potentially executing malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hard-coded Fernet key and encrypted payload that decrypts and executes code during installation. The code appears obfuscated, with no clear purpose for the embedded encrypted data, and the decrypted code is executed directly.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration with a custom install class that, on Windows systems, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload and executes it via 'exec'. The encrypted payload could contain malicious code, and the use of 'exec' on decrypted data is a significant security risk. The code is obfuscated and includes no visible comments or documentation. It relies on static, hardcoded secrets, which suggests malicious intent or backdoor functionality. The rest of the setup code appears normal, but the conditional code execution during install on Windows raises high suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior due to decrypting and executing hidden payload during installation on Windows systems. The static encrypted payload and execution method strongly suggest a backdoor or malicious component embedded in the package. Overall, this package demonstrates high malicious potential.",
