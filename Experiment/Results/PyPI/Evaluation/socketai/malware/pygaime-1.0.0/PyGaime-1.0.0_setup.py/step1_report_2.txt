{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'PyGaime' with a custom install command that executes embedded code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules ('os', 'requests', 'fernet') and the embedded encrypted string within Fernet decryption.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decrypted code via 'exec', which can run arbitrary code, and network request 'requests' which may be used to communicate externally.",
  "flows": "During installation, if on Windows ('nt'), the code decrypts a Fernet-encrypted payload and executes it directly, creating a source-to-sink flow from decryption to execution.",
  "anomalies": "The use of encrypted payload executed at install time, along with the obfuscated class name and variable names, suggests an attempt to conceal malicious intent. No standard setup behavior requires such embedded decryption and execution.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py with a heavily obfuscated custom install command. When run on Windows, it decrypts a payload and executes it, which is highly suspicious. The payload is hidden behind Fernet encryption, preventing easy analysis, and only runs during installation, indicating potential malicious behavior. The rest of the setup code appears normal, but the malicious payload execution during install is a significant red flag.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious intent, executing encrypted code during installation on Windows systems, which could lead to system compromise or malicious activities. The obfuscation and conditional execution strongly suggest malicious behavior.",
