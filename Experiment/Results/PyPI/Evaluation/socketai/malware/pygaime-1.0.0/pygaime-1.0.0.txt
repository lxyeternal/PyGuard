      "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious and malicious behavior, decrypting and executing an obfuscated payload during installation on Windows. The static encrypted payload, use of exec(), and obfuscation patterns strongly suggest malicious intent, such as a backdoor or malicious payload deployment. The high malware and risk scores are appropriate. This package should be flagged and further analyzed before use."
