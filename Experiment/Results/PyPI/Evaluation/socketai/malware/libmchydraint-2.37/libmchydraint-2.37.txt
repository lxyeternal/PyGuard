      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It embeds an obfuscated PowerShell payload that contacts a malicious domain silently, indicating a significant security threat. The package setup appears legitimate but is exploited as a vector for malicious activity. The high obfuscation, stealthy execution, and suspicious URL justify a high malware and security risk score."
