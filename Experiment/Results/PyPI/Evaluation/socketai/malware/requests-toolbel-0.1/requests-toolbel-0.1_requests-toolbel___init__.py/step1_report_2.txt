{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or files.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to the console via print statements, possibly sent over the network, or stored in files or databases depending on further code context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or function arguments to sinks like output functions or network/database calls, passing through intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic code execution (exec or eval), obfuscated variable names, unnecessary complexity, or suspicious imports. Hardcoded secrets or credentials should be noted if present.",
  "analysis": "Initial review shows standard imports and functions. No immediate signs of malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. However, if dynamic execution or obfuscated code is used, this warrants closer inspection. The code does not perform obvious malicious actions like system damage, data theft, or covert communication within the visible sections. Lack of external network activity or system modification suggests low immediate risk. Nonetheless, incomplete context or hidden modules could pose future risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no clear indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no evidence of malware or supply chain sabotage. The confidence level is moderate due to possible obfuscated segments or incomplete context.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
