      "conclusion": "The code contains high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup, with silent error handling and conditional execution. The scores assigned are consistent with the evidence, and the package should be treated as malicious pending further payload analysis."
