{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy and general proxy errors to be used in error handling within a network application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inherit from standard exceptions; no data input or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; purely declarative class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are used as exception types, not involved in runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, clear, and standard for exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for various custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from built-in exception classes. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or embedded logic. The classes serve as error indicators and do not perform any operations. The code is free of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Given the absence of operational logic, data handling, or network activity, there are no security risks or malicious behaviors present. The reports correctly identify the benign and structural nature of the code, assigning high confidence scores and zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The code's simplicity and clarity support these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' evaluations are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
