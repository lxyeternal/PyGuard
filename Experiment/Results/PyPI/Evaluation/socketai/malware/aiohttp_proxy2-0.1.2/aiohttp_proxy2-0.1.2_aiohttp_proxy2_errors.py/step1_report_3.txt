  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy and connection errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; class definitions solely declare exception types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or sensitive data output present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; no runtime data processing or untrusted data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected; straightforward class inheritance for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class declarations inheriting from built-in exception classes to represent specific error types related to SOCKS proxy and connection issues. There are no functions, data processing, or suspicious constructs. It does not include any code that reads input, writes output, or performs network or system operations. No potential security risks or malicious behaviors are evident in this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions for error handling. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks.",
