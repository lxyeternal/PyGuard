{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output is performed.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input to output, or source-to-sink pathways present.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions with no operational logic, data handling, or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions, which is typical for structured error handling. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or obfuscated constructs. No hardcoded secrets, external calls, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears purely declarative, serving as error identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
