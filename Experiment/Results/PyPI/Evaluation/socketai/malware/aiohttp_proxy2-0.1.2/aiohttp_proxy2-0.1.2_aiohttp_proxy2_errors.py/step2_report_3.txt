  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the code to determine if the conclusions are justified and whether the scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or embedded logic. Therefore, there are no issues or vulnerabilities in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly state that the code is purely structural, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified because there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code only defines exception classes with no operational logic, no data handling, and no network activity, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified. The reports' scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \nGiven the absence of any suspicious or malicious code, the malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nThe reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they only describe the code's structure and purpose, which is standard for exception handling.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**. No malware or malicious intent detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at **0**. The code is benign and does not pose security risks.\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard set of custom exception classes for error handling in a SOCKS/proxy context. It is entirely benign, with no suspicious or malicious elements. The reports' conclusions are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe and poses no security threats.",
