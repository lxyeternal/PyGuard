  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy and general proxy errors.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or executable logic.\n   - The classes inherit from standard exceptions like `Exception` and `OSError`, which is typical for error handling structures.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observed.\n\n2. **Malware and Security Risks:**\n   - The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of class definitions.\n   - The security risk score is also 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of any operational or malicious code.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - The confidence score is 1 in all reports, which is reasonable because the analysis is consistent and thorough.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting the straightforward, clear code.\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Any Inconsistencies or Errors:**\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurately assess the code as benign.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions or Claims:**\n   - All reports correctly state that there's no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made, which is appropriate since the code is purely declarative.\n\n**Final Justification and Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be 0, given the absence of security risks.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments provided.** The code is standard, benign, and serves as part of an error handling framework for a SOCKS proxy library.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' evaluations and the actual code content.",
