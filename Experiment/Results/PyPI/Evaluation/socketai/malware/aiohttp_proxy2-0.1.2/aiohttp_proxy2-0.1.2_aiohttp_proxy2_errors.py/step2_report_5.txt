  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or any executable logic.\n   - The classes inherit from standard exceptions such as `Exception` and `OSError`, which is typical for error handling.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Assessment:**\n   - No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors.\n   - No data input/output, network activity, or data handling.\n   - The code appears to be boilerplate, serving as part of a larger error handling framework.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence score is 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n   - No issues are present in the code or the reasoning of the reports.\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the code as benign.\n\n5. **Any Reason to Adjust Scores?**\n   - Given the evidence, there is no reason to increase malware or security risk scores.\n   - The current scores seem appropriate and justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is purely declarative, defining exception classes for error handling.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns are evident.\n- The reports correctly assess the code as benign with high confidence.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the assessments provided and the nature of the code.",
