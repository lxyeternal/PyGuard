  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS and proxy errors.\n- There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or embedded logic.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks is present.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly state that the code is benign, purely structural, and standard for error handling.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, obfuscated score of 0, malware score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n- These scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n- No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since all reports indicate no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risks, the risk scores are appropriately set to 0.\n- The malware score is also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge claims based on assumptions**\n\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as simple exception class definitions.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made without basis.\n\n**Step 6: Check score consistency**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores align with the findings.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo changes needed. The reports correctly identify the code as safe and standard for error handling purposes.",
