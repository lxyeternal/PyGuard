{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS and proxy-related errors.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; exception class definitions do not read data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class definitions only establish exception types without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class definitions, no unusual or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, inheriting from base exception classes such as Exception and OSError. There are no functions, data processing, or data flow logic. The classes are typical in error handling contexts and do not contain any code that could be malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for error handling in a SOCKS/proxy library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is typical in structure and does not perform any operations or data handling. Overall, it appears benign.",
