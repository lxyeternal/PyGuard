  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or output; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; the code only declares classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various custom exception types related to SOCKS proxy operations and general proxy errors. These classes inherit from standard exception classes such as Exception, OSError, and SocksError, which itself inherits from Exception. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or embedded logic that could indicate malicious activity. The structure is straightforward and typical for defining exception hierarchies, with no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines custom exception classes for SOCKS and proxy errors. It contains no malicious behavior, no data handling, and no suspicious code. It appears to serve as a part of a larger project for error handling without any security risks or malware indicators.",
