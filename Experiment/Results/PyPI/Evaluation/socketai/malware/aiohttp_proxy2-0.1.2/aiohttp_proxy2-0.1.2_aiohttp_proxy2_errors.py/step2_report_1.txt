  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n- All reports confirm that the code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data sources, sinks, or data flows are present; the code is purely declarative.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 and indicate zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n1. **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n   Yes. The code is straightforward class definitions with no operational logic or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n   No. The reports are consistent and correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - Malware: 0 — appropriate, as no malicious activity is present.\n   - Obfuscated: 0 — correct, code is clear and straightforward.\n   - Security risk: 0 — justified, no security concerns are evident.\n\n4. **Justification for any higher risk scores:**  \n   Since there's no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All claims are based on direct analysis; no assumptions are made about hidden behaviors.\n\n6. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- The code is purely definitional, serving as part of an error handling framework.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
