  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy and connection errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data handling present; no potential for data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow as there are only class definitions without executable code or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from standard Python exceptions, used for categorizing and managing error states related to SOCKS proxies and connections. There are no input sources, no data processing, no sinks, or any code that executes actions. The classes serve as exception types for error handling in other parts of a program. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within these definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard practice for error categorization and does not pose any security threats.",
