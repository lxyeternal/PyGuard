{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package named 'aiohttp_proxy2', including some obfuscated code that executes base64-encoded Python script, potentially malicious or backdoor behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads sys.argv for command-line arguments, opens and reads the package's __init__.py file to extract version, and executes base64-decoded code within sb_proc() function.",
  "sinks": "The obfuscated base64-decoded code executes via exec(), which can run arbitrary code. It also writes logs to a temporary file. It may open network connections or perform other malicious actions within that code.",
  "flows": "Inputs from sys.argv trigger execution of sb_proc() via threading, which runs the decoded code. The __init__.py file is read to obtain version info. The decoded code may read or write files, perform network operations, or execute arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded code decoded and executed at runtime; obfuscated code using base64 and exec(). The script logs data to a temporary file. Version extraction via regex from __init__.py is standard, but the embedded code is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup script for a package, with a significant portion of obfuscated code that is base64-decoded and executed via exec(). The obfuscated code appears to include code for network requests, file handling, and potentially backdoor behaviors. The script also logs to a temporary directory, which could be used for data exfiltration or covert operations. While the rest of the setup is typical, the embedded base64 code and its execution are suspicious, indicating potential malicious intent or a backdoor. The script may be used to silently execute malicious code during installation or runtime.",
  "conclusion": "The presence of obfuscated base64-encoded code that is executed at runtime indicates likely malicious behavior. The code's structure suggests it may perform unauthorized actions such as network communication or data collection. Therefore, this package contains malicious potential and should be considered unsafe.",
