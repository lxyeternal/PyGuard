  "conclusion": "The code embeds a heavily obfuscated, base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically during setup, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The pattern of obfuscation, runtime code execution, and potential network activity warrants high suspicion. The package should be treated as potentially malicious, and further analysis of the decoded payload is recommended."
