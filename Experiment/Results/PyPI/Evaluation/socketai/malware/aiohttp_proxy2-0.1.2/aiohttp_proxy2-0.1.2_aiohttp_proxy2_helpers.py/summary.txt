  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to the handling of user inputs, which is standard in such scenarios. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate."
