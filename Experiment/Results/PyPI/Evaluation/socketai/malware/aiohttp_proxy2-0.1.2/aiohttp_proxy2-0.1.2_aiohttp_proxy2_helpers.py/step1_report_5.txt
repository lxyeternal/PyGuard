{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to create and open network connections through SOCKS proxy servers, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5.",
  "sources": "Parsing proxy URL, user input parameters for host, port, and proxy URL, and function calls to open or create connections.",
  "sinks": "Creating socket wrappers, establishing connections via sock.connect(), and asyncio.open_connection() and create_connection().",
  "flows": "Input URLs and connection parameters are parsed and validated, then used to instantiate proxy sockets, which establish connections to target hosts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns. Proxy URL parsing includes unquoting user info, which is standard. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely parses proxy URLs, validates inputs, and creates socket wrappers for SOCKS proxies. Connection functions are asynchronous, leveraging asyncio for network operations. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The functions are designed for legitimate proxy handling and connection establishment, with appropriate error handling for invalid inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for proxy connection handling using asyncio and SOCKS proxies. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security exploits. The functions are straightforward, and the code follows best practices for input validation and error handling.",
