{
  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous functions to establish network connections via SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxies, including URL parsing and socket creation.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL components (scheme, host, port, user info), user-supplied host and port parameters",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, asyncio's open_connection and create_connection functions",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url extracts proxy details -> create_socket_wrapper creates socket -> open_connection/create_connection establish connection to target host via socket",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard validation and exception handling present",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard proxy URL parsing, socket wrapper creation, and connection establishment using asyncio. It validates inputs, handles exceptions, and uses trusted libraries. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The proxy handling relies on user-supplied URLs and parameters, which could be misused but do not constitute inherent vulnerabilities. The code's structure and logic are straightforward and align with typical proxy connection implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to the handling of user inputs, which is standard in such scenarios. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
