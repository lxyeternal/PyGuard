{
  "purpose": "Provides a custom proxy connector for aiohttp supporting various proxy types and DNS resolution options.",
  "sources": "Proxy configuration parameters, external helper functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`), socket creation, URL formatting.",
  "sinks": "Proxy URL construction, socket connection establishment, request proxy update.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) used to generate proxy URL and socket; socket connection for non-HTTP proxies; request update with proxy URL.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; external helper functions' behavior assumed benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard aiohttp proxy connector with configurable proxy types, optional DNS resolution bypass, and socket creation for non-HTTP proxies. It constructs proxy URLs dynamically, manages socket connections appropriately, and updates requests with proxy info. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the initial reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential configuration risks but do not indicate active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured proxy connector with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect a low security risk. No modifications are necessary.",
