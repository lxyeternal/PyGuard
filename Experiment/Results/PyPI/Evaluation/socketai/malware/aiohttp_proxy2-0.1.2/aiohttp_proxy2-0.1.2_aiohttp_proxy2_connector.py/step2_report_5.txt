  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard aiohttp proxy connector with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No suspicious behaviors or code obfuscation are present. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate. The high confidence reflects the thoroughness.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements a customizable proxy connector with standard logic, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The security risk is slightly above zero, possibly due to the use of external helper functions and URL handling, but nothing indicates malicious intent. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines classes for proxy handling, with standard practices, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning matches the code. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns. The slightly elevated security risk score accounts for external functions, but overall, the assessment is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Custom proxy connector with standard handling, no malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No suspicious activity detected, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Proxy connection handler, standard implementation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in all reports, justified by external helper functions and URL handling, but no real security issues are evident.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a proxy connector for aiohttp.\n- No modifications needed based on the current analysis.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to external dependencies and URL handling, but no actual vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a well-structured, standard proxy connector with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
