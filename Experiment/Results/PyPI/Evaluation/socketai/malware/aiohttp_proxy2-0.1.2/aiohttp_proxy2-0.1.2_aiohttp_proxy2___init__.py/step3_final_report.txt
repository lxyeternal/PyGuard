{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or interface for a SOCKS proxy library, importing components and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or network operations present",
  "flows": "No data flows; purely static import/export structure",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and clear",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup module that imports classes, functions, and constants from local modules, defines a version string, and specifies __all__ for exports. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No further analysis or modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
