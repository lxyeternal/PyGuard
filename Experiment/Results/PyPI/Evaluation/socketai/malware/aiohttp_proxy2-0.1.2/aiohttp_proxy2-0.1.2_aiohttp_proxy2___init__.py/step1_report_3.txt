{
  "purpose": "This code defines imports and exports for a proxy connection library, likely used to handle SOCKS proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data output occurs in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard module setup and re-exporting of classes/functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports specific classes and functions from internal modules and defines an explicit version and exported symbols. There are no user inputs, environment variables, or external data sources. The code structure suggests a module initialization pattern. No suspicious or malicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module definition with import/export statements for a SOCKS proxy library. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard, safe library scaffolding.",
