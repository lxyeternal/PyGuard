{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a proxy client library, managing SOCKS proxy connections, errors, and helpers.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, and .proto.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potentially malicious actions. The code primarily exports classes, error types, and functions.",
  "flows": "Imports and exports are straightforward; no data flow analysis reveals any untrusted data transmission or malicious processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code structures observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines import statements, module metadata (__version__, __all__), and organizes exports for other parts of the package. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations within this fragment. It serves as an entry point or interface for the library. No signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a standard module setup file for a proxy library, containing only import and export definitions. It does not perform any operations, data handling, or network communication that could be malicious or insecure.",
