{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module metadata, import various components from other modules, and export a public API for a proxy-related package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only sets up imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, defining a version, and exporting symbols via __all__. No input handling, data processing, or untrusted data flows are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious operations are evident. The structure suggests this is a module initializer or API definition file, with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward module setup file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as an interface or API aggregation for a proxy-related package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious payloads.",
