{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a proxy connection library, defining imports and exposing components for establishing and managing SOCKS proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code primarily imports and re-exports components",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules to external use via the exported __all__ components; no untrusted data flow identified",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected; no obfuscation or unusual code constructs",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes and functions from local modules and defines an explicit list of exports (__all__). It does not process input, execute dynamic code, or interact with external data sources directly. It serves as a module interface for a SOCKS proxy library, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module interface setup for a proxy connection library. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are evident. It appears to be a benign component intended for code reuse and modular design.",
