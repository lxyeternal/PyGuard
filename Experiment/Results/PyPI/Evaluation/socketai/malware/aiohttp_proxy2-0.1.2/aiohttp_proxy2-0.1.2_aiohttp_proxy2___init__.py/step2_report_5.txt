  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Overview:**\n   - The code is a module that imports specific classes, functions, and constants from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).\n   - It defines a version string and an `__all__` list to specify the public API.\n   - The code contains no executable logic, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated segments, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports uniformly describe the code as a straightforward module setup for a SOCKS proxy library.\n   - They highlight the absence of untrusted data sinks, malicious behaviors, or anomalies.\n   - The analysis consistently indicates the code's benign nature, serving as an interface or API aggregator.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and no anomalies or security risks are identified.\n\n3. **Logical Consistency & Score Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since there's no evident security concern.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Given the code's simplicity and the thoroughness of the reports, there are no grounds to suggest any higher risk or malware scores.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or contain malicious payloads.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\n- The code is a standard module initialization file, with no malicious or security-risk behaviors.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and justified.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threat.",
