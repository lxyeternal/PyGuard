{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a Python package that provides SOCKS proxy connection functionalities, including error handling, connection helpers, and proxy type definitions.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and symbols from local files: connector, errors, helpers, and proto.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any obvious sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "The code imports various components and exposes them via __all__, but does not include executable flow logic or data processing pipelines.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs. The code mainly consists of imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module initialization script that imports specific classes and functions from local modules, defines a version, and specifies what symbols to export. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code flows. It appears to be a straightforward package setup file.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks. It functions as an organizational and import/export hub for a SOCKS proxy-related package.",
