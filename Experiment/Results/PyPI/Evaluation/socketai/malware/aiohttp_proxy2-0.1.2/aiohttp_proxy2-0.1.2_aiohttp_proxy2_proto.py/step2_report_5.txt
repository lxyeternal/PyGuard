  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described behaviors with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS4/5 proxy wrappers, handles standard protocols, error handling, and address resolution. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent. The risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable, reflecting typical proxy usage risks.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard SOCKS proxy implementation, no malicious behavior or obfuscation. Proper error handling and protocol adherence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the code. The low risk score is appropriate given the functionality.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are reasonable. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard SOCKS4/5 handling, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The code appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SOCKS proxy wrappers, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The code is consistent with typical proxy client implementations.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same observations; standard implementation, no malicious behaviors, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The code is typical for proxy wrappers, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—no malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, which is consistent; the code is clear, standard, and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports, indicating low inherent risk, which is reasonable given the functionality.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code performs standard, well-understood SOCKS proxy operations.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise.\n- The error handling and network operations are typical and do not suggest malicious intent.\n- The low risk score (0.2) accurately reflects the inherent risks of using proxy code, which depends on proxy trustworthiness, not the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard proxy usage risks, no additional concerns)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the provided code and reports.",
