{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network connections, including negotiation and connection setup.",
  "sources": "Reads include: user input (host, port, username, password), address resolution via getaddrinfo, socket data received during negotiation, and network I/O (sock_sendall, sock_recv).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow into socket send operations, particularly in the _send method, and into address resolution functions. Data received from network during negotiate functions could be exploited if maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Sources such as host, port, username, password, and DNS resolution data flow into socket communication and proxy negotiation steps. Data received from socket (res) can be misused if maliciously crafted, potentially leading to protocol misinterpretation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present; the code appears to follow standard protocols. No obfuscated code, nor unusual dynamic execution or misleading variable names. No suspicious network domains or hidden backdoors evident. The code adheres to expected SOCKS protocol behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard asynchronous socket operations for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies, including connection, negotiation, and address resolution. It handles errors properly, raising exceptions on failures. There are no indications of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. All network data flows are related to proxy communication, with proper exception handling. No suspicious side-effects or malicious signals detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with appropriate error handling and protocol adherence. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a standard, security-conscious network communication module.",
