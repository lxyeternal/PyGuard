  "purpose": "Implement SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers for asynchronous network communication, handling connection, negotiation, and error cases.",
  "sources": "Host and port inputs for proxy connection, hostname resolution, user credentials for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations, data sent over the network during connection and negotiation phases.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) flows into socket connection and negotiation methods, resulting in an established proxy connection for data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code follows standard protocols and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients using asyncio. It performs address resolution, handles authentication, and manages network connections with proper error handling. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code does not leak data or perform covert operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and inherent risks of proxy usage, which depend on proxy trustworthiness rather than code quality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting typical proxy operation risks but not indicating any malicious or suspicious activity.",
