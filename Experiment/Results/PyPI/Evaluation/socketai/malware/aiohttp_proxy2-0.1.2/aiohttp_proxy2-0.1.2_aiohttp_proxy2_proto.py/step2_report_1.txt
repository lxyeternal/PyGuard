  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the issues, reasoning, and scores, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers, handling connection, negotiation, and error cases. No suspicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code adheres to standard protocols, with proper error handling and no signs of malicious intent. The low risk score aligns with the absence of suspicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard implementation, proper error handling, and no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and well-justified. The reasoning aligns with the code's structure and behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard SOCKS proxy implementation, no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Justified and consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Continues the pattern—standard, protocol-compliant SOCKS proxy wrappers, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard implementation, no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis indicating no malicious behavior, backdoors, or covert channels.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports. This is a low but non-zero value, reflecting the inherent risks of using proxy code—primarily if misconfigured or connecting to malicious proxies—but not due to code itself.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (reasonable given the context, but not indicating high danger)\n\n**Additional note:** Given the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented SOCKS proxy wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\nThis reflects a secure, standard implementation with minimal inherent risk.",
