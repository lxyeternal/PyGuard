{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, providing methods to establish proxy connections and handle authentication.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters (host, port, username, password) during initialization, and data from network sockets during connection and data transmission.",
  "sinks": "Network socket send and receive functions, especially in 'sock_sendall' and 'sock_recv' methods, which handle potentially untrusted network data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided parameters (host, port, credentials) into socket connection procedures, through the negotiate and connect methods, and during data transmission via socket send/recv functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors observed. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or misleading variable names. Error handling appears standard. The code performs standard network proxy connection functions with appropriate exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for handling SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections, including authentication and address resolution. It performs network operations such as connecting to proxy servers, resolving hostnames, and establishing tunnels. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or covert channels. All network interactions follow expected patterns for proxy communication. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or privacy violations are evident. Usage of external libraries is standard, and error handling appears appropriate. The code could be exploited if misconfigured (e.g., connecting to malicious proxies), but that is inherent to proxy usage, not malicious code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for network connections, with proper error handling and typical functionalities. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected. The code is well-structured and adheres to expected proxy protocol behaviors.",
