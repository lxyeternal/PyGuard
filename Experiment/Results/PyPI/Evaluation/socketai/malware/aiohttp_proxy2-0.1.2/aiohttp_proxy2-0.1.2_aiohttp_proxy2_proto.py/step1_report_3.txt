{
  "purpose": "This code implements proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling asynchronous network connections through proxies with support for authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads input from hostnames, ports, user credentials, and network address resolution functions.",
  "sinks": "Sends and receives data over network sockets, performs address resolution, and handles proxy negotiation and authentication.",
  "flows": "Input data such as host, port, credentials -> connection and negotiation methods -> network data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious or malicious code segments. Proxy connection logic appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy handling, with methods for establishing connections, resolving addresses, authenticating (including username/password), and handling responses from proxy servers. Usage of standard socket functions and asyncio loop methods is appropriate for asynchronous network operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data exfiltration behaviors are evident. Error handling is consistent with expected network communication errors. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of proxy socket wrappers with proper error management and standard protocols.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It adheres to expected protocol flows, handles errors appropriately, and does not contain any indicators of malware or security risks.",
