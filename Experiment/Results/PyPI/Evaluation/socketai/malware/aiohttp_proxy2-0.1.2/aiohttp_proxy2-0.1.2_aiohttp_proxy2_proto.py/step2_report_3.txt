  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident. Error handling and protocol adherence are appropriate. No suspicious data flows or code anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2 (low risk), confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a typical proxy client implementation, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a standard SOCKS proxy wrapper with proper handling of authentication, address resolution, and network communication. No malicious behaviors or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous report; no issues identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, the code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation. No backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. Proper error handling and protocol compliance.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.95.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the previous assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard SOCKS proxy wrapper, handling connection, authentication, and address resolution properly. No signs of malicious activity or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior reviews; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard SOCKS proxy implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Proper handling of network operations and errors.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Justification:\n\n- **Code Content:** The code snippets provided are a straightforward implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients using asyncio, with proper handling of authentication, address resolution, and network communication.\n- **Malware Potential:** No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert channels. The code does not perform any suspicious data exfiltration, command execution, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear, with standard variable names and no obfuscated segments.\n- **Security Risk:** The inherent risk in proxy code depends on configuration and trustworthiness of proxies, not the code itself. The code is standard and does not introduce additional vulnerabilities.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are apparent. The code adheres to protocol standards and includes appropriate error handling.\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, inherent to proxy usage but not due to code quality)\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, considering the nature of proxy code, which could be misused if connected to malicious proxies, but that is outside the scope of this code's intrinsic security.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that the proxies used are trusted, as the code itself does not contain any malicious elements.",
