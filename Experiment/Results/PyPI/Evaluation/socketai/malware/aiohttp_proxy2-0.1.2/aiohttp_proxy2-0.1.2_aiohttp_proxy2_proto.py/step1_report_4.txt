{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers to facilitate network communication through proxies, including connection negotiation and address resolution.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from network responses (_receive method calls), hostnames and addresses passed to methods (e.g., host and port parameters), and internal request data constructed in _send method calls.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially flow into network requests via user-provided hostnames, usernames, or passwords, and into network responses when receiving data from proxy servers.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input (hostnames, credentials) flow into request construction (e.g., _build_dest_address, _socks_auth), which is sent over sockets, and responses are processed to determine success or failure. The flow does not include data exfiltration or code execution pathways.",
  "anomalies": "There are no indications of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors. The code performs standard network socket operations, address resolution, and protocol negotiation. No suspicious obfuscation, data leaks, or external command execution are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections with methods for connecting, authenticating, and address resolution. It carefully handles network I/O, address encoding/decoding, and error handling. No parts suggest malicious intent; all operations are consistent with proxy communication. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected. The code adheres to standard practices for asynchronous socket handling in Python. The only concern could be misuse if malicious user input is provided, but this is typical for proxy libraries and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs typical network operations for proxy negotiation and connection, with proper error handling. There are no signs of malware or supply chain attacks within this module.",
