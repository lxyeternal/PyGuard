{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, facilitating proxy connections with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads include input parameters such as host, port, username, password, and data received from network socket operations during negotiation and communication.",
  "sinks": "Network socket send and receive operations, especially sock_sendall and sock_recv, which could potentially transmit or receive untrusted data. Also, potential use of address resolution functions that might leak DNS information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (host, port, credentials) through address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation to network send/receive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code uses standard socket and asyncio operations with proper exception handling. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio-based socket communication, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 with optional username/password authentication. It performs address resolution, handles SOCKS protocol negotiation, and manages socket connections with proper error handling. There are no hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors; the code's functions align with typical proxy client functionality. All network data flows are consistent with expected proxy connection processes. No anomalies indicating sabotage or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded credentials or backdoors and follows standard practices for network communication and exception handling.",
