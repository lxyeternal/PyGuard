  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Accurately describes the code's function—implementing SOCKS4/5 proxy wrappers with proper error handling. Sources and sinks are correctly identified.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious or malicious activity detected; code follows standard protocols.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. The low security risk score (0.2) is reasonable, given the potential for misuse if a malicious proxy is configured, but this is inherent to proxy use, not malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly states the code's function—SOCKS proxy handling with standard network operations.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No signs of backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. The code is a typical SOCKS proxy implementation with no malicious signals.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to above, accurately describing standard proxy wrapper functions.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious elements or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment is consistent; the code appears legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly identifies the code's function and data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly describes the code's functionality.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** All reports describe standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy wrappers. No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are apparent in the code snippets. The error handling and protocol adherence are appropriate.\n- **Scores Justification:**\n  - Malware score: **0** across all reports is justified; no malicious activity detected.\n  - Obfuscated: **0** is correct; code is clear and standard.\n  - Risk score: **0.2** is reasonable, reflecting the inherent risk in proxy usage but not due to malicious code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (as currently assigned)\n- **Confidence in assessment:** High (above 0.9), given the thorough review and consistency.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is a standard, secure implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.",
