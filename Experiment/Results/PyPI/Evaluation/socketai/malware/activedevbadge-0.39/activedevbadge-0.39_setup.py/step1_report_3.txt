  "purpose": "Custom setup process that clones repositories and moves files to startup directories to execute scripts or binaries on system startup.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), environment variables, git clone commands, os.listdir(), and os.startfile()",
  "sinks": "os.rename(), os.startfile() to move and execute potentially malicious files or scripts",
  "flows": "Retrieve login info -> create directories -> clone repositories -> move script files -> execute a binary at startup",
  "anomalies": "Cloning repositories into startup folders and executing an EXE automatically at install time; use of hardcoded paths; no user consent prompts; potential persistence mechanism",
  "analysis": "The script modifies environment variables and creates directories in system startup locations. It clones two repositories from GitHub into startup folders, which can lead to persistent malicious code execution. The renaming of script files and auto-start of executables suggest an intent to maintain persistence. Cloning and executing code without user consent or validation poses significant security risks. The code does not perform any validation or checks for the cloned content, raising suspicion of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code establishes persistence by cloning repositories into startup folders and executing a program without user consent. It employs techniques common in malware for maintaining persistence and potentially executing malicious payloads. Due to the cloning and auto-execution of external code and binaries, this code poses a high security risk.",
