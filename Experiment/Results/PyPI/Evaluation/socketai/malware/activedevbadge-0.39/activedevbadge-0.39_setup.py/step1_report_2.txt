{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to set up a Python package and perform post-installation actions that involve downloading and executing code from external repositories, as well as manipulating startup folders for persistence.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), os.getlogin(), os.listdir(), git.Git.clone(), os.startfile()",
  "sinks": "os.rename(), os.startfile()",
  "flows": "Environment variable setup and directory creation -> cloning repositories from GitHub -> moving files to startup folder -> executing a .exe file",
  "anomalies": "Cloning external repositories into startup folders, moving script files into startup directories, executing a downloaded .exe file without validation, using hardcoded paths and GitHub URLs for code retrieval, manipulating startup folders for persistence.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies environment variables and creates directories within startup locations, potentially for persistence. It clones two repositories from GitHub into startup directories, which could be malicious if the repositories contain harmful code. It then moves a script file into the startup folder and executes a specific .exe file from the startup directory. The code lacks validation or checks on the downloaded content, indicating potential for malicious payloads to be executed automatically on system startup. The actions resemble techniques used by malware to establish persistence, execute malicious scripts, and run unauthorized code. The package setup itself appears legitimate, but the post-installation process exhibits suspicious behavior consistent with malware activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs actions that could establish persistence and execute arbitrary code from external sources without validation, which are common malicious techniques. Although the package may appear legitimate, the behavior during installation is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malware, with high likelihood of malicious intent.",
