  "purpose": "Obfuscated script likely intended to execute hidden or malicious code, possibly for code injection or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads input from encoded strings, base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and dynamic evaluation of decoded bytecode.",
  "sinks": "Uses eval on dynamically generated code, potentially executing malicious payloads, and decompressing code from external encodings.",
  "flows": "Decodes base64 string -> decompresses -> decodes further -> dynamically evaluates code -> executes obfuscated payload.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, dynamic eval usage, base64 and zlib decoding, and complex lambda functions designed to hide intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules (random, base64, codecs, zlib), then constructs a large, obfuscated string. It defines functions that decode and decompress encoded payloads. The core part involves decoding base64 data, decompressing it with zlib, then executing the resulting code via eval. The obfuscation, combined with dynamic code execution and multiple encoding layers, strongly suggests malicious intent, such as hiding a backdoor, malware, or data exfiltration routines. No legitimate, transparent functionality is apparent. The code appears designed to evade detection and run concealed malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with multiple layers of encoding and dynamic execution, indicative of malicious intent. It likely executes hidden payloads, backdoors, or performs unauthorized actions. High suspicion for malicious behavior and significant security risk.",
