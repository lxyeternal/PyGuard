  "anomalies": [
    "Heavy obfuscation with multiple layers of encoding (base64, zlib, character transformations)",
    "Use of eval() on dynamically constructed strings",
    "Complex, unnecessary transformations that obscure true intent",
    "Embedding large payloads in encoded strings and executing them at runtime"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script imports modules like random, base64, codecs, and zlib but uses them to decode and decompress embedded data rather than for legitimate purposes. It constructs code snippets dynamically through multiple transformations, including arithmetic operations on hardcoded integers, and then executes these snippets via eval(). The embedded data is encoded and compressed, likely representing malicious payloads or commands. The code's structure and heavy obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent, aimed at evading detection and executing hidden code upon execution. The presence of functions that perform complex string and data transformations before running eval() indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated, decoding and executing embedded payloads through dynamic transformations and eval(). These characteristics point to malicious intent, such as executing hidden malicious code, making it highly dangerous. It should be considered malicious and unsafe to run.",
