  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, heavily obfuscated, and intended to execute concealed payloads, posing a high security threat. The use of eval() on decoded data and layered encoding confirms malicious intent. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware likelihood is confirmed."
