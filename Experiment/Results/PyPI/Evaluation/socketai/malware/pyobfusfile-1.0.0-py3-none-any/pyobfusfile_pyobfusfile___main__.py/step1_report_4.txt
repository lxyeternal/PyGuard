  ],
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing common encoding and compression libraries, then defines obfuscation maps and functions that generate code dynamically through complex lambda functions and string manipulations. It uses base64 and zlib to decode embedded payloads, which are then executed via eval(). The repeated use of eval() and dynamic code execution, combined with heavily encoded data, indicates an intent to conceal malicious activities. The presence of nested encoded payloads that are decompressed and then executed suggests that the code is designed to run hidden or malicious scripts. The overall structure and obfuscation techniques strongly point toward malicious intent, likely to execute hidden code or malware without detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and designed to execute hidden payloads through dynamic decoding, decompression, and eval execution. Its structure, encoding techniques, and use of eval() strongly suggest malicious intent, aiming to conceal malicious behavior and evade detection. It qualifies as malware with a high security risk score.",
