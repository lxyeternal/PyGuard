    "Import statements for 'random', 'base64', 'codecs', 'zlib' - used for data processing and decoding.",
    "Obfuscated string variables and lambda functions that generate or decode code at runtime.",

  "flows": [
    "Obfuscated code constructs strings and decodes data from base64 and zlib, then executes it via eval/exec.",
    "Data processed through lambda functions and multiple layers of decoding, likely to hide malicious payloads.",
    "Execution of payloads that are dynamically assembled at runtime."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Heavy obfuscation with multiple string encodings, lambda functions, and runtime code execution.",
    "Use of eval/exec to run dynamically decoded strings, which can be malicious.",
    "Embedded base64-encoded data and zlib compressed data that are decoded and executed without transparent visibility.",
    "Lack of clear, legitimate purpose, typical of malware or malicious scripts."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing modules used for data manipulation and obfuscation. It constructs complex strings and functions that decode and decompress embedded payloads. These payloads are then executed via eval/exec, which is a common technique for hiding malicious actions such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The layered encoding (base64, zlib) and dynamic code execution strongly suggest intent to evade detection and conceal malicious behavior. Overall, the code's structure, obfuscation, and runtime code execution points to malicious intent with a high likelihood.",
  "conclusion": "This script is highly suspicious and appears to be malicious, employing obfuscation and runtime code execution to hide its true purpose. It likely executes hidden payloads that could harm the system or exfiltrate data. Due to these factors, it should be considered malware with high confidence.",
