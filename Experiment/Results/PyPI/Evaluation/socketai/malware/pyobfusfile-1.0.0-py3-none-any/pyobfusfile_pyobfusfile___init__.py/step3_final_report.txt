  "purpose": "A trivial Python function that prints a message, with a comment referencing an external URL.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; only a comment referencing github.com/codeuk/evilpip.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the function simply prints a static message.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment referencing an external URL 'github.com/codeuk/evilpip', which could be suspicious but is not active code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward function with no input/output, data processing, or malicious operations. The only anomaly is the comment referencing 'evilpip', which is external metadata and not executable. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. The security risk score is minimal (~0.1), justified by the suspicious comment but not by code behavior. Confidence in benignity is high (around 0.9), given the simplicity and lack of malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and safe. The only concern is the comment referencing a potentially malicious external module, which warrants external investigation but does not impact the code's security. Scores are consistent with the analysis and should remain as is.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
