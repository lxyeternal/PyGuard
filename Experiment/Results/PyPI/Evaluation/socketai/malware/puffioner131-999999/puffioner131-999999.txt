      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-confidence malicious behavior by covertly exfiltrating environment variables during package setup to a suspicious external URL. The activity is consistent with supply chain attacks or malicious package behavior. The high malware and security risk scores are justified, and the code should be considered malicious. Usage of this package is strongly discouraged."
