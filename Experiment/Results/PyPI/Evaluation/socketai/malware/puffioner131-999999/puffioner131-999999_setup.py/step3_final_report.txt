{
  "purpose": "The code collects all environment variables during installation and development commands and exfiltrates them to a suspicious external URL, indicating malicious intent to steal potentially sensitive data during package setup.",
  "sources": "os.environ.items() during run methods of PostInstallCommand and PostDevelopCommand",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending data to http://eewtrzyimp165no1u4kqfhv0nrtih95y.oastify.com",
  "flows": "Environment variables are collected via os.environ.items(), URL-encoded, and sent via POST request to the external URL during both install and develop commands",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of exfiltrating environment variables during package setup without user consent; suspicious URL; no legitimate reason for such exfiltration in setup scripts",
  "analysis": "The code overrides standard setuptools commands to include a step that gathers all environment variables and sends them to a remote server via HTTP POST. This behavior is consistent across both commands. The URL used is suspicious and likely malicious. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and performs network activity during setup, which is atypical and indicative of malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.9-1, securityRisk: 0.9-1, obfuscated: 0) are justified given the exfiltration of sensitive data to an external server without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-confidence malicious behavior by covertly exfiltrating environment variables during package setup to a suspicious external URL. The activity is consistent with supply chain attacks or malicious package behavior. The high malware and security risk scores are justified, and the code should be considered malicious. Usage of this package is strongly discouraged.",
