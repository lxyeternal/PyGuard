  "purpose": "Define setup procedures for a Python package, including custom install and develop commands that send environment variables to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.environ.items(), fetching data from the environment, and using urllib.request.urlopen to send HTTP POST requests.",
  "sinks": "Sending environment data to a remote server through URLopen with POST method; potential data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are collected from os.environ, URL-encoded, then transmitted via HTTP POST to a suspicious domain.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated code blocks for install and develop commands, transmitting all environment variables unencrypted to an external server, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom setup commands that, upon execution, collect all environment variables and send them to a remote URL controlled by an external party. This behavior occurs during both install and develop phases. The remote server URL appears suspicious and is unlikely to be legitimate. There is no user consent or security indication for this data transmission, suggesting an intent to exfiltrate environment data. The code itself is straightforward and not obfuscated but performs an unexpected and potentially malicious action. The data flow indicates an intentional exfiltration of environment data, which could include sensitive information.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious behavior by secretly collecting and transmitting environment variables to an external domain during package installation and development. This indicates a supply chain attack vector or malicious package designed for data exfiltration. The overall security risk is high due to the covert data transmission to a suspicious domain.",
