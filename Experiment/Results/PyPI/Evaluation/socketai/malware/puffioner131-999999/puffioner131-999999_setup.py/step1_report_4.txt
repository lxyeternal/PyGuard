  "purpose": "The code defines custom setup commands that, during installation or development setup, send environment variables to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via os.environ.items()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending data to external URL",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> URL-encoded data -> POST request via urlopen()",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional sending of all environment variables to an external, potentially malicious, server during installation/development commands without user consent or notification",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and overrides install and develop commands to include code that transmits all current environment variables to a specific external URL. This behavior occurs automatically during both installation and development setup phases. The data transmission uses urllib to send a POST request, which could include sensitive information such as environment variables that may contain secrets, credentials, or other private data. The URL used is suspicious and suggests potential data exfiltration or malicious tracking. No other functionality or user interaction is present, and the code does not sanitize or inform users about this data transmission. The code is simple, straightforward, and includes no obfuscation, but the malicious intent of exfiltrating environment data is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly transmits all environment variables to an external server during package installation or development setup, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. This behavior indicates intentional data exfiltration, constituting malicious activity.",
