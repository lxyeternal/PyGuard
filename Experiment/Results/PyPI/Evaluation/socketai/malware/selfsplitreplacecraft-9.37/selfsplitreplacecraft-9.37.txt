      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious activity or backdoor functionality. The assigned scores are appropriate, but slightly increasing malware and risk scores to 0.85-0.9 reflects the severity of obfuscated, covert remote code execution. This package should be treated as malicious or compromised until further payload analysis confirms benign intent."
