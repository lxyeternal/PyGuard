  "purpose": "Detects obfuscated PowerShell command execution in setup script, indicating malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of hidden, encoded PowerShell command; potential data exfiltration or remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check -> condition false -> subprocess executes encoded command -> command runs silently in background.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command; execution triggered only if 'tahg' directory absent; broad exception handling masks errors; suspicious URL comment.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a filesystem check, then executes an obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with hidden window, which is typical for malicious payloads. The command is base64-encoded, likely to conceal malicious intent. The broad try-except blocks suppress errors, potentially hiding failures or malicious fallback. The comment URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' adds suspicion. The setup() call appears benign but is exploited as a vector for malicious code. The obfuscation, hidden execution, and suspicious URL collectively indicate high malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered under specific conditions, with a suspicious URL comment. These are strong indicators of malicious activity, such as remote code execution or payload download. The overall security risk is high, and malware likelihood is significant.",
