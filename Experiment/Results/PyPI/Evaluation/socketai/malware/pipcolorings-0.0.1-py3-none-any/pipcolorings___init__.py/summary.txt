  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent and appropriately score the code's security posture. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present. The overall security risk remains very low, with a maximum of 0.2 due to potential dynamic evaluation concerns. Scores and reasoning are justified and do not require adjustment."
