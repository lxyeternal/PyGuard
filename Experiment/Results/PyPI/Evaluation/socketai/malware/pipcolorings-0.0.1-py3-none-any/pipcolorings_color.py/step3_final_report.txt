{
  "purpose": "The code downloads remote Python code from a specified URL and executes it via exec, then attempts to run the current Python interpreter with a temporary file as an argument, likely for malicious persistence or execution.",
  "sources": "Reads code from the URL 'https://paste.fo/raw/afb1dbd35339', writes to a temporary file, and reads the temporary file for execution.",
  "sinks": "Executes fetched code via exec(), launches a system process with the current Python executable and the temporary file, potentially executing malicious payloads or persistence mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Fetches remote code from URL -> writes to temp file -> executes code via exec() -> launches process with temp file as argument.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obfuscated import aliases, minimal error handling with try-except blocks that suppress errors, dynamic code execution, and process launching based on filename manipulation, indicating obfuscation and stealth tactics.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a temporary file, writes a payload that fetches and executes remote code, then attempts to run the current Python interpreter with the temp file as an argument. The use of obfuscated import aliases and suppressed errors suggests an intent to hide malicious activity. The pattern of remote code fetch, dynamic execution, and process launching is characteristic of malware loaders or backdoors. The code's behavior is consistent with malicious intent, posing high security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through remote code fetching and execution, obfuscation, and process manipulation. It should be classified as highly malicious with maximum security risk. The malware score is set to 1, the obfuscation score around 0.8, and the security risk score at 1, reflecting the high threat level.",
