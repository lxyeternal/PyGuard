  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, input/output data, environment variables, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows leading to data leaks, system modifications, or network transmissions.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks, such as input data processed and sent over network or stored locally.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "All reports with no code or minimal information correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, assigning low malware and obfuscation scores. Reports with detailed analysis (Report 5) find no suspicious patterns, with high confidence. Minor inconsistencies in confidence scores for reports lacking code (Reports 3 and 4) are noted; these should be adjusted to zero for consistency, as no analysis is possible without code. Overall, the scoring aligns with the evidence, and no significant issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are accurate and consistent; no malicious or obfuscated code is present. The risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of the code snippets or absence thereof.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
