  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high potential for malicious use due to its ability to download and place files into the startup folder without validation, facilitating persistence. The behavior aligns with common malware tactics, and the scores reflect a high suspicion level. It should be flagged as potentially malicious, especially in security-sensitive contexts."
