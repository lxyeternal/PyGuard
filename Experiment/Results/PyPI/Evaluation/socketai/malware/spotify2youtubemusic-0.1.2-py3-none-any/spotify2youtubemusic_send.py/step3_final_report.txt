  "purpose": "A simple function to send a message via Telegram API using provided token, chat ID, and text.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: token, chat_id, text",
  "sinks": "requests.post call with URL and parameters",
  "flows": "Input parameters used directly in URL and request; no external data flow beyond function call",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward API call",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a URL with the provided token and sends a POST request with chat_id and text. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. Input parameters are used directly, which could be misused if malicious, but this is typical for such utility functions. The code is a standard implementation for messaging via Telegram API, with minimal security risk. All reports agree on its benign nature and assign a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the potential for misuse if parameters are malicious, but not a flaw in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of a Telegram message sender with no malicious features or obfuscation. The potential for misuse exists if parameters are malicious, but this is external to the code logic. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
