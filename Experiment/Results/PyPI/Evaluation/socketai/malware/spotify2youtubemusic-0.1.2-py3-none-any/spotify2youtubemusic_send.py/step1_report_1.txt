  "purpose": "The code is designed to send a message via the Telegram Bot API.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters: token, chat_id, and text.",
  "sinks": "Performs an HTTP POST request to the Telegram API endpoint with the message data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct the URL and request payload; data flows from function arguments to an external network request.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The URL construction is straightforward and uses parameters. No evidence of obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The function 'send_message' constructs a URL with a provided token and sends a message to a specified chat ID. It uses standard 'requests.post' with URL parameters. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code does not perform any data collection, logging, or malicious activity. It simply acts as a client to the Telegram Bot API, which is common for chatbots or notification systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of sending a message via Telegram's API with no indications of malicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate utility function without malicious intent.",
