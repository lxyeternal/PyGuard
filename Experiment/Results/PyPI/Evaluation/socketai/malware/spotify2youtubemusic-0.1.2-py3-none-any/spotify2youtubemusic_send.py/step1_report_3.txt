  "purpose": "Send a message via the Telegram Bot API using provided token, chat ID, and message text.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (token, chat_id, text), URL construction with token",
  "sinks": "requests.post call that sends data over the network to Telegram API endpoint",
  "flows": "Input parameters (token, chat_id, text) flow into URL construction and request payload; request executes the network call",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, straightforward implementation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to send messages via Telegram API. It takes in a bot token, chat ID, and message text, then constructs a URL and makes a POST request to send the message. The code uses user-supplied parameters directly in the request. While this could be misused if parameters are controlled maliciously (e.g., sending spam or malicious content), there is no evidence of malicious intent or backdoors within the code itself. The code does not store, leak, or exfiltrate data on its own; it simply performs a straightforward API call. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a Telegram message sender. There are no signs of malicious activity or backdoors. It could be misused if the parameters are malicious, but this is dependent on user input rather than malicious code design.",
