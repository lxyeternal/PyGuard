  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicative of malicious activity. The presence of a suspicious URL comment and error suppression further support this. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a malware score of 0.8 and overall risk of 0.85 are justified based on the evidence."
