  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during setup, strongly indicating malicious intent. The embedded command likely facilitates remote code execution or payload download, posing a significant security threat. The setup function itself appears benign. Overall, the package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious until further decoding confirms its payload."
