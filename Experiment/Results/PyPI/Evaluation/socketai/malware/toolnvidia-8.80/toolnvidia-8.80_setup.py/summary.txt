  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.85,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious behavior. The scores assigned are consistent with this assessment. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is necessary for definitive confirmation, but current evidence warrants caution and treating this package as potentially malicious."
