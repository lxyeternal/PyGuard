  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The external URL and stealth techniques strongly suggest malware activity, such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The package should be treated as malicious or compromised until further analysis confirms otherwise."
