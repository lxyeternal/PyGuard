{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed for stealing sensitive information such as Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and files from various browsers, Discord, and other applications. It then uploads this data to remote servers (including Discord webhooks and file hosting services) for unauthorized access.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from browser storage directories, Discord data, login credentials from browser SQLite databases, and local files on the user system. It also retrieves system info, IP address, and geolocation via network requests.",
  "sinks": "The script sends collected data to remote webhooks and file hosting services. It also executes system commands like killing processes, installing packages, and writing files. Data flows from system sources (browsers, apps) to network endpoints (webhooks, file hosts).",
  "flows": "Input sources include browser storage, Discord files, and local credential stores. These data points are decrypted, processed, and then sent via HTTP POST requests to configured webhooks and upload services. Additionally, data is written to local temp files before upload.",
  "anomalies": "The code installs missing Python modules automatically, which is suspicious. It uses process termination commands to kill applications, and the code actively searches for and exfiltrates browser credentials, cookies, and tokens. Functions like 'uploadToken' and 'upload' send data to external URLs, including Discord webhooks, which is typical for malware but unusual for legitimate scripts. Presence of hardcoded webhook URL, attempt to decrypt stored credentials, and the systematic exfiltration process are suspicious. Also, the code appears obfuscated or malicious in intent due to its behavior and data handling.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive info stealer targeting browser credentials, Discord tokens, and other sensitive user data. It gathers tokens from browser and Discord files, decrypts stored passwords and cookies, and uploads this data to external servers via webhooks and file hosting services. The code also installs dependencies automatically, kills browser or application processes, and performs ZIP archiving of data for exfiltration. Its structure and functions strongly suggest malicious intent, as it actively seeks and exfiltrates sensitive user information without user consent. The use of hardcoded webhooks, automatic package installation, and system commands further confirms malicious behavior. Overall, this code is designed for unauthorized data theft and exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior, primarily acting as a data stealer targeting user credentials, tokens, cookies, and files across multiple applications and browsers. It exfiltrates data to remote servers, employs process termination, and automates dependency installation—behaviors typical of malware. The script’s purpose, functionality, and data flow all point toward a malicious intent, making it highly risky for use or execution.",
