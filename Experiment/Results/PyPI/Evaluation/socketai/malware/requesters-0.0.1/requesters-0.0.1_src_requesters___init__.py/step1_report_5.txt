{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract and exfiltrate sensitive user data, including Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers and applications, then upload this data to remote servers or Discord webhooks.",
  "sources": "User inputs from browser storage (log files, leveldb databases, SQLite databases), environment variables, local files such as 'Login Data' and 'Local State', and network responses from geolocation and Discord API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Remote server uploads via HTTP requests (requests.post, urlopen), Discord webhook URL (hook), and file uploads (uploadToAnonfiles), which transmit collected sensitive data externally.",
  "flows": "Sources such as browser databases, log files, environment variables, and API responses feed data into processing functions that decrypt, parse, and compile sensitive information (tokens, passwords, cookies, user info), which then flow into upload functions transmitting data to external servers or Discord webhooks.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive data collection with no user consent, including decrypting stored passwords and cookies, extracting Discord tokens, and searching for files containing sensitive keywords. It kills processes like browsers and Steam to access files, downloads dependencies automatically, and uses hardcoded webhook URLs. The code is structured for stealth and rapid data exfiltration, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive information stealer targeting browser credentials, Discord tokens, and personal files. It employs techniques to decrypt stored passwords and cookies, collects tokens from browser and Discord data files, and uploads the information to external servers via webhooks and file hosting services. It kills processes to access locked files, loads dependencies dynamically, and searches specific directories for sensitive files and data matching predefined keywords. The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malware, including process termination, stealthy data extraction, and external exfiltration. Its design aligns with typical credential and data theft tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior, functioning as an information stealer targeting user credentials, tokens, cookies, and files. It employs multiple techniques to decrypt and extract sensitive data from browsers and applications, then exfiltrates this data to external servers or Discord webhooks. Its actions, such as process termination, stealthy file access, and automatic dependency installation, further confirm its harmful intent.",
