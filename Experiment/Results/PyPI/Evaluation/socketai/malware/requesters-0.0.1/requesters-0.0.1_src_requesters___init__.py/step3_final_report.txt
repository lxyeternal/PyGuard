{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious data stealer, targeting browser credentials, Discord tokens, cookies, files, and system information, then exfiltrating this data via webhooks and file uploads.",
  "sources": "Browser storage files, local state files, log files, environment variables, and specific directories for Discord, Steam, Telegram, and browsers.",
  "sinks": "External webhooks via requests and urlopen, file uploads to anonymous file hosting services, and local file zipping for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local files, decrypted using Windows DPAPI functions, processed, and then sent through HTTP requests or uploaded as zip archives.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, silent dependency installation, process termination commands (taskkill), threading for concurrent operations, misleading function names, redundant code segments, and some obfuscation hints.",
  "analysis": "The script exhibits comprehensive malicious behaviors typical of info-stealing malware: decrypting stored credentials, harvesting tokens, cookies, and files, then exfiltrating via webhooks and file uploads. It uses Windows cryptography APIs for decryption, searches common directories for sensitive data, employs threading for efficiency, and includes silent dependency installation. The presence of hardcoded webhooks, process killing commands, and obfuscation hints further confirm malicious intent. The code's structure and functions align with known stealer malware patterns, with no evidence of benign or legitimate functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, actively stealing user credentials, tokens, cookies, and files, then exfiltrating this data to external servers. Its behaviors, techniques, and embedded exfiltration channels confirm its high threat level.",
