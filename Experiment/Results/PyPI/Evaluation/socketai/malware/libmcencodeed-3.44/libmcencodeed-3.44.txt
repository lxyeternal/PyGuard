      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during package setup, indicative of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation, silent error handling, and conditional execution strongly suggest malicious activity. The package should be treated as malicious until further payload analysis confirms otherwise."
