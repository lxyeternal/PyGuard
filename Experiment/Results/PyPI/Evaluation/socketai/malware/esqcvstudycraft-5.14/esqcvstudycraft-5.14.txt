      "conclusion": "The package contains a stealthy, obfuscated PowerShell payload triggered conditionally, connecting to a suspicious domain, indicative of malicious intent. The high obfuscation and hidden execution warrant classification as high risk, with a malware score around 0.8. The package should be flagged for further analysis and potential quarantine until the payload is decoded and verified safe."
