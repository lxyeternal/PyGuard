{
  "purpose": "The code downloads and executes remote files, potentially to run malicious payloads or establish persistence.",
  "sources": "URL sources: https://kekw.battleb0t.xyz/neu2.exe and https://kekw.battleb0t.xyz/dcbot",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded files via subprocess.call; running java commands",
  "flows": "Download remote executable -> save to APPDATA -> execute; check java version -> if present, download and save a JAR file to Startup -> execute with java",
  "anomalies": "Automatically executes downloaded files without validation; writes to startup folder for persistence; checks for java version before downloading the second payload; hardcoded URLs; no validation of downloaded content",
  "analysis": "The script begins by downloading an executable from a remote URL and immediately executing it, which is suspicious and indicative of potential malware. It then checks if Java is installed by executing 'java -version'. If Java is present, it proceeds to download a JAR file and places it into the Windows Startup folder, establishing persistence. Both downloads are from hardcoded URLs, and the code runs the files without validation or verification. The behavior suggests intent to run potentially malicious payloads and establish persistent access on the target system.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote files, including establishing persistence via the Startup folder, and performing system reconnaissance (checking Java version). These actions are typical of malware. The code lacks any validation, and the hardcoded URLs and automatic execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",
