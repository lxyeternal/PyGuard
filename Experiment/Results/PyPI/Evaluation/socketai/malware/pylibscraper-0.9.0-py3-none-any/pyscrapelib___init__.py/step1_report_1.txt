It also checks for Java installation, and if found, downloads another payload to the startup folder and executes it, indicating attempts at persistence.

The code exhibits behaviors typical of remote access trojans or backdoors.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"This script exhibits multiple malicious behaviors, including downloading, executing, and persisting malicious payloads without validation.
