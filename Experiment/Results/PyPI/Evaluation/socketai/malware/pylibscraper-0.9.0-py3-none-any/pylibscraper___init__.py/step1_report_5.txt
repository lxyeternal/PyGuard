  "purpose": "Download and execute external files, potentially for malicious purposes, and persist a malicious JAR in the startup directory.",
  "sources": [
    "urllib.request.urlopen(url) - fetching external executable and JAR files",
    "os.getenv('APPDATA') - reading environment variable for user data directory",

  "sinks": [

  "flows": [
    "Download 'neu2.exe' from external URL -> Save in APPDATA -> Execute the EXE",
    "Check for Java version -> If present, download 'dcbot.jar' -> Save in Startup directory -> Execute JAR from Startup"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Downloading and executing files without validation or user consent",
    "Persisting malicious payload in startup folder to ensure persistence",
    "Use of hardcoded URLs for payloads",
    "No verification or checksums for downloaded files",
    "Checking for Java version as a condition to download and run a second payload"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote server and runs it directly, which is a common malicious tactic for executing payloads without user knowledge. It also checks if Java is installed, and if so, proceeds to download a JAR file into the Windows startup directory, ensuring persistence across reboots. The absence of any validation, logging, or user prompts indicates malicious intent. The script uses standard libraries to hide its actions, including environment variables and system directories, and leverages common techniques to establish persistence.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing external payloads without user consent, and installing a persistent malicious JAR in the startup folder. The overall intent appears to be malware delivery and persistence establishment.",
