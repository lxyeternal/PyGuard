  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pepmc' package, including some background code that attempts to run a hidden PowerShell command.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('tahg') check, subprocess.Popen call with encoded PowerShell command, package metadata in setup()",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executes a PowerShell command potentially with encoded payload",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' directory -> executes encoded PowerShell command if not exists -> setup() call for package installation",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess without clear purpose, the command is obfuscated, and the use of try/except without handling errors",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup from distutils and attempts to run a background PowerShell process with an encoded command if the 'tahg' directory does not exist. The encoded command is obfuscated and potentially malicious. The setup() function is called with package metadata, which appears normal, but the background process is suspicious, as it runs silently and is encoded. The try/except blocks suppress errors, preventing detection of failures. Overall, the key concern is the encoded PowerShell command that may perform malicious actions, especially since it runs silently and without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains an obfuscated PowerShell command executed in the background, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The setup metadata appears normal, but the hidden process raises security concerns. The overall risk is moderate due to the concealed nature of the PowerShell command.",
