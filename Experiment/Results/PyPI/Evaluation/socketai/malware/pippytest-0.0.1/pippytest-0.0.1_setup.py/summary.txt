  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior—downloading, executing, and deleting external binaries from untrusted sources—indicating high probability of malware. The activity is straightforward and not obfuscated. The overall security risk is extremely high. The scores should be set to malware: 1, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 1."
