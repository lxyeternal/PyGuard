{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a setup script for a Python package, with additional behavior that downloads, saves, and executes potentially malicious executable files from external URLs.",
  "sources": "URL requests for 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/.../ZYXMN.exe' and 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/.../ZYRBX.exe'; file removal commands; environment variables for directory paths",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded files via os.startfile; writing files to system directories; removal of files and directories; dynamic code execution indirectly through executing downloaded files",
  "flows": "Requests fetch executable content -> Files are written to specific directory -> Files are renamed and executed -> Directory is removed",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and executing executables from external Discord CDN URLs; creating directories in system root; removing files and directories without clear purpose; use of os.system for package installation fallback; presence of potentially malicious executable downloads",
  "analysis": "The script begins as a typical setup.py, but then proceeds to download two executable files from suspicious URLs hosted on Discord's CDN. It saves and renames these files into a system directory (C:\\$Windows.~SXK). It then executes these files with os.startfile, which can run arbitrary code, likely malicious. The script also attempts to remove the downloaded files and the directory after execution. The presence of hardcoded URLs pointing to executable files and the process of executing them without validation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The initial setup code is benign, but the subsequent code's behavior is highly suspicious and consistent with malware activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by downloading, saving, and executing external executable files from suspicious URLs, likely leading to malware infection. The setup portion appears normal, but the latter part introduces serious security risks.",
