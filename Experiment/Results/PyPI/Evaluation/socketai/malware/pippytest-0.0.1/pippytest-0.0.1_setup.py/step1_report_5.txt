{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package but also contains functionality that downloads and executes files from external URLs, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from URLs (https://cdn.discordapp.com/.../ZYXMN.exe and ZYRBX.exe) via requests.get, and from environment (filesystem operations).",
  "sinks": "Files are written to the filesystem in a suspicious directory (C:\\$Windows.~SXK). Executable files are then executed via os.startfile, which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Requests to URLs (sources) download content, which is saved as executable files, then renamed and executed (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URL links pointing to executable files, creation of a hidden directory (C:\\$Windows.~SXK), deleting previous files, and executing downloaded files are suspicious activities indicative of malware behavior. The code also attempts to install missing modules dynamically and manipulates system files and directories in a potentially malicious manner.",
  "analysis": "The script begins as a typical setup.py script but then proceeds to download executables from external sources and execute them, which is highly unusual and suspicious for a package setup. It creates a hidden directory in a Windows system directory, downloads payloads, replaces existing files, and executes them without user consent. These actions strongly suggest malicious intent, such as installing backdoors or malware. No legitimate package setup logic or security measures are present. The code does not sanitize URLs or verify downloads, increasing risk. The approach resembles typical malware techniques to persist and execute malicious payloads covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by downloading and executing external payloads, hiding files, and modifying system directories, indicating a high likelihood of malware. It should be considered dangerous and not used.",
