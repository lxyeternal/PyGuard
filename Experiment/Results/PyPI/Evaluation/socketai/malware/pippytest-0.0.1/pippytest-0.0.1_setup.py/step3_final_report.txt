{
  "purpose": "The code downloads two executable files from Discord CDN URLs, saves them into a system-like directory, executes them without validation, and then deletes the files and directory. It also includes setup configuration with suspicious keywords and attempts to install modules silently, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs for executable files, reading/writing files, directory creation, and module import statements.",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded files via os.startfile, deletion of files and directories, and silent installation of modules.",
  "flows": "Requests.get from URLs -> Save files -> Rename and move files into system directory -> Execute files -> Delete files and directory.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and executing external binaries from untrusted sources, creating system-like directories, silent module installation, and use of suspicious keywords ('hack').",
  "analysis": "The code performs actions characteristic of malware: it downloads executables from Discord CDN URLs, saves them into a system-like directory, executes them without validation, and cleans up traces. The setup configuration includes suspicious keywords, and the code attempts silent installation of modules. The behavior is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the malicious intent is clear. The scores assigned in the reports (near 1 for malware and security risk) are justified by these actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior—downloading, executing, and deleting external binaries from untrusted sources—indicating high probability of malware. The activity is straightforward and not obfuscated. The overall security risk is extremely high. The scores should be set to malware: 1, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 1.",
