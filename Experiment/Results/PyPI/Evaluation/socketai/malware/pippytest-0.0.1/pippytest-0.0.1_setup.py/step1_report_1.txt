{
  "purpose": "This script appears to be designed for package setup with additional malicious activity, specifically downloading and executing remote files from Discord URLs, potentially as part of a malware or backdoor delivery mechanism.",
  "sources": "Requests to URLs (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/.../ZYXMN.exe and ZYRBX.exe), reading environment variables, and file system operations (os.remove, os.mkdir).",
  "sinks": "Writing to disk (the downloaded executables), executing downloaded files via os.startfile, and removing files/directories from the system.",
  "flows": "The code downloads files from specified URLs, saves them to disk, renames and executes them immediately, then attempts to delete the files and the directory, creating a source-to-sink flow that involves remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads executable files from Discord URLs, renames them to system-like paths, executes them without user consent, and deletes traces—behaviors typical of malware. Also, the setup function includes a 'keywords' entry with 'hack,' which is suspicious. The code attempts to install missing modules automatically, which could be used to ensure malicious modules are present.",
  "analysis": "The script begins as a setup script for a Python package, with standard package configuration and dependency management. However, it contains embedded malicious behavior: it creates a directory in a system path, downloads executable files from external sources, renames and executes them, then deletes the files and directory, likely to hide malicious activity. These actions resemble malware delivery, potentially backdooring the system. The code does not sanitize or validate downloaded content and executes it directly, which is dangerous. The use of Discord URLs and automatic installation of modules further suggests an intent to maintain persistence or infect systems surreptitiously.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits high malicious intent, primarily through its downloading and execution of external executables, which is characteristic of malware. Its obfuscation is minimal but the behavior itself is suspicious and dangerous. It should not be used or distributed. The overall security risk is extremely high.",
