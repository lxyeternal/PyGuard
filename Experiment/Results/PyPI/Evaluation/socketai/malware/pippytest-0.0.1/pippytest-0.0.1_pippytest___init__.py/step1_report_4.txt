  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two straightforward functions for addition and subtraction without any external data reading, network operations, or side effects. The functions perform basic arithmetic on their inputs and return the result. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple utility functions performing basic arithmetic with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
