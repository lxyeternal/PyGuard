  "sinks": "No data output or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, no data flow or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two straightforward functions performing basic arithmetic operations. There are no external data sources, no untrusted inputs, and no potential sinks for data leaks or malicious actions. The functions are simple and do not contain any obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears benign and intended solely for computational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior detected. It simply provides basic addition and subtraction functions without any external interactions or vulnerabilities.",
