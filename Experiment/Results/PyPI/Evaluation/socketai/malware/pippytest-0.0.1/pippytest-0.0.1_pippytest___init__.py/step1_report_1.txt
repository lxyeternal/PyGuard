  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns present",
  "analysis": "The code defines two straightforward functions for addition and subtraction. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, external data sources, or obfuscated constructs. The functions perform simple arithmetic operations and return the result. No suspicious code flow, data leaks, or external communication is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and implements basic mathematical operations without any malicious intent or security issues.",
