{
  "purpose": "Simple arithmetic functions performing addition and subtraction with no external dependencies or suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'one' and 'two' in add and sub functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting the sum or difference; no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into arithmetic operations, then to return statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two basic functions: add and sub, which perform addition and subtraction respectively. Both functions take parameters and return the result directly. There are no external data sources, no network calls, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns. The code is clear, simple, and benign. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of basic arithmetic functions with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
