  "purpose": "Simple mathematical functions for addition and subtraction",
  "sources": "No input reading or data fetching; functions take parameters only",
  "sinks": "No data output or external system interactions; functions return computed values",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'one' and 'two' flow directly into arithmetic operations and return statements",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; straightforward implementation",
  "analysis": "The code defines two basic functions performing addition and subtraction on input parameters. There are no external data sources, no suspicious code constructs, and no side effects. The code lacks obfuscation or hidden behavior. It is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, harmless implementation of mathematical functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
