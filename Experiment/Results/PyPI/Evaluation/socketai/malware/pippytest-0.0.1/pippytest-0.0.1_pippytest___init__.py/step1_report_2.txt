  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward arithmetic operations without side effects or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines two basic functions for addition and subtraction, accepting parameters and returning their sum or difference. No external input, environment variables, or untrusted data handling is present. No obfuscated code, no malicious patterns, and no suspicious behavior identified.",
