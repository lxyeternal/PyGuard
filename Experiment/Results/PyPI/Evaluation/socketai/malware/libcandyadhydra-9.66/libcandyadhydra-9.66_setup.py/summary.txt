  "conclusion": "The package contains highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell code executed during installation, indicative of potential malicious activity. The pattern aligns with common supply chain attack techniques. Scores are consistent with high suspicion, and further decoding of the command is recommended to confirm malicious intent. Until then, treat this package as potentially malicious and proceed with caution."
