  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious activity, such as remote code execution or system compromise. The silent execution, obfuscation, and suspicious comment support a malicious intent. The package should be considered compromised or malicious until further analysis confirms the payload's nature."
