{
  "purpose": "The script is intended to set up a Python package named 'py-edpip' with specific metadata and package contents.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment state (os.path.exists), potentially reads/writes files, and executes a subprocess command with encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executes a PowerShell command that is encoded and potentially malicious. The code also reads the filesystem, which could be used to conditionally trigger malicious actions.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the script executes a hidden PowerShell command. No other data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a PowerShell command with an encoded payload that runs hidden, and the presence of a comment with suspicious domain 'esquelesquad.rip'. The subprocess command is obfuscated and potentially malicious. The code attempts to run malicious payloads silently upon certain filesystem conditions. The try-except blocks suppress errors, preventing visibility into failures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a setup for a package named 'py-edpip', which appears legitimate. However, it contains a suspicious conditional that checks for a directory 'tahg'. If absent, it runs a PowerShell encoded command silently, which is a common technique to hide malicious activity. The encoded payload likely executes additional malicious or tracking code. The rest of the code is standard setup logic, wrapped in exception handling that suppresses errors. The presence of the encoded command and silent execution indicates an attempt at stealthy malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a potentially malicious payload hidden within an encoded PowerShell command triggered under specific conditions. It appears designed to run concealed malicious code during package installation or execution. Overall, there is a high likelihood of malicious behavior, despite the primary apparent purpose of package setup.",
