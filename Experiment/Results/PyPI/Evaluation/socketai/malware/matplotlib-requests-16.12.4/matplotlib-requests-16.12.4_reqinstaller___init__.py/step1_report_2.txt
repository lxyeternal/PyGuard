  "purpose": "Download an executable from a URL and run it locally.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1109115014054416495/1109465188433936425/Windows.exe' via requests.get()",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call([exe_path]) executes the downloaded file, potentially malicious code.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves the file → saved to temporary location → subprocess.call() executes the file.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically downloads and executes an external executable without validation or user consent. No verification of the executable's integrity or safety. No error handling or security checks. The executable is fetched from a Discord CDN link, which is uncommon for legitimate software distribution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and downloads an executable file from a remote URL using requests. The file is saved temporarily on disk without any validation or integrity checks. Immediately after, the code executes the downloaded file without user approval or sandboxing, which is highly suspicious. The absence of error handling or verification suggests potential malicious intent, especially considering the direct execution of a downloaded binary. The code could be part of a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. The process could lead to system compromise, data theft, or system damage if the executable is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script downloads and executes an external executable without validation, indicating high malicious potential. It exhibits typical malware behavior aimed at executing remote code on the host system without user awareness.",
