      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally with silent error handling, indicative of malicious or backdoor activity. The obfuscation and concealment tactics justify high malware and security risk scores. Further decoding of the command is recommended to confirm payload intent. Overall, the package should be treated as potentially malicious until verified."
