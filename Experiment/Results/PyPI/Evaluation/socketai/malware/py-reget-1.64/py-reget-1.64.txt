      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to the encoded PowerShell payload, suspicious URL, and obfuscation. The behavior aligns with typical malicious package behavior, such as downloading or executing harmful code during installation. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with these indicators."
