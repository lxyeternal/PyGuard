  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the installed scikit-learn library.",
  "sources": "Accessing the __version__ attribute of the sklearn module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Importing sklearn -> accessing sklearn.__version__ -> returning version string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sklearn library, then defines a function to return its version number. It performs a straightforward attribute access with no user input, network activity, or system modifications. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or data flows that could be exploited maliciously. The code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply retrieves and returns the version of the sklearn library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
