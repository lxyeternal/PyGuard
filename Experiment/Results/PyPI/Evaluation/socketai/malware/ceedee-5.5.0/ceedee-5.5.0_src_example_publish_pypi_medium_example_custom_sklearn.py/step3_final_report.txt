  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the sklearn library.",
  "sources": "Import statement for sklearn; access to sklearn.__version__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing the version string; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Import sklearn -> get_sklearn_version() -> return sklearn.__version__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version retrieval with no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sklearn and defines a function that returns its __version__ attribute. It performs a simple, benign operation with no inputs, outputs, or side effects beyond returning a version string. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code is standard for version checking, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and clarity justify these scores. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility to retrieve sklearn's version. All analyses are accurate, and the security risk, malware, and obfuscation scores are appropriately set to 0. There is no malicious intent or security concern.",
