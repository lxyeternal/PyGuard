  "purpose": "Retrieve and return the version number of the installed sklearn library.",
  "sources": "Access to the sklearn.__version__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the version string; no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Access of sklearn.__version__ (source) and returning its value (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward attribute access and return.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sklearn library, defines a function to get its version, and returns that version. It uses standard library attributes and does not perform any input/output beyond returning a string. No suspicious or malicious code, no data leaks, no external network connections, or hidden behaviors. No obfuscated code or complex logic present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, simple, and intended solely to retrieve the sklearn version. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
