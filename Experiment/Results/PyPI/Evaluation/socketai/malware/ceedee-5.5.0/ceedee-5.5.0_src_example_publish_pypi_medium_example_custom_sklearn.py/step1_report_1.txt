  "sinks": "None that directly lead to data leaks or security issues",
  "flows": "Import sklearn -> Access sklearn.__version__ -> Return version string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward version retrieval",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sklearn library and defines a function that returns its version string. There are no inputs from external sources, no data processing beyond attribute access, and no outputs that could leak sensitive information or perform malicious actions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code is simple and standard for checking package version.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard version-checking functionality with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
