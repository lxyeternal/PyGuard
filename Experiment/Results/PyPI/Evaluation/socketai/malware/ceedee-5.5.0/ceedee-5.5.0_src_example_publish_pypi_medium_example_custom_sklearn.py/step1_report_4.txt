  "flows": "Import sklearn -> Access sklearn.__version__ -> Return version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sklearn library, defines a function to return its version, and does not process any untrusted input or perform any malicious actions. It does not contain obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials or dangerous operations. The code is a typical utility function for version checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a simple retrieval of library version, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
