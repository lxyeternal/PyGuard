  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script for performing some form of data processing or network request, but without specific comments or documentation, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from environment variables, function parameters, or external files (not explicitly shown but typical in such scripts).",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive operations like network connections, file writing, or executing commands (specific sinks are not explicitly identified in the provided snippet).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., environment variables or user input) through processing functions to sinks such as network or file system.",
  "anomalies": "No overt anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow are detected in the provided code snippet. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks explicit hardcoded secrets or obfuscated segments. It uses standard Python constructs, with no signs of malicious code injection or suspicious behaviors. There are no evident network connections to suspicious domains, no dynamic execution, and no data exfiltration mechanisms visible. The overall structure suggests a benign utility script, though limited context prevents a definitive conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. However, due to limited context, a low confidence score is assigned.",
  "confidence": 0.3,
  "obfuscated": 0,
