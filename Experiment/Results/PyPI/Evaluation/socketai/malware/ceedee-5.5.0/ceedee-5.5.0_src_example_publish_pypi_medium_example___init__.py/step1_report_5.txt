  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, likely intended for general execution or a specific utility function. No explicit purpose is evident from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown; the code does not read from files, network, environment variables, or user input within the provided segment.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks such as network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration points are evident in the snippet.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flow is observable, as no input or output operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures are detected. The code structure appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "A step-by-step review shows no signs of malicious intent. The code uses typical Python syntax and constructs without unusual or obfuscated features. There are no network operations, no credential handling, and no data leaks visible. The lack of input and output operations suggests no immediate threat. The overall structure is clear, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities within the scope of this review.",
