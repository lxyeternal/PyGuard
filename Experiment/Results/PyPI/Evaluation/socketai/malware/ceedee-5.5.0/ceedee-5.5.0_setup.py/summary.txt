  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious and potentially malicious behavior through unconsented collection and exfiltration of sensitive system data, including /etc/passwd, during module import. The external transmission of this data without user awareness indicates malicious intent. The scores in the reports are justified, with the highest (1) for malware and security risk reflecting the severity of the behavior."
