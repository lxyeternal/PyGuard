      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity or backdoor behavior. The obfuscation, hidden execution, and error suppression collectively justify high malware and security risk scores. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm its purpose. Until then, this package should be considered potentially malicious and handled with extreme caution."
