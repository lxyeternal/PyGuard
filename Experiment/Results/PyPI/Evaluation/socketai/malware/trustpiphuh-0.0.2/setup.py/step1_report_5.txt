  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to run a command during package installation",
  "sources": "The subprocess.run call within the run method of TotallyInnocentClass during installation",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run command executes an external command that fetches data from a remote server and executes it with Perl",
  "flows": "The run method is invoked during installation; it executes a remote curl command piped into Perl, which could execute arbitrary code",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.run with shell=True and executing a network fetch and Perl script during package install; suspicious as it occurs automatically during setup",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, when run, executes a subprocess command. The command retrieves data from an external IP address over HTTP and pipes it into Perl for execution. This is a clear malicious behavior pattern designed to execute remote code during package installation. The rest of the setup code appears normal and standard, but the critical concern is the subprocess call which is executed automatically during install, indicating malicious intent or backdoor behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a malicious backdoor that fetches and executes remote code during installation, representing a high security risk. The presence of remote code execution during setup is suspicious and dangerous.",
