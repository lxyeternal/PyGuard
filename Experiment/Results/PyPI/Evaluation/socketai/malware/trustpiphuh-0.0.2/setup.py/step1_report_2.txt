{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup script for a Python package, which executes a network request during installation.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.run command within the run method of the TotallyInnocentClass class, which executes a shell command to fetch and run a script from a remote server.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run command acts as a sink, executing remote code fetched over the network, which could lead to remote code execution on the host system.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves the setup process invoking the run method of TotallyInnocentClass during installation, which executes an external command via subprocess, fetching and executing remote content.",
  "anomalies": "The run method executes a shell command that retrieves and executes a script from a suspicious IP address, which is highly unusual and indicative of malicious intent. The class name 'TotallyInnocentClass' is misleading.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install command in setuptools to run a subprocess command during installation. The subprocess command fetches content from an external IP address and executes it via Perl, which is a typical indicator of malicious behavior or backdoor setup. The code does not sanitize or verify remote content, and running such code can compromise system security. The code structure is straightforward, but the behavior is suspicious and dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a malicious payload designed to download and execute remote code during package installation. The remote script could perform any malicious activity, such as data theft, system compromise, or establishing a backdoor. The package should be considered malicious and unsafe to install.",
