  "purpose": "Detects malicious PowerShell execution during setup, indicating potential supply chain attack.",
  "sources": "The check for 'tahg' directory; the subprocess call executing the encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of encoded PowerShell command in a hidden window, potentially downloading or executing malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' -> conditional execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command with -EncodedCommand flag, hidden window flags, silent error handling, suspicious URL in comment.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory; if absent, executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command in a hidden window, which is suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. The command's obfuscation and external URL suggest malicious payload delivery. Error suppression conceals failures. The pattern aligns with common malware tactics for covert execution during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains embedded malicious activity through obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during setup. The suspicious URL and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent, making this package highly dangerous and potentially malicious.",
