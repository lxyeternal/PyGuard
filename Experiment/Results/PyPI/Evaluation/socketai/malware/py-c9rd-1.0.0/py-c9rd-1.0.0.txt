      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to encrypted payload decryption and dynamic execution during installation on Windows. The hardcoded encryption key and ciphertext, combined with the use of exec(), strongly suggest malicious activity such as backdoor deployment or malware execution. The assigned high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified. It is recommended to treat this package as malicious and avoid its use until further analysis is conducted."
