{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'py-c9rd' with a custom installation process that includes potentially malicious decryption and execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, performs a decryption operation with Fernet, and executes the decrypted code using exec().",
  "sinks": "exec() of decrypted code, import of 'requests' and 'fernet', which could be used maliciously if the decrypted code is harmful.",
  "flows": "During installation, if OS is Windows, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypts a string with Fernet, and executes the decrypted code via exec(), which could be malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted data and an exec() call on decrypted code, which is often used to hide malicious payloads. The code decrypts and executes data without validation. The long strings of seemingly random characters suggest obfuscation. The custom install class performs decryption and execution during installation, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command 'GruppeInstall' that, on Windows, imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts an embedded string using Fernet symmetric encryption, and executes the decrypted content via exec(). The encrypted data appears intentionally obfuscated. This pattern is characteristic of malicious code attempting to hide payloads. The code's purpose seems to be to run arbitrary code during package installation, which poses a security risk. The presence of hardcoded encrypted strings and dynamic execution indicates malicious intent and obfuscation. No other suspicious or malicious behavior is evident outside of this encrypted execution mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated and suspicious behavior, notably the decryption and execution of hidden code during installation. This pattern is indicative of potential malicious intent or backdoor functionality. Due to the use of encryption, exec(), and obfuscated strings, the overall risk is high. It warrants caution and further investigation before use.",
