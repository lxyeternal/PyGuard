{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'py-c9rd' Python package, including a custom install command that executes decrypted code if on Windows.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports external libraries ('requests' and 'fernet'), and decrypts and executes code via Fernet inside the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code using exec() within the custom install class, which could execute malicious code if the decryption key or encrypted payload is malicious.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the script imports requests and Fernet, decrypts an encrypted string, and executes the resulting code. The decryption key is hardcoded, and the code is run dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded encryption key, use of exec() on decrypted payload, and conditional code execution only on Windows. The encrypted payload's purpose is unclear, and the code potentially runs arbitrary code during installation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks but includes a malicious pattern: on Windows, it decrypts a string with a hardcoded key and executes it dynamically via exec(). The decrypted code could contain any instructions, posing a significant security risk. The use of Fernet for decrypting code that is then executed indicates an obfuscated or concealed malicious payload, especially given the lack of transparency about what the payload does. The presence of hardcoded keys and dynamic code execution during installation are suspicious and typical indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-risk pattern where an encrypted payload is decrypted and executed during installation on Windows. This behavior is indicative of potential malware or malicious backdoor. The hardcoded key and dynamic execution significantly increase security concerns. Overall, this package should be considered malicious or compromised.",
