{
  "purpose": "This setup script installs a Python package named 'py-c9rd' and includes a custom installation step that executes decrypted code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports modules ('os', 'requests', 'fernet'), and executes decrypted code via 'exec()' in the 'run' method of 'GruppeInstall'.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec()' function executes decrypted code that is dynamically loaded during installation, potentially allowing malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "The script decrypts a hardcoded string using Fernet, then executes the resulting code at install time on Windows systems, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded encrypted data and the use of 'exec()' to run decrypted code are suspicious. The code decrypts and executes code during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and a custom install command. Within the 'run' method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' (from 'cryptography') on Windows ('nt'). It decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string using a base64-encoded key and executes the resulting code dynamically via 'exec()'. This behavior allows execution of arbitrary code during package installation, which could be malicious if the encrypted payload is malicious. The use of 'exec()' with decrypted data is a common tactic for hiding malicious code. The script does not validate or sandbox the decrypted code, and the encrypted string appears intentionally obfuscated, suggesting malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism that decrypts and executes arbitrary code during installation on Windows systems. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent, such as executing malicious payloads or establishing backdoors. The package should be considered unsafe due to this behavior.",
