  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, functioning as a remote backdoor that exfiltrates files, executes arbitrary commands, and maintains persistent control over the host system during package installation. The assigned scores of malware: 1 and securityRisk: 1 are appropriate and justified. The code should be flagged as malicious, and the package should not be used or distributed."
