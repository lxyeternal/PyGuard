      "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, functioning as a remote backdoor that exfiltrates files, executes arbitrary commands, and maintains persistent control over the host system during package installation. The assigned scores of malware: 1 and securityRisk: 1 are appropriate and justified. The code should be flagged as malicious, and the package should not be used or distributed."

Report 1 shows moderate to high suspicion justified by obfuscation and suspicious patterns, warranting a malware score of 0.6 and risk of 0.65. Benign reports correctly have zero or minimal scores. Overall, the scoring accurately reflects the assessed security posture."
