  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a general Python script that may perform various tasks depending on context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, user input, and potentially external files or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Data may be written to log files, sent over network connections, or stored in local variables; some outputs may be vulnerable if untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, user input) through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks such as network transmission or file output.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. No suspicious dynamic code execution or unusual variable names detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables and user input, processes data through functions, and may send data over network or write to files. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy leaks observed. Usage of third-party libraries is standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity detected. The structure is clear, with no obfuscated segments or unusual language features. The code appears legitimate and intended for standard processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The code performs typical data processing without suspicious actions. Confidence in this assessment is high, and there are no indicators of obfuscation or malware presence.",
