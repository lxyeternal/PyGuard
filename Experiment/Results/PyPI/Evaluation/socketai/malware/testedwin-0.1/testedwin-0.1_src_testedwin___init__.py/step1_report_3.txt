  "purpose": "Unknown, as no code was provided to determine its intended function.",
  "sources": "No sources identified due to absence of code; typically would include input functions, environment variable reads, network calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; normally would include system commands, file writes, network transmissions.",
  "flows": "No data flows can be traced without code; generally source-to-sink paths involve untrusted input leading to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected due to lack of code; cannot identify hardcoded secrets, obfuscated sections, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided input is empty; thus, no code structure, functions, or logic can be analyzed. Without code, it's impossible to identify sources, sinks, data flows, or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "No code provided for review. Cannot assess for malicious behavior or security risks. Please supply the code snippet for a thorough analysis.",
