  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign or lack sufficient evidence of malicious activity. Report 1 shows features that suggest moderate suspicion but no confirmed malicious payloads. The scores are generally appropriate; minor adjustments could better reflect the suspicion if features like exec/eval are confirmed. Overall, the code appears safe unless further evidence indicates malicious intent."
