  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints 'Hello, World!'.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static code with no data reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only outputs to the console without handling untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function executes a print statement directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function 'hello()' that prints a static greeting. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no external data, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and justified. The code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies or data flows confirm its harmlessness. No logical errors or vulnerabilities are present. The high confidence score (1) reflects certainty about its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
