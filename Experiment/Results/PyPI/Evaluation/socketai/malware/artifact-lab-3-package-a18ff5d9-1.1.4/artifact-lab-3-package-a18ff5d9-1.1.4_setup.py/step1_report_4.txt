  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that runs additional functions during installation and development.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables with os.environ; executing notmalfunc() at the end of the script.",
  "sinks": "Sending encoded environment data via an HTTP POST request to an external URL (ngrok endpoint).",
  "flows": "Environment variables are encoded and sent to the remote URL during installation or development; also called explicitly at script's end.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending all environment variables to an external server, which is not typical for setup scripts. The function name 'notmalfunc' is misspelled, but this is minor.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function 'notmalfunc' that collects all environment variables, encodes them, and sends them via POST request to a specified URL. This function is invoked during the package's setup process (both at the end of the script and during custom develop/install commands). The external URL appears to be an ngrok tunnel, potentially indicating data exfiltration or testing behavior. No other malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated sections are present. The code could leak sensitive environment data during installation or development, which is a security concern.\n\nGiven the behavior of sending environment data to an external server during package setup, this pattern is suspicious and could be malicious if used without user knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects and transmits environment variables to an external URL during package installation and development, which is abnormal and potentially malicious behavior. This could lead to data leakage or privacy violations, especially if sensitive environment variables are involved.",
