{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates all environment variables to an external URL during package setup and import, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reading all environment variables via os.environ",
  "sinks": "Sending URL-encoded data via HTTP POST request to https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app",
  "flows": "Environment variables are collected, encoded, and transmitted immediately upon import and during install/develop commands",
  "anomalies": "Repeated calls to notmalfunc() at import and during setup, use of suspicious ngrok URL, no validation or user consent, function name misspelling",
  "analysis": "The script collects all environment variables and exfiltrates them to an external server during import and setup phases, with no validation or user consent. The use of an ngrok URL suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The repeated calls increase the volume of data sent, heightening privacy concerns. The straightforward code indicates malicious intent focused on data theft, with no obfuscation or other malicious payloads present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious due to environment data exfiltration during package setup and import. The use of a temporary ngrok endpoint and repeated data transmission strongly indicates malicious intent, warranting a high malware and security risk score.",
