{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools and includes hooks to run a function that sends environment data to a remote server during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The function 'notmalfunc()' reads environment variables via 'os.environ'. It is called at the global scope and during post-install and post-develop hooks.",
  "sinks": "The environment data is URL-encoded and sent via an HTTP POST request to an external server ('https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app').",
  "flows": "Environment variables are collected at the source, encoded, and then transmitted over the network to the specified URL during package installation or development setup.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending all environment variables to an external server without user consent, multiple calls to 'notmalfunc()', and the use of an ngrok URL which is often temporary and suspicious. The function name 'notmalfunc' is nonspecific and potentially obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools components for packaging, then defines 'notmalfunc()', which gathers environment variables and sends them via a POST request to a remote URL. This function is invoked immediately at the script's end and during post-install/develop phases, meaning it executes both during setup and runtime. The URL used is an ngrok URL, which can be temporary and suspicious. The code's behavior of transmitting environment data without explicit user consent indicates potentially malicious or at least privacy-invasive behavior. There is no indication of malicious payloads like system damage, data theft beyond environment info, or backdoors, but the data exfiltration pattern is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by secretly sending environment data to an external server during package installation and development. This could be used for malicious tracking or data collection. No overt malware like system damage is present, but the privacy violation is significant.",
