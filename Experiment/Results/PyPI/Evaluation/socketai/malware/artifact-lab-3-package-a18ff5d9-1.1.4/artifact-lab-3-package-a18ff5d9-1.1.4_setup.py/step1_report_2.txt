{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package with custom install and develop commands that execute a function to send environment data to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables from os.environ",
  "sinks": "Sending encoded environment data via HTTP POST request to an external URL (https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app)",
  "flows": "os.environ -> urllib.parse.urlencode -> urllib.request.Request -> URL endpoint",
  "anomalies": "The function 'notmalfunc' is invoked at the global scope, causing data transmission upon module import. The URL is an ngrok address, potentially dynamic and suspicious. No authentication or validation is present for the data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines functions and classes that extend install and develop commands. The 'notmalfunc' function collects environment variables and sends them to an external URL. This function is called immediately after class definitions and again at the script's end, causing repeated data exfiltration. The URL appears to be a public tunneling service, which could be used maliciously to exfiltrate sensitive data. No explicit malicious code like system modifications or data theft beyond environment variable transmission is present, but the act of exfiltrating environment data without user consent is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to exfiltrate environment variables to an external server during package installation or development setup, which could be malicious or violate privacy expectations. The use of an ngrok URL suggests potential malicious intent, especially since it runs automatically upon import and setup. This behavior warrants suspicion and further review before use.",
