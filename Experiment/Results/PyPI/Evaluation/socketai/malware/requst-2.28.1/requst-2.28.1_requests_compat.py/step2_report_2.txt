  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports describe the code as a standard compatibility module for handling imports and version differences between Python 2 and 3. They consistently state that the code performs no data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The code is purely for compatibility and import handling, with no evidence of malicious activity, data leaks, or vulnerabilities. The import statements and logic are standard, and no untrusted data flows are evident.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No flaws or errors are apparent in the reasoning. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, and the code matches the described behavior.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign a risk score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code does not introduce any security risk.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code does not handle untrusted data or perform any network or file operations that could be exploited.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard compatibility shim with no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no security risks. It handles imports and version detection in a typical manner, with no signs of malicious payloads or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
