{
  "purpose": "This code handles import compatibility issues between Python 2 and Python 3, manages optional dependencies like chardet and simplejson, and sets up version flags and type aliases for backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json, collections, http, io, urllib, and sys.version_info for version detection.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or produce external outputs.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves conditional imports and setting version flags, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, standard compatibility boilerplate with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility module that conditionally imports modules based on availability, detects Python version, and defines type aliases. It contains no network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The import fallback for chardet and optional simplejson import are standard practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is solely to ensure compatibility across Python versions, and it does not handle untrusted data or perform any risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility shim with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
