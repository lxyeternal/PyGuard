{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility and import handling for different Python versions and dependencies, specifically targeting older Python versions and optional libraries like chardet and simplejson.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (sys, collections, http, io, urllib), optional libraries (chardet, simplejson), and version info from sys.",
  "sinks": "No significant sinks; only standard library imports and variable assignments. No untrusted data handling or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing dependencies and setting up compatibility variables, with no data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code follows standard compatibility handling practices.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up compatibility for different Python versions, imports optional modules with fallbacks, and defines some type aliases. It does not perform any network operations, data processing, or user input handling. The imports and variable definitions are all standard and do not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be boilerplate for compatibility purposes, with no malicious intent or malicious payloads identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for compatibility and dependency handling without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and contains no indicators of malware or security threats.",
