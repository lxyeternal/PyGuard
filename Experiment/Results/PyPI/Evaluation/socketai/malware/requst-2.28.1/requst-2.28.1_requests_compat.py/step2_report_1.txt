  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily about compatibility handling: importing modules conditionally, setting version flags, and defining type aliases.\n- No network operations, data processing, or user input handling are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The modules imported are standard or widely used third-party libraries, with fallbacks implemented safely.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity or contain malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly describes compatibility and dependency handling.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No untrusted data or external outputs.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Accurate; code is boilerplate for compatibility, safe, and benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing utility functions and compatibility.\n- Same conclusions: no suspicious behavior, no malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Again, a standard compatibility module.\n- No data leaks, suspicious code, or malicious patterns.\n- Scores: all zero for malware, obfuscated, risk.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Describes standard import resolution and compatibility handling.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores: zero for malware, obfuscated, risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar to others, describing compatibility setup.\n- No suspicious patterns.\n- Scores: all zero.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely for compatibility and import management.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** No malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions or misinterpretations; the code does not process untrusted data or perform risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code is standard compatibility boilerplate.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical, well-structured compatibility module with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
