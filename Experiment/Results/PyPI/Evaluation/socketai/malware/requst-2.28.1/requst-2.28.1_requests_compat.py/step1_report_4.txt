{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility shims for different Python versions and handles imports for various utilities such as JSON parsing, URL handling, and cookies.",
  "sources": "Code reads import statements, version info from sys, and conditional imports of modules like chardet, simplejson, and various urllib components.",
  "sinks": "Imports are static and do not involve untrusted data. No user input or external data is processed in a way that could lead to injection or leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code primarily sets up environment compatibility and import configurations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, mainly import resolution and compatibility handling. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated sections are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard environment detection and import resolution. It includes fallback mechanisms for optional dependencies (e.g., chardet, simplejson). The use of sys.version_info for Python version detection is typical. No dynamic execution, network access, or user input handling occurs. The code is well-structured and aligns with typical compatibility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility shim for Python 2 and 3. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
