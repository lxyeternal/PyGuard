{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility handling for different Python versions and imports necessary modules for HTTP requests, JSON parsing, and data structures. It is part of a compatibility or utility module used in larger projects.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json, collections, http.cookies, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request, and sys to gather environment and compatibility data.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data is processed or exposed; the code primarily sets up imports and compatibility aliases.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules based on availability, sets version flags, and defines some type aliases. No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code avoids dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. It performs standard compatibility handling and module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version and imports different modules accordingly, handles optional imports such as simplejson, and sets up compatibility aliases. All operations are standard and serve the purpose of maintaining cross-version compatibility. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward compatibility and import utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly handles imports and version checks, with no data leaks or harmful actions.",
