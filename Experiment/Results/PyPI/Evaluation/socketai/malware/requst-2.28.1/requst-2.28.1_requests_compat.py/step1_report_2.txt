{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and utility functions for HTTP requests, encoding, and Python version differences in the requests.compat module.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, third-party modules (chardet, simplejson), and system information (sys).",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; no external network or file writing operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily initializes imports and assigns variables; no data flow from sources to sinks indicative of malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward compatibility module that imports standard and third-party libraries, manages import fallbacks, and defines basic compatibility variables. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or execute dynamic code. The import of chardet and simplejson is conditional but safe, serving compatibility purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The structure and content align with standard compatibility practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility module with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions solely to provide compatibility across Python versions and handle library fallbacks.",
