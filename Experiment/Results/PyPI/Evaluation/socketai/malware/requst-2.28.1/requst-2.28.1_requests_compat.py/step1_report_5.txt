{
  "purpose": "This module handles compatibility issues between Python 2 and Python 3, and manages imports for various modules like 'chardet', 'json', and URL handling utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries and third-party modules such as 'chardet', 'simplejson', 'json', 'collections', 'http', 'io', and 'urllib'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code mainly performs import resolution and compatibility adjustments without processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, handling conditional imports, and defining compatibility variables. No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs. The code performs standard compatibility and import management tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility and import resolution module. It conditionally imports 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', handles optional 'simplejson', and defines version-specific variables. All operations are standard for ensuring cross-version compatibility. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is detected. The code does not process untrusted data or perform any network operations.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be a typical utility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility utility with no malicious behavior, security issues, or suspicious anomalies. It primarily manages imports and compatibility flags for different Python versions and libraries.",
