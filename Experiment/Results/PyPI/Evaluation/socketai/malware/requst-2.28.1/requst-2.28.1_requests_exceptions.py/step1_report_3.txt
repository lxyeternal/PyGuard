{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various error conditions in the Requests library, including connection issues, HTTP errors, JSON decoding errors, and warnings.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and internal compatibility module for JSONDecodeError.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception classes are for error handling only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward exception class definitions with standard initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports external exception classes and defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions related to HTTP requests. All classes are standard and inherit from built-in or third-party exceptions. The __init__ methods perform standard initialization without executing any external commands, network calls, or handling untrusted input. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic are present. No potential malicious behaviors or anomalies are evident. The code is well-structured and appears to be a typical exception handling module for the Requests library.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines exception classes for error handling in an HTTP request context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation for a Python HTTP library.",
