  "purpose": "Defines a set of exception and warning classes for the Requests library to handle various request errors and warnings.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and a local compat module; class constructors accessing response and request attributes.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted input handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard exception hierarchy for the Requests library, with constructors properly initializing attributes and calling superclass constructors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code contains no network activity, untrusted data processing, or secrets. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign set of exception and warning class definitions for the Requests library. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk present. The reports accurately assess the code as safe, and the scores are justified.",
