{
  "purpose": "Define and handle various exceptions related to HTTP requests, including connection issues, decoding errors, and invalid URLs, primarily for the requests library.",
  "sources": "Exception class initializations, attribute accesses (e.g., response.request), and imports from external modules.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__(*args, **kwargs) calls in exception constructors, attribute assignments to self.response and self.request, and calls to external library exceptions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from exception instantiation (e.g., in constructors), through attribute assignments, and into super() calls which may process or propagate exception data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code primarily defines exception classes and handles standard error conditions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for various request-related exceptions. It imports exceptions from urllib3 and compat modules, then defines custom exception classes with constructors that handle optional response and request objects. These classes serve as structured error indicators for HTTP, JSON, SSL, timeout, and other request errors. No untrusted data input, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code does not perform any network requests, data processing, or system modifications. All behaviors are consistent with standard exception handling in Python modules. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines exception classes for a requests library, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations independently, or contain any hidden or harmful code. The overall security risk is negligible.",
