  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling various errors and warnings in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements: urllib3.exceptions, .compat module; exception instantiations and attribute access within class constructors.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; code does not process untrusted input or perform sensitive actions based on input.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and attribute setting occur within class constructors, which are called during error handling scenarios.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code solely defines exception classes and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of custom exception and warning class definitions for the Requests library, extending built-in Python exceptions and incorporating some third-party exceptions. It includes constructor methods that properly initialize base classes and set attributes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The import statements are straightforward, and no dynamic code execution or suspicious data handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides structured exception handling for the Requests library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of error classes.",
