  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of their assessments and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes for Requests; no anomalies or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that this code is purely for defining exception classes. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; exception class definitions with no anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is standard exception class definitions. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; exception hierarchy, no anomalies or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous findings. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes, no malicious activity, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code remains standard exception class definitions. The assessment and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard exception classes, no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code in all reports is the same, standard exception class definitions for the Requests library.\n- **Malware:** No signs of malicious code, such as code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code, encrypted strings, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Security risk:** The code is purely structural, used for error handling, with no evident security risks.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0.0** across all reports.\n- The **obfuscated score** should be **0.0**.\n- The **risk score** should be **0.0** since there is no indication of security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0.0** | **0.0** | **0.0** |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, legitimate set of exception classes for the Requests library, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and no security risks. The current scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
