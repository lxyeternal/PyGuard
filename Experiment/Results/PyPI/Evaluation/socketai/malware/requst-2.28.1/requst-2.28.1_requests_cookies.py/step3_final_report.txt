  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for cookie management, including extraction, creation, merging, and compatibility wrappers for requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Request headers, response headers, request object attributes, cookie parameters.",
  "sinks": "CookieJar storage, header generation, cookie extraction, cookie removal.",
  "flows": "Request headers are read for cookies; cookies are extracted into CookieJar; cookies are merged or removed; headers are generated for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard threading and pickle support.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard cookie handling utilities with clear, well-structured functions and classes. No signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation are present. The use of threading locks and mock objects aligns with typical thread-safe and testing practices. The linear search operations are performance considerations but do not indicate security issues. The code operates within expected parameters for cookie management in the requests library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard implementation of cookie utilities for the requests library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
