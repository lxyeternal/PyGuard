  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies in the requests library, including cookie extraction, management, and conversion functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from HTTP response headers, request URLs, headers, and cookie parameters such as name, value, domain, and path.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include cookie setting and extraction functions, especially in 'extract_cookies_to_jar', 'get_cookie_header', and 'set_cookie'. These manipulate cookie data and headers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from response headers into cookie jar via 'extract_cookies_to_jar', and cookie data can be retrieved or set via 'get_cookie_header', 'set', and 'set_cookie'. Cookies are created with user-supplied parameters and stored in cookie jars.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. The code includes standard cookie handling logic, with no obfuscated or suspicious features. The use of threading and copying appears typical. No network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements cookie handling functionalities: extracting cookies from responses, converting cookies from Morsel objects, managing cookie jars, and creating or removing cookies. It uses standard Python libraries and patterns for managing cookies, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The functions for extracting and setting cookies operate solely on cookie data and HTTP headers. No suspicious or hidden operations are present. The code is structured and appears to be part of a legitimate library for cookie compatibility in requests.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cookie management utilities for the requests library. It contains no malicious, sabotage, or malware behavior. All operations involve handling cookies and headers in a normal, expected manner. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration.",
