{
  "purpose": "Outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The call to certifi.where() which retrieves the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "The printed output displaying the CA bundle path; no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The script calls where() and prints its result; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; straightforward use of a trusted library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted function and prints its output without processing untrusted input or performing network operations. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent and appropriate given the simplicity and trustworthiness of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that outputs the CA bundle path. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concern. The code is safe and appropriate for use in security-sensitive environments, with scores reflecting its harmless nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
