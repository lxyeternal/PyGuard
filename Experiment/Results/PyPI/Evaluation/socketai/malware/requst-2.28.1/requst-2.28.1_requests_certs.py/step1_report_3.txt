  "purpose": "This module provides the default CA certificate bundle location using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location via 'where()' from the certifi package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "Source: 'where()' function call; Sink: 'print()' outputs the CA bundle path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and only retrieves and outputs a standard certificate bundle location.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package, which provides the path to the trusted CA bundle. When executed as a script, it prints this path. There is no user input, no data processing, and no external data being fetched or sent. The code does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. It simply outputs a known, static resource location for certificate validation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple utility to print the path to the default CA bundle from certifi. It contains no malicious code or security risks and appears safe for use. It might be part of a larger system or used for debugging or configuration purposes.",
