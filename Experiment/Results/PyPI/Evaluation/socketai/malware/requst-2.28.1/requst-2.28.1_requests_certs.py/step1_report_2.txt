  "purpose": "Return the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from the certifi package; calling 'where()' function.",
  "sinks": "Printing the output of 'where()', which reveals the path to the CA bundle.",
  "flows": "The code imports a trusted library, then executes 'where()' and prints the path; data flows from library function to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple utility that prints the location of the CA bundle used by requests, relying on the certifi package. No untrusted input is processed, and no sensitive data is handled. The code uses a well-known, trusted library and performs a benign operation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It serves a legitimate purpose related to SSL/TLS security configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended to provide the CA bundle location. It does not contain malware or security risks. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
