{
  "purpose": "The code returns the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'certifi' package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The output (path to CA bundle) is printed to standard output.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function provides the CA bundle path, which is then printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; simple package utility.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' and, when executed directly, prints the path to the CA certificate bundle. It is a straightforward utility script with no user input handling, no network operations, and no data manipulation beyond printing a static resource path. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The use of 'certifi' is standard for certificate validation purposes. The code performs a simple read-and-print operation typical for configuration or informational scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script designed to output the default CA certificate bundle path from 'certifi'. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
