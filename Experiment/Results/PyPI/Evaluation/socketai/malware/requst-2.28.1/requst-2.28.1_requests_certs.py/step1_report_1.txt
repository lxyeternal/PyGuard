{
  "purpose": "Provide the default CA bundle path using certifi's where() function, primarily for use in SSL/TLS certificate validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the default CA bundle path from certifi's where() function.",
  "sinks": "The path returned by where() is printed to standard output, which could be captured or misused, but there are no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "The certifi where() function supplies the CA bundle path, which is then printed; no untrusted input flows into sensitive sinks or vice versa.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. It relies on the certifi package, which is standard for SSL certificate validation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports certifi's where() function to obtain the path to the trusted CA bundle. It then prints this path if run as a main program. There is no user input, no network activity, and no modification or malicious code present. The code serves a simple utility purpose. It does not perform any network communication, data modification, or contain any suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script that outputs the path to the default CA bundle provided by certifi. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
