  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports agree that the code simply imports `where()` from `certifi` and prints its output. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks. The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the script's purpose is to output the CA bundle path, with no suspicious activity. No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- securityRisk: 0\n\nThese are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is purely informational, with no malicious activity, higher risk scores are unjustified. The code does not perform any network operations, data modification, or contain hidden malicious payloads.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNo report makes unwarranted assumptions. They all correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent across reports and align with the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple utility script that outputs the path to the default CA bundle from the `certifi` package. It does not perform any malicious actions, handle untrusted input, or contain obfuscation. The security posture is entirely benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious activity or payload present                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected             |\n| Security Risk    | 0            | No vulnerabilities or risky behavior identified             |\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, benign, and serves a legitimate utility purpose.**",
