{
  "purpose": "The code implements an HTTP request and response handling library, managing URL encoding, headers, cookies, request bodies, and response parsing without any malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "URL parsing, header validation, request body encoding, cookie management, response reading and parsing.",
  "sinks": "Sending request data over network, reading response content, handling headers and cookies.",
  "flows": "Input data (URL, headers, body, cookies) flows through encoding and validation functions, then over network, and response data flows back into parsing and decoding functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, suspicious external connections, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard HTTP request/response operations, including URL parsing with IDNA encoding, header validation, body encoding for form-data or JSON, cookie handling, and response parsing with decoding and error handling. No suspicious or malicious logic is present. The functions and classes follow common patterns for an HTTP client library. The malware score is 0, as there are no signs of malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the standard nature of the code with minimal potential for misuse, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of an HTTP client component, with no evidence of supply chain attacks, malware, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
