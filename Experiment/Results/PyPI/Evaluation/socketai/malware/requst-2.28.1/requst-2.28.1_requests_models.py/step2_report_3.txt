  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, data flows, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles URL parsing, IDNA encoding, headers, request body encoding, cookies, and response parsing. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The risk score is low (0.2), malware score is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code performs standard HTTP request/response handling with no signs of malicious activity. The confidence (0.9) is justified.\n\n- **Recommendation:** The security risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate given the code's purpose and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing request construction, encoding, and response parsing. No malicious code or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries and patterns. Malware score is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No suspicious or malicious logic is present. The confidence level (0.9) is reasonable.\n\n- **Recommendation:** The security risk score of 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on request and response construction, encoding, headers, cookies, and error handling. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. Uses standard patterns.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code. No signs of sabotage or malware.\n\n- **Recommendation:** The malware score remains 0; the security risk score of 0.1 is suitable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes request and response handling, encoding, headers, cookies, and streaming. No malicious code or obfuscation. Standard practices.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is valid. No suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Recommendation:** Malware score is 0; security risk score of 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar overview, emphasizing safe handling of request/response, encoding, headers, cookies, and streaming. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code's functionality.\n\n- **Recommendation:** Malware score remains 0; security risk score of 0.1 fits.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code is a standard HTTP client implementation with no malicious payloads or behaviors.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the thorough review and lack of suspicious activity, a low risk score (around 0.1–0.2) is justified. The current scores (mostly 0.1–0.2) are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (standard request/response handling with minimal risk)\n\n**Note:** The code is a legitimate part of the Requests library, performing expected functions without malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
