  "purpose": "This module provides classes and functions to build, prepare, and handle HTTP requests and responses in the Requests library, facilitating HTTP communication in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from URL strings, headers, cookies, files, JSON data, and hooks. It also reads from file-like objects in methods such as prepare_body and iter_content.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data can flow into the request body, headers, cookies, or URL parameters. The response content is also a sink for data received from the server.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs such as URL, headers, data, files, JSON, or hooks into request preparation methods. Untrusted inputs (e.g., URL, headers, JSON) are processed and then used to construct HTTP requests. Response content from server responses is processed through iter_content and json methods, which could expose untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code employs standard libraries and well-known patterns for HTTP request handling. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution patterns are present. Use of `__dict__.update()` in prepare_auth could be considered dynamic, but it is standard for updating object state.\nSome functions like prepare_cookies directly set headers, but do not manipulate sensitive data maliciously. The extensive use of exception handling appears standard.\nThe code appears to be a typical implementation of a request/response handling system with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive implementation of request and response handling within the Requests library. It carefully encodes parameters and files, manages headers, cookies, and authentication, and provides mechanisms to iterate over response content and handle redirects. No suspicious code, hidden backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are present. All data flows and sinks align with standard HTTP communication practices. There are no signs of malware or sabotage; the code appears legitimate and intended for normal operation. The use of standard exception handling and safe data encoding techniques further indicates sound, secure design.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, legitimate implementation of request and response processing in an HTTP client library. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware indicators are detected. The code follows typical patterns for secure HTTP handling, with no signs of supply chain attacks or harmful payloads.",
