{
  "purpose": "The code sets up the 'requests' HTTP library, handles dependencies, compatibility checks, and configurations for secure HTTP requests in Python.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version checks, cryptography and ssl module imports, base64 decoding execution.",
  "sinks": "exec() with base64-decoded code, warnings, and logging configuration.",
  "flows": "Base64-decoded code executed via exec() reads and executes hidden code, which is a direct source to sink, potentially running malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with base64-decoded data is unusual and suspicious, indicating possible obfuscation or malicious intent. The rest of the code appears standard for a well-known library setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily configures the requests library, handles dependencies, version checks, and SSL compatibility. The critical anomaly is the execution of base64-decoded code via exec(), which is a common technique to hide malicious payloads or obfuscate code. All other parts are standard library setup and dependency validation, with no other suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious obfuscated payload executed via exec() with base64 decoding, which could run arbitrary code. The remaining code appears legitimate and standard for the 'requests' library setup, but the presence of exec() with encoded data significantly raises concern.",
