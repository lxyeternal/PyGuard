  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script with some risky practices like exec() and os.system(), but no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The main issues are potential security risks if files are tampered with and code quality problems. The package name typo could be benign or suspicious but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the script's security risk is low, and it does not contain malware."
