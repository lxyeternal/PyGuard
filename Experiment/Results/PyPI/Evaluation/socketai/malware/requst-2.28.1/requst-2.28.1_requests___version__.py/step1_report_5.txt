{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Constants defining metadata (e.g., __title__, __description__, __url__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; static metadata assigned to variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art comment at the top, which is purely cosmetic and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of variable assignments for package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author info, and license. These are static string values. There are no inputs, no code execution, no network activity, nor any suspicious behavior. The ASCII art comment is a benign decoration and not indicative of malicious intent. No code that reads external input, processes untrusted data, or interacts with the system beyond defining constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless package metadata declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign component of a Python package setup.",
