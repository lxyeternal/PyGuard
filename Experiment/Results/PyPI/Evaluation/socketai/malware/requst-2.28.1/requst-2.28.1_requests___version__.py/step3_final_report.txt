  "purpose": "Define package metadata variables for the 'requests' Python library, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and decorative Unicode characters.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments within the code, including the ASCII art comment at the top.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Decorative ASCII art comment; no obfuscation or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. No dynamic behavior, input handling, or external communication is present. The ASCII art is purely decorative. All assessments correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious or malicious elements. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, metadata-only nature of the code. Confidence is high (1), given the straightforward analysis. No anomalies or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as static package metadata with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
