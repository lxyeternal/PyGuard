      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script with some risky practices like exec() and os.system(), but no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The main issues are potential security risks if files are tampered with and code quality problems. The package name typo could be benign or suspicious but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the script's security risk is low, and it does not contain malware."

      "obfuscated": 0.9,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious characteristics due to the use of obfuscated exec() executing remote code, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, with the highest severity in cases explicitly involving remote code fetch. The overall security risk is very high, and the code should be treated as malicious or compromised. Further decoding and analysis of the remote payloads are strongly recommended."

Existing reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use within the Requests library."

There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The sys.modules modifications are unconventional but typical for compatibility patches. Overall, the code poses a low security risk and is not malicious."
