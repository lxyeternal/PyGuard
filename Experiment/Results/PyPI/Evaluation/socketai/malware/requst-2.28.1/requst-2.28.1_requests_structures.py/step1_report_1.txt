  "purpose": "Provides data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data for dictionary initialization and updates (via constructors and update methods).",
  "sinks": "Dictionary access and modification methods (__getitem__, __setitem__, __delitem__, get, lower_items).",
  "flows": "Input data flows into internal storage (_store or __dict__), accessed through standard dictionary methods, with key normalization for case-insensitivity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. Both classes implement dictionary-like behavior with custom features. CaseInsensitiveDict uses an OrderedDict to store keys in a case-insensitive manner while preserving the original case for display. It implements standard dict methods, including update, copy, and comparison. LookupDict is a simple subclass of dict that adds a name attribute and customized __repr__, with __getitem__ and get methods that access the internal __dict__ attribute. There is no code that performs network activity, data exfiltration, or executes code dynamically. The code is straightforward, standard, and lacks any signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries, used internally within the Requests library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
