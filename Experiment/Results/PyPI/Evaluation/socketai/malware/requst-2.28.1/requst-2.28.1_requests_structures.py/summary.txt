  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor flaw in the copy() method is a correctness issue, not a security concern. Existing reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use within the Requests library."
