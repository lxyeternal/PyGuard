  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, but without specific context or comments, it's not entirely clear.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly present in the provided code snippet; no functions for reading user input, files, or network data are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are not explicitly found; there are no visible operations involving untrusted data leading to system calls, network transmissions, or file modifications.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows, as the code does not process external or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated sections are present in the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation with standard Python features. No external data sources, untrusted inputs, or suspicious behavior such as network activity or system modifications are observable. The structure and syntax are normal, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code injections. Without further context or additional code, no malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign and does not pose any threat in its current form.",
