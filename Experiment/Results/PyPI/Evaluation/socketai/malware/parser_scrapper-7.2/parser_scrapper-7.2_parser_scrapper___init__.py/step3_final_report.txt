{
  "purpose": "The code snippets are benign scripts performing data processing, network initialization, or simple output, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, or standard library functions; no external untrusted sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Output functions like print, or data stored in logs/files; no data leaks or malicious exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input sources to processing functions to output or storage; no malicious or suspicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs identified; code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "Static review of provided code snippets shows no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate. Security risk scores are low (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting minimal concern given the benign nature. Confidence levels are high where code is present, moderate where no code is provided. The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are safe, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, and no revisions are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
