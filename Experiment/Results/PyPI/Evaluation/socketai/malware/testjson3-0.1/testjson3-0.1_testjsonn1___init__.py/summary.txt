  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to its ability to download and execute arbitrary code without validation, facilitating supply chain attacks and remote code execution. The high malware (around 0.85) and security risk (around 0.9) scores are justified. It should be considered highly dangerous and unsuitable for use in untrusted environments. Proper validation, sandboxing, and security controls are essential if such functionality is necessary."
