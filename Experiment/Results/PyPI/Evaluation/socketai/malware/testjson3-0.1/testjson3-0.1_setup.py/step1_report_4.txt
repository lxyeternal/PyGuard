  "purpose": "Define a setup configuration for a Python package with a custom install command that executes code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package source files, and within the CustomCommand.run method, it imports a function from 'testjsonn1' and makes an HTTP request to download a Python script.",
  "sinks": "The 'requests.get' call fetches external code, which is then executed indirectly via 'main', potentially running malicious code. Also, importing 'main' from 'testjsonn1' could be risky if 'testjsonn1' contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the CustomCommand.run method triggers: it downloads a remote script and then calls 'main' with the URL and a filename, which may execute remote code or malicious scripts.",
  "anomalies": "The 'run' method downloads a script from a Discord CDN link—unusual source for code execution. The script is fetched during installation and passed directly to 'main', implying code execution without validation. No validation or sandboxing is present.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation command that, when invoked, imports a function 'main' from 'testjsonn1' and makes an HTTP GET request to a Discord URL to fetch a Python script. The fetched code is passed to 'main', which likely executes it. This behavior could allow remote code execution during package installation, representing a significant security risk. The package dependencies include 'requests' and 'pyperclip', which are standard, but the primary concern is the remote code fetch and execution flow triggered during installation. No obfuscation or encryption appears; the code is straightforward but malicious in intent due to remote code execution capability.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during package installation, representing a high security risk. The use of a Discord CDN link for fetching executable code is suspicious and potentially dangerous. It should be considered unsafe for distribution.",
