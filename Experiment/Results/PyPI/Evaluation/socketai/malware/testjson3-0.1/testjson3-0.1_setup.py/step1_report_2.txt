  "purpose": "Define a custom setup command to execute a function that fetches and runs a script from a URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The URL in the run() method: 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1083783447291629640/1264390340518088725/my_script.py?ex=669db2c4&is=669c6144&hm=fbd568cff7d5184f934296c0af188d504ce192e6bffcab904e0218361a8c32f8&'",
  "sinks": "Executing main() which imports and likely executes code from the fetched URL; uses requests to download external code.",
  "flows": "run() -> import requests -> fetch URL -> import main from testjsonn1 (which may execute code) -> run main function with URL content",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and executes external code during installation without validation, which is highly unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, when run, imports a function 'main' from a local module and calls it with a URL. The URL points to a script hosted on Discord, which is fetched dynamically during installation. This indicates potential malicious behavior, as it can execute arbitrary code from an external source without verification. The use of requests to download external code and immediate execution is a security concern. The package setup itself appears normal but includes this dangerous dynamic execution step.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains a high-risk pattern by fetching and executing remote code during installation, which could be malicious. This behavior suggests a supply chain attack vector or malicious intent.",
