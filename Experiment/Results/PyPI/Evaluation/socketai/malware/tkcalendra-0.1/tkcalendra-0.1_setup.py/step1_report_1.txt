  "purpose": "Obfuscated setup script possibly designed to install a Python package and execute hidden or malicious operations based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Sys.argv input, environment variables, imported modules (pip, os, win32com, ctypes), file system operations (os.makedirs, os.path.exists, os.path.expanduser, os.path.basename, open, close, Save, CreateShortcut), and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "os.makedirs, os.path.exists, os.path.expanduser, os.path.basename, open, close, Save, CreateShortcut, os.getenv, os.walk, os.path.expanduser, os.path.isdir, ctypes.windll.shell32.IsUserAnAdmin, possibly network/file operations.",
  "flows": "sys.argv[] → conditional branches → possible malicious module imports and file system/network operations based on command-line arguments → environment variable access → potentially dangerous file system modifications or network activities.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code using complex bitwise and string manipulations to generate strings for import and function calls. Variables are named with non-descriptive, symbolic characters. Conditional logic based on large computed integers; presence of module imports like pip, os, win32com, ctypes inside conditional branches. Use of environment variables and file operations in a suspicious manner. Hidden code to create shortcuts, check admin rights, manipulate files, and possibly escalate privileges or exfiltrate data.",
  "analysis": "The script uses extensive obfuscation via complex bitwise operations, string manipulations, and dynamic module imports to hide its true intentions. It reacts to command-line arguments, executing different code blocks that import potentially harmful modules like pip, os, win32com, and ctypes. It performs file system operations such as creating directories, checking for admin rights, and manipulating files/shortcuts. Certain code sections involve environment variables, network operations (via win32com or os.walk), and system privilege checks. The code also contains repetitive pattern of convoluted calculations that seem designed to hide malicious activities or data exfiltration routines. The presence of hidden conditional branches and obfuscated variable names strongly suggests malicious intent or sabotage. No benign or legitimate setup activities are clearly identifiable, and the code exhibits signs of malware or sabotage targeting system configuration, privilege escalation, or data access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated with complex calculations and dynamic imports, indicating malicious intent. It reacts to specific command-line arguments to execute potentially dangerous system modifications, file operations, and privilege checks. The extensive use of obscure code patterns and system calls suggests this package could perform unauthorized actions or system sabotage. It is strongly recommended not to use or install this package.",
