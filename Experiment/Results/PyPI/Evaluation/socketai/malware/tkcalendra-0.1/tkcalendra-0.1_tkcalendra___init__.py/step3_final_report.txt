  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, focusing on dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and suspicious data flows.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, files, network connections, system commands",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, file system, system processes, environment variables",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network transmission, file writes, or system commands, often via eval/exec or indirect data handling",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscated variable names or strings, hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, indirect data handling, lack of comments or documentation",
  "analysis": "Multiple reports indicate the presence of dynamic code execution and obfuscation, which are classic indicators of potential malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware around 0.6-0.65, obfuscation around 0.75, risk around 0.6-0.65) are consistent with the described suspicious patterns. No concrete evidence of active malware or payloads is observed, but the behaviors warrant caution. The absence of code in some reports leads to low scores, which is appropriate. Overall, the assessments are cautious and aligned with security best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution, but lacks definitive malicious activity evidence. The scores are justified and suggest further detailed code review or behavioral analysis is recommended to confirm malicious intent.",
