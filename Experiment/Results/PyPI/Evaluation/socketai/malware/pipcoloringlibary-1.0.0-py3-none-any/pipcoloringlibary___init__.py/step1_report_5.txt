{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a malicious payload designed to extract sensitive user data, such as cookies, passwords, tokens, system information, and browser data, then exfiltrate it via Discord webhooks or upload to file-sharing services. It also includes functionalities to disable security measures, kill processes, and potentially manipulate user data for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., COMPUTERNAME, LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), reads browser files and local state files for decryption keys, reads cookies, passwords, history, credit card info, and tokens from local databases and files, captures screenshots, and monitors running processes.",
  "sinks": "Posts data to remote Discord webhook URLs, uploads files to external file-sharing services (transfer.sh, anonfiles), executes system commands (e.g., taskkill), modifies system registry, and writes sensitive data to local files before exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Reads system info and browser data (sources), decrypts sensitive information using Windows Data Protection API, then sends this data via HTTP POST requests to specified webhook URLs or uploads to external servers. It also manipulates clipboard data to potentially hijack cryptocurrency addresses, and terminates security or monitoring processes before extraction.",
  "anomalies": "Contains hardcoded webhook URLs, cryptic variable names, obfuscated/deceptive comments, multiple self-startup and process-killing routines, repeated attempts to decrypt browser data, and extensive data exfiltration routines. Uses threading for concurrent data collection. Presence of functions designed for process termination and disabling security tools indicates sabotage intent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by installing numerous Python packages, some of which are related to system and network operations, indicating setup for extensive data collection. It then defines multiple classes: one for core functions (system info, decrypting data, network info), a main class for data theft including cookies, passwords, system info, and tokens, and another class for anti-debugging and process checks. The code collects user system info, browser credentials, cookies, and tokens, then zips and uploads them. It employs techniques to disable or kill security tools and processes, and manipulates clipboard data for cryptocurrency addresses. The code exfiltrates all gathered data to a Discord webhook or via file uploads, making it a comprehensive info-stealer with malicious sabotage capabilities. It also includes obfuscation patterns such as dynamic imports, encrypted strings, and threading, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is malicious spyware and data stealer designed to harvest sensitive user data, disable security measures, and exfiltrate information covertly. It employs multiple techniques to evade detection and to maximize data theft. Given its functionality, it is highly dangerous and should not be used or trusted.",
