{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package named 'tpstrintnvidia' with a dependency on 'modlib'. It also executes a suspicious PowerShell command if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existence of the directory 'tahg'. It executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen. It also imports modules such as 'subprocess' and 'os'.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes an encoded PowerShell command, which could be used to run malicious payloads or download malicious content. The setup function itself is benign but is used as a cover for the malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Code checks for 'tahg' directory -> If not present, executes encoded PowerShell command -> proceeds with setup of the package, which appears legitimate.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of the encoded PowerShell command that runs in the background without user consent is suspicious. The domain in the comment ('www.esquelesquad.rip') is suspicious. The command is encoded, making it harder to analyze, which is a common tactic to obfuscate malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing 'setup' from distutils.core and tries to import 'subprocess' and 'os'. It then checks if the directory 'tahg' exists; if not, it runs an encoded PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads. Afterward, it attempts to set up a package called 'tpstrintnvidia' with metadata and dependencies. The setup process is standard, but the prior execution of suspicious code indicates malicious intent. The use of encoded PowerShell and a suspicious domain suggests potential malware activity or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior through the execution of an encoded PowerShell command that executes without user interaction, which is a strong indicator of malware or malicious activity embedded within a seemingly benign setup script. The package setup appears legitimate but is likely used as a cover for malicious actions.",
