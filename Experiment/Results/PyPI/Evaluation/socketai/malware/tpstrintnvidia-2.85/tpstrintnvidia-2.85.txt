      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package installation. The use of broad exception handling and suspicious comments further support malicious intent. The overall security risk is very high, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious."
