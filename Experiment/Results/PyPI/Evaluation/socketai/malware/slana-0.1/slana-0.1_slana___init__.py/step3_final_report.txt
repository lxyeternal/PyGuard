  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec), standard library imports, input/output functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of untrusted code via eval/exec, data leakage through environment variables, network connections if present.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) to eval/exec or other execution points, possibly leading to malicious code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec without safeguards, obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, absence of code or suspicious patterns in some reports.",
  "analysis": "Most reports lack code, limiting analysis; Report 1 indicates dynamic execution and potential risks but no confirmed malicious activity; scores are generally consistent with evidence. Slight adjustment recommended for Report 1's security risk score from 0.3 to 0.4 to better reflect the danger posed by eval/exec usage. Other reports correctly assign low or zero scores given the absence of code or suspicious patterns. Confidence levels are appropriate, with higher confidence in reports with actual code and lower where code is missing. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is found across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment is that the dependency is benign with minimal security risks. The primary concern is the use of eval/exec, which warrants cautious review. Scores are mostly appropriate; adjusting Report 1's risk score to 0.4 enhances accuracy. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.",
