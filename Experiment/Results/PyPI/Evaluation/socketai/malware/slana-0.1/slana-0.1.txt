      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and system interaction capabilities consistent with malicious payloads. It can perform privilege escalation, system modifications, and package installations under the guise of a setup script. Given these behaviors, it should be classified as malicious or highly suspicious, warranting immediate review and quarantine. The malware score is set to 0.95, obfuscation at 0.9, and overall security risk at 0.9, reflecting the high threat level."

      "conclusion": "The overall assessment is that the dependency is benign with minimal security risks. The primary concern is the use of eval/exec, which warrants cautious review. Scores are mostly appropriate; adjusting Report 1's risk score to 0.4 enhances accuracy. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected."
