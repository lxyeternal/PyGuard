{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a Python package setup script that includes a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during the custom install process.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends data (hostname, cwd, username) to a remote server at 9.30.214.68:9090.",
  "flows": "During installation, the script collects system info (source) and immediately sends it over HTTP GET request (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code exfiltrates system information without user consent during installation, which is suspicious. The IP address is hardcoded and used for data exfiltration. The setup script itself is intended for package installation, which is unusual for malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules to gather system information: socket for hostname, getpass for username, os for current directory. It defines a custom install class that, upon running, executes the normal install process and then gathers system info. It then sends this info to a remote server via an HTTP GET request. The remote IP and the data sent suggest a data exfiltration attempt embedded within a package installation routine. The purpose is likely malicious, aiming to silently collect user environment data during package install.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating user system information during package installation without user consent. The IP address and data collection process indicate an attempt to spy on the user system, making this highly suspicious and malicious.",
