{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it also exfiltrates system information upon installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username via socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends collected data to an external IP address, acting as an external data exfiltration point.",
  "flows": "Data collected from hostname, cwd, and username (sources) are sent over HTTP GET request to external server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system info to an external IP during package installation, which is not typical for setup scripts. The external IP (9.30.214.68) is suspicious and untrusted. The description 'Exfiltration' explicitly suggests malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with an added class CustomInstall that overrides the run method. After executing the normal installation process, it gathers system info—hostname, current working directory, username—and sends this data to an external IP address via a GET request. The IP address and the 'Exfiltration' description strongly suggest malicious behavior, specifically data exfiltration during package installation. No other malicious or obfuscated code is present; the behavior is clear and intentional.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to exfiltrate system information during package installation, indicating malicious intent. The external request and the 'Exfiltration' description confirm malicious behavior. The package poses a security risk and should not be used.",
