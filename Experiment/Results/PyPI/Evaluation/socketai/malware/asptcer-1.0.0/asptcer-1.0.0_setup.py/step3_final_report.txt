{
  "purpose": "The code performs data exfiltration by collecting system information and sending it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname via socket.gethostname(), current working directory via os.getcwd(), and username via getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call sending data to 'http://9.30.214.68:9090'.",
  "flows": "System info is collected from sources and transmitted via HTTP GET request to the external IP during the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data exfiltration during installation, hardcoded external IP, no user consent, straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly collects hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data to a hardcoded external IP during the installation process. The behavior is clear, not obfuscated, and occurs silently, indicating malicious intent. The data flow from sources to sink is direct and unprotected. The code's purpose aligns with malicious data theft or spying activities. No logical flaws or false assumptions are present; the activity is unequivocally malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious exfiltration behavior during package installation, with no obfuscation or benign explanation. It poses a high security risk and should be considered malware. The activity warrants maximum malware and security risk scores.",
