{
  "purpose": "Custom installation script that performs standard package setup and additionally exfiltrates system information to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, current working directory, and username via socket, os, and getpass modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses requests.get to send collected data to an external IP address, which can be used for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Collects hostname, cwd, username -> sends these parameters via HTTP GET request to external server during install.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior: network request during package installation to an untrusted IP address, exfiltration of system info without user consent, custom install class overriding default behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the standard setup install command to include additional code that gathers system information such as hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this data to a specific IP address via an HTTP GET request. This behavior is not typical for a benign Python package and indicates an attempt at data exfiltration. The IP address and the description 'Exfiltration' in the setup metadata further suggest malicious intent. No other malicious activities like code obfuscation, backdoors, or harmful system modifications are present, but the data exfiltration mechanism itself is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden malicious behavior: exfiltration of user and system data during package installation, which is indicative of malicious intent. The setup script's primary purpose appears to be covert data collection rather than legitimate package setup.",
