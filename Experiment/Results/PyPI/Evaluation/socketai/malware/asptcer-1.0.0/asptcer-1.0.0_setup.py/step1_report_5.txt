{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that exfiltrates system information during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, current working directory, and username using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP GET request to a suspicious external IP address (http://9.30.214.68:9090) using requests.get().",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, cwd, username) flows from source functions into the request parameters and is sent to the external server during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during setup without any user consent or notification. The IP address used for exfiltration appears suspicious and unrelated to legitimate package functionality. No documentation or comments indicate malicious intent, but the behavior is highly suspicious and covert.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a third-party requests library. It defines a custom install class that, upon execution, collects hostname, current directory, and username. Immediately after installation, it sends this data to an external IP address via HTTP GET, which is unusual behavior for a package setup process. The purpose appears to be clandestine data collection, indicating malicious intent. The code uses standard library functions but repurposes them for exfiltration, which is a malicious activity masked as part of setup. There are no obfuscation techniques or other suspicious coding practices besides the covert data transfer.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external server during installation. This behavior suggests malicious intent and poses a security risk, especially since it operates silently during package setup. It should be considered highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
