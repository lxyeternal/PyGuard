  "sinks": "requests.get() to external IP address",
  "flows": "collect hostname, current directory, and username; send data via HTTP GET request to external server",
  "anomalies": "Exfiltration of system info during installation, hardcoded external IP, no user consent or indication of data collection",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to include a network request that sends the system's hostname, current working directory, and username to an external IP address. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation without informing the user, which is suspicious. The external IP is hardcoded and untrusted, indicating potential data exfiltration. There are no other malicious behaviors like code execution, backdoors, or data theft beyond information leakage. The code structure is straightforward, but the malicious intent of collecting and transmitting user data during install raises significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent. It poses a security risk as it silently leaks data to an external server, which could be used for tracking or malicious purposes.",
