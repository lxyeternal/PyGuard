  "conclusion": "The code contains a heavily obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command during package setup, representing a high security risk and likely malicious intent. The obfuscation and stealthy execution are red flags for supply chain sabotage or malware. Scores are justified as malware 0.85, obfuscated 0.9, security risk 0.9, reflecting high suspicion and danger."
