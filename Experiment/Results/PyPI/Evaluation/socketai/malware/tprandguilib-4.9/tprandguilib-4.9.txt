      "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell command during package setup, strongly indicating malicious intent. The presence of a suspicious URL, obfuscation, and error suppression suggests the code is designed to conceal malicious payloads or remote control mechanisms. It should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious until decoded and verified."
