  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the silent, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup. This pattern indicates potential for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The high obfuscation and error suppression further support a malicious or at least highly risky intent. Further payload analysis is recommended before trusting or distributing this package."
