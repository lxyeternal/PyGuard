{
  "purpose": "Detects and analyzes obfuscated PowerShell commands executed during package setup, which may indicate malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.Popen call executing a base64-encoded PowerShell command when the 'tahg' directory does not exist.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the encoded PowerShell command, which could lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory -> if absent, executes the encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen -> command runs silently in background.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently with hidden window flags; broad try-except blocks suppress errors; presence of suspicious URL comment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a conditional execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during setup, which is suspicious. The command is base64-encoded, indicating obfuscation. Silent execution and error suppression further increase suspicion. The rest of the setup code appears benign. Without decoding the command, the malicious intent cannot be definitively confirmed, but the pattern strongly suggests malicious or sabotage activity. The use of broad exception handling may hide failures or malicious attempts. The URL comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' is also suspicious. Given these signals, the code poses a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated, potentially malicious PowerShell code executed silently during installation, representing a high security threat. Decoding the base64 payload is essential for confirmation, but current evidence warrants a high malware score and security risk rating.",
