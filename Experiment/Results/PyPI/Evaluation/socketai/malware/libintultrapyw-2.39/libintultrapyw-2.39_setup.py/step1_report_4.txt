{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package named 'libintultrapyw', including installation instructions and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, checks for file existence ('tahg'), and attempts to run a subprocess with an encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call with the encoded command potentially executes malicious PowerShell code, which could lead to remote code execution or system compromise.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the script executes a hidden PowerShell process with encoded commands, which could be malicious. The setup call is standard and unlikely to pose security issues.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an encoded PowerShell command that is executed with 'subprocess.Popen' in a hidden window. The base64-encoded string, when decoded, may contain malicious instructions. The URL in the comment ('www.esquelesquad.rip') is suspicious and could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code first checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg'. If it doesn't exist, it runs a PowerShell command encoded in base64, hidden from the user. The encoded command likely contains malicious payloads, potentially to establish remote access or execute malicious scripts. The setup function is standard, with no suspicious package data. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command is the primary concern, as it indicates an attempt to execute potentially malicious code without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a highly suspicious encoded PowerShell command that is executed silently, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent or compromise. The setup part is normal, but the conditional execution of the encoded command suggests malicious behavior or sabotage.",
