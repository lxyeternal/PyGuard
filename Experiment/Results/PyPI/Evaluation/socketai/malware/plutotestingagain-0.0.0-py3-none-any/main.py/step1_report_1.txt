{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed to extract sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from user systems, then exfiltrate this data via webhooks and file uploads. It also collects browser data, Discord tokens, and files from user directories for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from log files (.log, .ldb), browser data files, Local State files, and specific directories (e.g., Desktop, Downloads, Documents). Also reads environment variables, environment data, and system files related to browsers, Discord, and Steam.",
  "sinks": "Exfiltrates data via HTTP POST requests to external webhooks (e.g., 'https://webhook.wyvern.lol') and uploads files to external servers ('gofile.io' and 'anonfiles'). Uses subprocess to terminate processes and copy files, then uploads these files. Writes sensitive data to temp files before uploading.",
  "flows": "Sources (local files, environment variables, web requests) are read and processed; sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, browser storage, and files are collected; then sent via HTTP requests or uploaded to external servers. Browser tokens and credentials are decrypted using system APIs and stored data; tokens are validated before exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive collection of sensitive data (tokens, cookies, passwords, files) with minimal validation. Use of obfuscated regex patterns and dynamic process termination. Hardcoded webhook URL. Repeated process termination commands. Lack of user consent or safeguards. The code structure and multiple layers of obfuscation indicate malicious intent. The script attempts to collect data stealthily, including from popular browsers and applications, and exfiltrate via various external endpoints.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive info-stealer targeting user tokens, passwords, cookies, browser data, and files from common user directories and applications. It decrypts stored browser credentials, scans log files for tokens, and collects Discord info. It then exfiltrates data through webhooks and file uploads. The code employs multiple threading, process termination, and file copying to obfuscate and ensure data collection. The presence of hardcoded webhook, aggressive process kills, and stealthy data collection tactics strongly suggest malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a malicious info-stealer designed to harvest sensitive user data, including tokens, passwords, cookies, files, and system information, then exfiltrate it to external servers via webhooks and uploads. Its structure and behaviors clearly indicate malicious intent and high security risk.",
