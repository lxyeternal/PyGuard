{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, browser data, and files from the user's system, then exfiltrate this data to a remote webhook or upload service.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, local files (browser storage, login data, cookies, local state), network requests to external APIs (IP geolocation, Discord API), and local file system reads for various user data and browser data.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to remote URLs via HTTP POST requests to a Discord webhook, external file upload services (gofile.io, anonfiles), and potentially other upload endpoints. Files are written to temporary locations before upload.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files flow from local sources (browser storage, login data, cookies, local state) to exfiltration points (webhook messages, file upload services). Functions like 'upl05dT4k31' and 'uploadToAnonfiles' serve as sinks where data is transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes extensive use of thread creation for parallel data collection, obfuscation-like patterns in variable naming, and direct execution of system commands like 'taskkill' to terminate processes (e.g., browsers, wallet apps). The code also installs missing Python modules silently, which may be unnecessary for legitimate operations. The use of regex to extract tokens and credentials is a sign of malicious intent. The script also collects system info, Discord account info, and files without user consent, and transmits this to external services.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to harvest sensitive user data from browsers, Discord, and installed applications. It uses system-specific paths, decrypts stored passwords and cookies, collects tokens from log files, and uploads the data to remote servers. The use of threading accelerates data collection. It terminates certain processes to access locked files, indicating malicious intent. The code also includes functions to gather files matching specific keywords and uploads them. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and upload links confirms data exfiltration. The code appears obfuscated in some parts via variable names and complex flow, but no true obfuscation techniques like encoding or encryption are present outside of the decryption functions. The overall design is consistent with typical information-stealing malware, aimed at stealthily extracting user credentials and system information and sending it to a remote server.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions as a credential, cookie, and file stealer, exfiltrating user data to remote services. It terminates security-relevant processes, decrypts stored browser data, and uploads the information to external servers. Its structure and behavior strongly suggest malicious intent, designed for unauthorized data collection and exfiltration.",
