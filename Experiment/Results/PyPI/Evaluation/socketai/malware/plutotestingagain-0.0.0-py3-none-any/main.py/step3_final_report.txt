{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious info-stealer targeting tokens, passwords, cookies, browser data, files, and system information. It decrypts stored credentials, collects sensitive data from various sources, and exfiltrates via webhooks and file uploads, all while attempting to evade detection.",
  "sources": "Reads from browser storage (local state, login data, cookies), log files (.log, .ldb), environment variables, user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents), Discord API, wallet/application directories, and local system files.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via a hardcoded webhook URL and uploads files to external services (gofile.io, anonfiles). Uses HTTP requests, subprocess commands to terminate processes, and file uploads for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local files and system APIs, decrypted if necessary, formatted into JSON payloads, and transmitted via HTTP POST requests or uploaded files, often using threading for concurrency. Process termination commands are issued to disable security or lock files before collection.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded webhook URL, silent dependency installation, process termination commands, regex-based token extraction, and mild obfuscation in variable names and regex patterns. Employs threading to speed up data collection and exfiltration routines.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits extensive malicious behaviors: credential decryption using Windows APIs, token extraction via regex, collection of browser and application data, process termination to disable security or lock files, and exfiltration through webhooks and file uploads. The code's structure and routines align with known info-stealer malware. Obfuscation is minimal to moderate, primarily variable naming and regex complexity. The use of threading and silent module installation indicates stealth and efficiency. Overall, the code is a high-severity malicious info-stealer designed for comprehensive data theft and exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info-stealer that decrypts and harvests sensitive credentials, tokens, cookies, and files, then exfiltrates the data stealthily via webhooks and uploads. Its behaviors match typical malware patterns, and it poses a high security threat.",
