{
  "purpose": "The code is designed as a malicious data collector (stealer) that extracts sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, billing data, and files from various browsers, applications, and system directories. It then exfiltrates this data to a remote webhook and file hosting services.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, local files (browser databases, local state, logs), network requests to APIs for geolocation and Discord info, and user directories such as Desktop, Downloads, and Documents. It also reads local system and application files related to browsers, Discord, Steam, wallets, and other applications.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests to a remote webhook URL and uploaded to file hosting services (gofile.io, anonfiles). It also writes logs and files locally in the temp directory before uploading. Sensitive information like tokens, cookies, passwords, and user data are exfiltrated.",
  "flows": "Sources such as tokens, cookies, passwords, and files are gathered from local files and system directories. These are then processed (decoded, decrypted), stored temporarily, and sent to remote endpoints via HTTP requests or uploaded files. Multiple threads handle different data collection tasks concurrently. Data flows from local system/extracted content to remote webhooks and file hosts.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obfuscated regex patterns, dynamic thread creation, and attempts to automatically install dependencies (requests, pycryptodome) at runtime, which could be suspicious. The code includes functions for decrypting Windows DPAPI data, decrypting Chrome/Chromium stored passwords and cookies, and extracting tokens from logs. It actively searches common locations for sensitive files, including browser data and messaging app directories. It also kills processes related to browsers and wallet applications to access files.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive credential and data stealer targeting browsers, Discord, wallets, and various applications. It collects tokens, cookies, passwords, billing info, and files. It decrypts encrypted data using Windows DPAPI and AES-GCM. It exfiltrates data via webhooks and uploads files to external hosts. The code includes obfuscation techniques, dynamic dependency installation, and multi-threaded data collection, indicating intent to operate stealthily and avoid detection. It also implements functions to gather system info and user data for potential further exploitation.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear malicious intent as a credential and data stealer. It systematically extracts sensitive data from user systems, decrypts encrypted tokens and passwords, and exfiltrates the information to external servers. Its techniques for obfuscation, process termination, and dependency management suggest an attempt to evade detection and ensure operation persistence. Overall, the code is malicious with high potential harm, and it should be considered dangerous for use.",
