{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract, decrypt, and upload sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, files, and browser information from the victim's system. It also gathers information about installed applications and browser data, then exfiltrates this data to remote servers.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, local files (browser databases, local storage, cookies), system directories, and user input via logs and files in directories like Desktop, Downloads, and Documents.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data is sent via HTTP POST requests to webhook URLs and upload services, often containing sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files. The data is sent in JSON format to external servers.",
  "flows": "Sources such as system files, browser databases, and logs are decrypted and read; sensitive data like tokens, passwords, and cookies are extracted; then this data flows into payloads assembled for exfiltration via HTTP POST requests to remote endpoints (webhook and file upload services).",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URLs, the use of threading for concurrent data collection, and functions that automate the installation of missing Python modules. It also performs potentially malicious file and data exfiltration without user consent, and attempts to decrypt stored credentials and tokens. The presence of functions to extract tokens from logs and browsers and the obfuscated style of some code segments suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script demonstrates typical behaviors of malware designed for credential theft and data exfiltration. It gathers tokens, passwords, cookies, and browser data, decrypts stored credentials, and uploads them to external services. The code installs dependencies automatically, indicates persistence by scanning common browser and app directories, and exfiltrates data via webhooks and upload services. The presence of functions that terminate processes related to known security or cryptocurrency applications suggests an attempt to disable security measures or mining activities. The code structure, including the use of threading, encrypted data handling, and automated data collection routines, supports a malicious purpose. There are no signs of obfuscation or complex anti-analysis techniques, but the deliberate collection and exfiltration of sensitive data confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a malicious data-stealing malware (spyware/infostealer) targeting browser credentials, tokens, cookies, system files, and personal data. It exfiltrates this information to external servers via webhooks and file upload services, indicating high malicious intent. The code structure and behaviors strongly suggest it is designed for unauthorized access, credential theft, and privacy violation.",
