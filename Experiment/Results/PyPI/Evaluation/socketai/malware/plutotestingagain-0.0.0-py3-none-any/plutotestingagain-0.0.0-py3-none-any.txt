      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with the primary issue being the improper listing of standard library modules as dependencies. There is no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk stems from misconfiguration, not malicious activity. Correcting the dependencies list is recommended but does not impact security."

      "conclusion": "The code itself appears benign; the primary concern is the trustworthiness of the 'main' module and its 'GatherAll' function. Without inspecting 'main', the overall security risk remains moderate. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. It is recommended to review the source code of 'main.py' and 'GatherAll' before execution, especially in supply chain contexts."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet appears benign in isolation; the main concern is the behavior of 'GatherAll()' within 'main'. The current scores are appropriate, and no evidence suggests malicious activity. Further investigation of 'main.py' is recommended to fully assess security risks."

      "conclusion": "The script is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info-stealer that decrypts and harvests sensitive credentials, tokens, cookies, and files, then exfiltrates the data stealthily via webhooks and uploads. Its behaviors match typical malware patterns, and it poses a high security threat."
