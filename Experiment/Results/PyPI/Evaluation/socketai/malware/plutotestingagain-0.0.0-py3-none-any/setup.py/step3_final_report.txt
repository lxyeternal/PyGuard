  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the 'plutotesting' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from the setup script; no external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The dependencies list is processed during package installation; no runtime sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The setup script loads dependency names into the installer; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Listing standard library modules such as 'os', 'sys', 'json', 're', 'ctypes', 'time', 'shutil', 'zipfile', 'random', 'subprocess', 'sqlite3', 'urllib.request', 'base64' in 'install_requires' is unusual and indicates misconfiguration. Presence of cryptography libraries ('Crypto.Cipher', 'pycryptodome') without usage is also noteworthy but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration that improperly lists many standard library modules as dependencies, which is a common misconfiguration but not malicious. No dynamic code, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is evident. The cryptography libraries included are legitimate but unused, suggesting incomplete or incorrect dependency declaration. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as no malicious code or backdoors are detected. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the misconfiguration rather than a security threat. The code's structure is simple and static, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with the primary issue being the improper listing of standard library modules as dependencies. There is no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk stems from misconfiguration, not malicious activity. Correcting the dependencies list is recommended but does not impact security.",
