  "conclusion": "The code itself appears benign; the primary concern is the trustworthiness of the 'main' module and its 'GatherAll' function. Without inspecting 'main', the overall security risk remains moderate. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. It is recommended to review the source code of 'main.py' and 'GatherAll' before execution, especially in supply chain contexts."
