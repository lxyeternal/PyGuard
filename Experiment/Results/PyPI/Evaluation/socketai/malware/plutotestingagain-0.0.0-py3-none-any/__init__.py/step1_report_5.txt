{
  "purpose": "Call the GatherAll function from the main module",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' module; invocation of main.GatherAll()",
  "sinks": "The function call main.GatherAll() may lead to untrusted data handling depending on its implementation",
  "flows": "Import main -> call main.GatherAll()",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no visible suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets; potential concern depends on 'main' module's content",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'main' and invokes the function GatherAll() from it. Without the implementation details of 'main' or 'GatherAll()', it's impossible to determine if malicious behavior exists. The simplicity of the code suggests it delegates operations elsewhere. Given the lack of context, the potential for malicious activity is low, but the actual behavior depends entirely on the 'main' module's contents and what GatherAll() does when called.",
  "conclusion": "This code by itself does not show signs of malicious intent. Its safety depends on the implementation of the 'main' module and its GatherAll() function. No suspicious activity or anomalies are visible in this snippet.",
