  "purpose": "Minimal Python script importing 'main' and executing 'main.GatherAll()'.",
  "sources": "Import statement of 'main', call to 'main.GatherAll()'.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'GatherAll()' which may perform any actions depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Import 'main' -> call 'main.GatherAll()' -> execution of 'GatherAll' potentially affecting system or data.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns visible in the code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, with behavior entirely dependent on the external 'main' module's 'GatherAll' function. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are present in the snippet. The risk and malware assessments hinge on the implementation of 'GatherAll', which is unknown. The scores across the provided reports are cautious and consistent, with malware scores low (0 to 0.3) and risk scores moderate (0.2 to 0.45). Confidence levels are moderate, reflecting uncertainty due to lack of source code details. Given the minimal code, the likelihood of malicious intent is low, but the potential risk from executing untrusted external code warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears benign; the primary concern is the trustworthiness of the 'main' module and its 'GatherAll' function. Without inspecting 'main', the overall security risk remains moderate. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. It is recommended to review the source code of 'main.py' and 'GatherAll' before execution, especially in supply chain contexts.",
