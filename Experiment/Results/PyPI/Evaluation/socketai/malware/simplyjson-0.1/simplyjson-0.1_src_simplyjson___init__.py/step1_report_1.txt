{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious script designed to extract sensitive user information such as Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and files from various browsers and applications, then exfiltrate this data to a remote webhook and upload files to external servers.",
  "sources": "User input sources include log files, browser storage files, and environment variables. Data extraction occurs from local files such as login data, cookies, local state files, and logs. Network requests are made to fetch IP and geolocation data. Webhook URLs and external upload endpoints are used for exfiltration.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks occur via HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks and external file hosting services. Sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and personal files are sent without encryption or user consent.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local storage and log files into in-memory variables, then through functions that decrypt, process, and check validity, before being sent via network requests to remote endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URLs, functions to install dependencies silently, and extensive use of threading for parallel data collection. It also bypasses typical user prompts and avoids explicit user consent, indicating malicious intent. Use of obfuscated or misleading variable names (e.g., 'Tokens', 'Passw') and the presence of functions that collect data from multiple browsers and applications suggest malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script loads dependencies silently, accesses various browser profiles, and extracts tokens, passwords, cookies, and files. It decrypts stored credentials using Windows APIs and cryptography libraries. The data is then formatted into Discord embed payloads and sent to a hardcoded webhook URL. Additional functions zip and upload files from user directories, indicating data theft. The presence of functions to exfiltrate system information, user credentials, and files, coupled with minimal user interaction, confirms malicious intent. Overall, the script is designed for unauthorized access and exfiltration of personal user data without consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, intended for data theft and unauthorized surveillance. It systematically extracts sensitive information from user devices and exfiltrates it to external servers via webhooks and file uploads. Its structure, behaviors, and functions strongly indicate malicious activity with no legitimate user-facing purpose.",
