{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to extract sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from browsers, applications, and folders, then upload this data to a remote server via webhooks or file hosting services. It also includes mechanisms to gather system info, collect user tokens, and zip/steal files.",
  "sources": "Input sources include browser database files (Login Data, Cookies), local environment variables, user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents), and files within specific application directories and extensions. It also reads network responses and local system data for geolocation and system info.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to a remote webhook URL via POST requests, uploaded to external file hosting services (gofile.io), and processed for further malicious use. The code also attempts to execute commands (taskkill, pip installs), which can be considered a sink if misused, but primarily it sends data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like browser and application files -> decryption/reading functions -> aggregation into strings or files -> transmission via HTTP requests or uploads. Specific flows include extracting tokens/passwords/cookies -> validating tokens -> sending user info and credentials to the webhook and file hosting services.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains several suspicious patterns: automatic installation of dependencies, usage of hardcoded webhook URL, collection of tokens/passwords/cookies from multiple sources, use of obfuscated/decrypted tokens, multi-threaded file zipping, and uploading user data without user consent. The code also kills processes and uploads files from system directories, indicating malicious intent. The use of placeholder URLs (e.g., 'https://google.com') for zip links suggests incomplete or placeholder code.",
  "analysis": "The script actively searches user directories for sensitive data like tokens, passwords, and cookies from browsers and applications such as Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, Discord, Telegram, and gaming platforms. It decrypts stored credentials using master keys, gathers user info, and verifies tokens. The data is then uploaded to a Discord webhook or file hosting site, indicating data exfiltration. It also collects files matching specific keywords and directories, zips them, and uploads links. The code includes threading for parallel processing and kills processes associated with known applications before zipping files, which is typical of malware aimed at stealth and comprehensive data theft. Hardcoded webhook URL, dependency installation via subprocess, and broad system access points reinforce malicious intent. Overall, the code is crafted to stealthily harvest sensitive user information and files, then exfiltrate them remotely.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates high malicious intent, functioning as a data-stealing malware targeting browser credentials, tokens, cookies, system info, and user files. It exfiltrates data without user consent, employs techniques to evade detection, and actively kills processes to facilitate file access. It should be considered highly dangerous and should not be used or distributed.",
