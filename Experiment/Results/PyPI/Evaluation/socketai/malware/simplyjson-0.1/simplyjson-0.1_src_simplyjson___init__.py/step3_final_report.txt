{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a credential and data stealer, extracting tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from browsers and applications, decrypting sensitive data, and exfiltrating via webhooks and uploads. It employs stealth techniques such as process termination, threading, silent dependency installation, and data compression to evade detection.",
  "sources": "Browser storage directories, login databases, environment variables, user directories, and local files containing credentials, tokens, cookies, and system info.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to hardcoded Discord webhook URLs, external file hosting services, and network requests for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Local data collection from browsers and applications → decryption of stored credentials using Windows APIs → aggregation of tokens, passwords, cookies, and files → data transmission via webhooks and file uploads.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, silent dependency installation, process termination commands, extensive threading for parallel data collection, minimal obfuscation with misleading variable names, no user consent prompts.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically harvests user credentials, tokens, cookies, and files from multiple browsers and applications. It decrypts protected data using Windows API calls and cryptography modules. Data is then exfiltrated via a hardcoded webhook and external uploads. The code employs threading for efficiency, kills processes to evade detection, and zips files for transfer. No significant obfuscation or packing is present, but variable names and structure may mislead. The absence of user prompts indicates malicious intent. Overall, the code exhibits high malicious activity with extensive data theft and exfiltration techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a highly malicious credential and data stealer, employing multiple stealth and exfiltration techniques. It operates without user consent, targeting browser and application data, decrypting sensitive information, and exfiltrating via hardcoded webhooks and external servers. The scores for malware and security risk are justified at 1, with a low obfuscation score of 0.2 reflecting minimal obfuscation patterns present.",
