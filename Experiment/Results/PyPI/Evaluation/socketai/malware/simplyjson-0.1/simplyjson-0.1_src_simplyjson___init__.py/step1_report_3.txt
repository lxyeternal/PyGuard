{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a malicious information stealer designed to extract sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, browser data, and files from various applications and browsers, then exfiltrate this data via webhooks and file uploads.",
  "sources": "Data sources include user input (logs, local storage files, databases), environment variables (e.g., APPDATA, LOCALAPPDATA), and local files/directories related to browsers, Discord, Steam, wallets, and other applications.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration occurs through HTTP requests to Discord webhooks, uploading files to external servers (gofile.io), and potentially via other HTTP requests using the 'requests' library and URL open calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like local storage, database files, and logs to processing functions that decrypt, parse, and collect data, then it is sent via HTTP requests or saved to files for later upload to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URLs, silent installation of dependencies, decryption of Windows protected data, obfuscation-like patterns, extensive use of threading for parallel operations, and aggressive file scanning across multiple user directories. The code also kills processes, zips files, and uploads potentially sensitive data. The use of 'taskkill' commands and the suppression of errors suggests an attempt to hide operations.",
  "analysis": "The script is crafted to harvest various user credentials, cookies, tokens, and files from multiple browsers, applications, and directories. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows' Protected Storage APIs, gathers Discord tokens and user info, and uploads everything to external servers. The code employs multiple threads to speed up operations, stealthily kills processes, compresses data, and uploads it—all typical of malware designed for data theft. The inclusion of hardcoded webhook URLs and external upload endpoints further confirms malicious intent. The script also contains obfuscated or misleading parts, like random function names and redundant checks, to complicate analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, intended to steal user credentials, tokens, cookies, files, and other sensitive data, then exfiltrate it via webhooks and file uploads. It employs multiple anti-analysis techniques and uses Windows API calls to decrypt protected data, indicating a clear malicious purpose.",
