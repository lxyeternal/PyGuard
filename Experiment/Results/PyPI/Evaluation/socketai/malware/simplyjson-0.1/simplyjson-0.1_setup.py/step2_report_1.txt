  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools.\n- No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, or network operations are present.\n- The package metadata appears legitimate, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors.\n- The only potentially suspicious element is the placeholder URL ('https://github.com/'), which is common in sample code but not inherently malicious.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, which aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n- The scores are consistent across reports.\n\n**Risk Scores:**\n- All reports assign securityRisk=0, which is reasonable given the lack of any malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- The overall confidence is high (1), indicating strong agreement.\n\n**Potential issues or points of contention:**\n- The reports are very conservative, considering the code is purely declarative and standard.\n- There are no claims or evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or supply chain risks.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores given are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- I agree with the provided scores:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n- Given the nature of the code, I would also assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - risk: 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are accurate and justified based on the analysis.",
