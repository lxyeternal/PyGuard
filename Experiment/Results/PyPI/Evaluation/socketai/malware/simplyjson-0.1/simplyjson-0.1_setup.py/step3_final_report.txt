  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields in setup(), including name, version, license, author, author_email, url, keywords, and install_requires; the find_packages('src') call for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network operations, or code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is declarative and does not process untrusted input or perform data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with a placeholder URL and standard structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project, with static metadata and no dynamic or malicious components. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The placeholder URL is common and not suspicious. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard package configuration script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified.",
