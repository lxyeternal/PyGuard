{
  "purpose": "Evaluate the security posture of the code that imports and calls 'type_check' from 'pytoolib', focusing on potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via the static string 'boolean' passed to 'type_check'. No other data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The function call 'type_check('boolean')' could be a sink if 'type_check' performs malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication, depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the static input 'boolean' to the 'type_check' function. The behavior of 'type_check' determines if any further malicious or security-impacting actions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present in this minimal snippet. The concern hinges on the external 'pytoolib' library's implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing 'type_check' from 'pytoolib' and calling it with a static string. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are visible. The security implications depend entirely on the behavior of 'pytoolib.type_check'. Given the lack of evidence, the code appears benign. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as there are no malicious indicators. The risk score is low (0.1-0.2), reflecting uncertainty about the external dependency's trustworthiness. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.8-0.9). The main concern is the external library's implementation, which cannot be evaluated here. If 'pytoolib' is trusted, the code is safe; if not, potential risks exist. No obfuscation is detected, and the code structure is simple and clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious activity evident. The primary risk stems from the external 'pytoolib' library, which cannot be assessed here. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the available information.",
