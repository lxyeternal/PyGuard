{
  "purpose": "The code imports a specific function 'type_check' from an external module 'pytoolib' and calls it with the argument 'boolean'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it only imports a function and invokes it with a string argument.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The imported function 'type_check' is called with the string 'boolean', but the internal behavior of 'type_check' is unknown from this code alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself is straightforward, but reliance on an external module 'pytoolib' and its function 'type_check' raises questions. Without knowing its implementation, it could potentially perform malicious actions, such as logging, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No obfuscation or suspicious language features are evident in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "This snippet imports a function from an external module and calls it with a simple string argument. The overall security risk heavily depends on the implementation of 'type_check' within 'pytoolib'. If 'type_check' is benign, then this code is harmless; if malicious, it could perform undesired actions. The minimal code offers no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but external dependencies are a point of concern.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code, there is no clear malicious intent. However, because the behavior of 'type_check' in 'pytoolib' is unknown, there is a potential risk depending on its implementation. Caution should be exercised if 'pytoolib' is from untrusted sources.",
