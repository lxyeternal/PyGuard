{
  "purpose": "Import a function named 'type_check' from the 'pytoolib' module and call it with the string 'boolean'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'module.pytoolib' and the call to 'type_check' with a string argument.",
  "sinks": "The 'type_check' function is called with a string input; potential sink depends on the implementation of 'type_check'.",
  "flows": "Input string 'boolean' flows into the 'type_check' function; potential output or effect depends on its implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures or hardcoded secrets. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function from a module and invokes it with a string argument. The security implications hinge on the implementation of 'type_check' within 'pytoolib'. Since 'pytoolib' is an external dependency, its internal behavior is unknown, but the invocation appears benign as it is merely a type check. There is no evidence of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple import and function call with a string argument, which appears benign. Without access to 'pytoolib's implementation, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
