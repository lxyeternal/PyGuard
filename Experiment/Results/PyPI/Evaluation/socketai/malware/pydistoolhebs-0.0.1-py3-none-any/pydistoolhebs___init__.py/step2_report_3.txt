  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the issues, their reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is minimal, straightforward, and involves importing and calling `type_check` with a string argument `'boolean'`.\n- The core concern hinges on the implementation of `pytoolib.type_check`. Since it's an external dependency, its internal behavior is unknown.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns is present in the code snippet itself.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the assessments that there's no direct malicious activity observable here.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal risk based on the provided code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code itself does not contain any issues. It is a simple import and function call.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** No errors or flaws are evident in the code snippet.\n- **Scores:**\n  - The malware scores are 0, which seems appropriate given the code.\n  - The security risk scores are low, consistent with the reports.\n  - The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n### Critical points:\n- The main concern is the external dependency `pytoolib`. Without its implementation, we cannot definitively assess the risk.\n- The reports correctly acknowledge this uncertainty and assign low confidence scores (0.4 to 0.9).\n- The reasoning that the code appears benign is sound, given the simplicity.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The only potential inconsistency is the report with a confidence of 0.4 (Report 4). Given the simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns, I would suggest increasing confidence slightly, perhaps to 0.7, unless there's external information indicating malicious behavior.\n- The malware score remains appropriate at 0; no change needed.\n- The security risk scores are reasonable, but if `pytoolib.type_check` is from an untrusted source, a slightly higher risk score (e.g., 0.3) could be justified. However, given the current low scores, it's acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** Given the uncertainty about `pytoolib.type_check`, a conservative estimate would be around 0.2–0.3, but the current scores are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is benign and straightforward.\n- The main unknown is the implementation of `pytoolib.type_check`.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable, with minor room for increased confidence if more info about `pytoolib` becomes available.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (slightly conservative, considering dependency trustworthiness)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the actual code. No signs of malicious activity are evident, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
