{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious credential and data stealer targeting various browsers, messaging apps, and other software to extract tokens, passwords, cookies, and sensitive files, then exfiltrates the data via Discord webhook or file uploads.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, browser profile directories, log files, SQLite databases, local state files, and user directories for tokens, passwords, cookies, and files. It also fetches external IP and geolocation data, and gathers tokens from log files and cookies.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via Discord webhook (hook URL hardcoded), uploaded to anonymous file hosting services (gofile.io, anonfiles), and the information includes tokens, passwords, cookies, user info, and potentially sensitive files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as log files, browser storage, and user directories through functions that decode, decrypt, and collect tokens, passwords, cookies, and files, then streams the data to external URLs or uploads, notably via requests and URL requests. The flow includes token validation, decryption, and exfiltration steps.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes hardcoded webhook URL, dynamic installation of dependencies, multiple obfuscation-like structures, use of non-standard variable names, and functions that collect sensitive info from multiple applications. It employs threading for concurrent data collection. The presence of functions for token validation, decryption, and exfiltration, plus extensive access to user data, indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code initiates by ensuring dependencies like requests and pycryptodome are installed, then collects external IP and geolocation info. It includes functions for decrypting data, collecting Discord tokens, billing info, user badges, and friend lists. It also gathers browser passwords and cookies from Chrome, Edge, Opera, Yandex, Brave, and others, using SQLite database access with decryption via Windows API. It extracts tokens from logs and directories, and captures sensitive files from common user directories like Desktop, Downloads, and Documents based on keywords. The data is compiled into formatted messages and uploaded to file hosting services, and notifications are sent via a Discord webhook, indicating exfiltration of personal data. The code’s structure, combined with the focus on extracting credentials, tokens, cookies, and sensitive files, clearly indicates malicious behavior intended for theft and unauthorized access.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a highly malicious credential, token, and data stealer designed to exfiltrate personal, financial, and application data. It employs obfuscation techniques, extensive access to sensitive user data, and multiple exfiltration channels, constituting a significant security threat.",
