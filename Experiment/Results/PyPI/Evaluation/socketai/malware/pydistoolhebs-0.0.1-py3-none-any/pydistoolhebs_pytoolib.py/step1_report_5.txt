{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed for data theft and exfiltration, targeting sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from user systems, and reporting this data via Discord webhooks and file uploads.",
  "sources": "Sources include environment variables, local files (e.g., browser login data, cookies, local state files), input from user log files, and network requests to external APIs and services.",
  "sinks": "Sinks involve sending data to Discord webhooks, uploading files to external servers (gofile.io, anonfiles), and executing system commands to terminate processes and manipulate files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (local files, environment variables, logs, network responses) to sinks (webhooks, file uploads). For example, tokens and passwords are extracted from files, decrypted, then exfiltrated via HTTP requests. Cookies and files are zipped and uploaded, while system commands kill processes to ensure access.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs several suspicious activities: dynamically installing modules, extensive use of threading for concurrent data collection, reading sensitive browser data, decrypting encrypted credentials, gathering Discord tokens and user info, and exfiltrating data via multiple external endpoints. The script also kills browser processes, manipulates files in user directories, and uploads sensitive information to third-party servers. The use of hardcoded webhook URLs and the specific targeting of various credential stores indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive credential stealer designed for malicious purposes. It automates the collection of Discord tokens, browser credentials, cookies, and other sensitive data from multiple browsers and applications. It decrypts stored data, collects system info, and uploads the collected data through various channels. The code also includes functions to gather files matching specific keywords, zip them, and upload to external servers. Its structure relies heavily on threading for parallel processing, and it kills processes to access files that might be otherwise locked. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL, functions to decrypt sensitive data, and the manner of exfiltration strongly suggest malicious behavior. The module attempts to stay undetected by hiding its activities and automating repeated data collection cycles.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a highly malicious credential and data stealer that exfiltrates user information, tokens, cookies, and files from infected systems. It uses multiple techniques to decrypt and access sensitive data, employs threading for efficiency, and uploads data to external servers, confirming its malicious nature. Its actions pose significant security risks and it should be considered malware.",
