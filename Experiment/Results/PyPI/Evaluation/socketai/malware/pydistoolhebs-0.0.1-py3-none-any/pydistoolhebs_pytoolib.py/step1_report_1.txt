  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from user systems, and then exfiltrate this data by uploading it to external servers, primarily Discord webhooks and anonymous file hosting services.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input and data from various locations including system environment variables, browser storage databases (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Yandex, Opera), Discord local storage, log files, and cookies. It also accesses local files such as 'Login Data' and 'Local State' files for credentials.",
  "sinks": "The extracted data (tokens, passwords, cookies, files) is sent via HTTP POST requests to external URLs including a Discord webhook and anonymous file hosting services (gofile.io, transfer.sh). The code also executes system commands and kills processes which could disrupt system operation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source locations (browser databases, system files, environment variables) to processing functions (decryption, parsing), and then to sinks where it is uploaded or transmitted externally. For example, tokens extracted from log files or browser storage are validated and then sent to the webhook or uploaded files. Credentials and cookies are exfiltrated similarly.",
  "anomalies": "The code exhibits multiple suspicious behaviors, including: automatic installation of dependencies without user consent; usage of hardcoded webhook URL; decryption of stored credentials and tokens; process termination commands; downloading and executing data from potentially malicious sources; extensive data collection from user browsers and system files; obfuscated or misleading variable names; and comprehensive exfiltration routines. The code also attempts to collect system info, browser data, and sensitive files systematically, which is characteristic of malicious payloads. The code has no clear legitimate purpose and operates covertly.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a credential, token, and data stealer targeting user browsers, Discord, and other applications. It begins by importing various modules, some of which are installed automatically if missing. It contains functions to decrypt stored browser credentials using system APIs (CryptUnprotectData), extract tokens from log files, and collect cookies and passwords from browsers. The code retrieves user info, including IP and country, and exfiltrates via a Discord webhook with detailed embeds including token and system info. It also collects files matching specific keywords from user directories, zips them, and uploads to anonymous file hosts, then reports links. The script terminates processes related to targeted applications to prevent interference, then gathers and uploads data systematically. The use of hardcoded webhook, process termination commands, and extensive data collection strongly suggest malicious intent. The code is obfuscated in logic and naming but remains readable enough to recognize its harmful pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a highly suspicious credential and data theft malware. It systematically exfiltrates sensitive user data, including tokens, passwords, cookies, and files, to external servers. Its behaviors such as automatic dependency installation, process termination, decryption routines, and data uploads confirm malicious intent. It should be considered malicious and dangerous to system security.",
