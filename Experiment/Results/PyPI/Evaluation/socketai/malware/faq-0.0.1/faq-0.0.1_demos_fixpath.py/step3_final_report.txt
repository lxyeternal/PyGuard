  "purpose": "Modify sys.path to prioritize local modules during import, facilitating local development or testing.",
  "sources": "The code reads __file__ to determine its directory, then constructs the parent directory path.",
  "sinks": "sys.path.insert(0, local_express_module) adds the directory to the module search path, influencing import resolution.",
  "flows": "Source (__file__ and directory computation) -> sink (sys.path modification) affecting module import behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward path manipulation without obfuscation or external inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code computes the parent directory of the current file and inserts it at the beginning of sys.path, ensuring local modules are prioritized. This is a common pattern in development environments. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The code is simple, clear, and intended for local module overriding. No security vulnerabilities or suspicious activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for local development, and poses no security threat. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (around 0.1-0.2) are appropriate. The reports are accurate and require no modifications.",
