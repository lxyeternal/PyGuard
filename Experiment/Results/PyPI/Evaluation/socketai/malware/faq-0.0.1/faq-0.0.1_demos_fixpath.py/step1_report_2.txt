{
  "purpose": "Adjust the Python module search path to prioritize local source code for the 'express' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file's directory (__file__) and modifies sys.path to include its parent directory.",
  "sinks": "Modifying sys.path influences module import behavior, but does not directly lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The script constructs a path based on __file__, inserts it into sys.path, affecting subsequent import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically alters sys.path to prioritize local modules, which is common in development environments but can be exploited if misused. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and os.path functions, computes the parent directory of the current file, and inserts this directory at the beginning of sys.path. This ensures that when 'import express' is called later, it prefers the local source rather than an installed package. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. It serves a development purpose and does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily intended to facilitate local development by overriding module import paths. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
