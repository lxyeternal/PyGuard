  "purpose": "Adjust the Python import path to prioritize local source code in the 'express' directory.",
  "sources": "Reading the current file's directory (__file__), reading and joining paths, and modifying sys.path.",
  "sinks": "Modifying sys.path to influence module import behavior.",
  "flows": "From reading __file__ and path operations to sys.path modification.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically modifies sys.path to prioritize local modules, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to prepend the parent directory of the current script to sys.path, ensuring local 'express' source code is imported over installed versions. This is a common technique in development environments. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The only noteworthy aspect is the manipulation of the import path, which can be risky if misused but is not malicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for local development and does not contain malicious behavior. It merely alters the import path to prioritize local modules, which is not inherently suspicious.",
