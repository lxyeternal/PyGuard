{
  "purpose": "Adjusts the Python module search path to prioritize local source code for the 'express' module during import.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own file location (__file__), the filesystem to determine the parent directory, and modifies sys.path.",
  "sinks": "The modification of sys.path affects module import behavior but does not directly lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Code reads its own location -> determines parent directory -> inserts directory at start of sys.path -> influences subsequent module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard practice for local development or module overriding.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system modules to manipulate the Python import path. It calculates the parent directory of the current script and prepends it to sys.path, ensuring local modules are prioritized during import statements. This is a common pattern in development environments to override installed packages with local source code. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection is present. The license comment indicates proper attribution and licensing, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup for local module management without any malicious behavior. It does not pose a security risk or facilitate supply chain attacks.",
