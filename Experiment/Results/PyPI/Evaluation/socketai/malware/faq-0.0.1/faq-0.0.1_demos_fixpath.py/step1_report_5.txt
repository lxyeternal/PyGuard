  "purpose": "Modify the Python module search path to prioritize local source code for the 'express' module.",
  "sources": "Reading the current script file's directory (__file__), reading and joining path components.",
  "sinks": "sys.path modification affects module import behavior, but no direct untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The script reads its own file path, computes a directory, and inserts it into sys.path to influence module resolution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; the path modification is straightforward, intended for development or testing.",
  "analysis": "The code adds the parent directory of the current script to sys.path to ensure that local source code for 'express' is imported preferentially. It uses standard library functions for path manipulation and performs no network operations, no credential handling, and no dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical development practice to ensure local module resolution and poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
