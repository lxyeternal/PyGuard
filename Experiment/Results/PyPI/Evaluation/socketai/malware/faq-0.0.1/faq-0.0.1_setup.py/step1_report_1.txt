  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'faq', designed to package and distribute a terminal text coloring library.",
  "sources": [
    "Read operations in read_file() function for reading __init__.py and README.rst files.",
    "Execution of dynamically decoded and compiled code via base64-encoded strings in the initial print statements."
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "exec() calls on dynamically decoded and compiled code, executing arbitrary code within the script.",
    "Potentially malicious code executed through the base64-encoded payloads which may contain harmful instructions."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Code reads the __init__.py and README.rst files for versioning and description.",
    "Base64-encoded strings are decoded, compiled, and executed via exec(), running potentially malicious code.",
    "The setup() function is called with package metadata, which appears legitimate and standard."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of __import__('builtins').exec() combined with compile() and base64 decoding of obfuscated strings at script start.",
    "Presence of two identical blocks of base64-encoded code that are decoded and executed, which is unusual and suspicious.",
    "Obfuscated code blocks executing unknown code snippets, likely to hide malicious payloads."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks such as reading files and extracting version info, which are benign. However, at the very beginning, it executes two base64-encoded payloads via exec(). These payloads are decoded, compiled, and run dynamically, which is a common technique for hiding malicious behavior. Since the base64 strings are identical and contain obfuscated code, this strongly indicates malicious intent, possibly downloading or executing harmful code at installation time. The rest of the script appears typical for a setup.py file, with no other suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, malicious code executed during import, likely intended to perform unauthorized actions or further compromise the environment. The presence of repeated, encoded payloads executing via exec() is a significant security concern, overshadowing the benign package setup logic.",
