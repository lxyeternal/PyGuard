  "conclusion": "The code contains highly suspicious, obfuscated payloads executed during package setup, strongly indicating malicious intent. The use of exec() on decoded base64 strings is a red flag for potential malware, such as remote code execution or data exfiltration. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect the high severity of the security risk."
