{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'faq', including reading package metadata, version, and description, and executing dynamically decoded and executed code during import.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded strings decoded and executed at import; reading files for version and description; reading environment variables indirectly via file reads.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically decoded code, which could be malicious; reading files for version info; reading package files and README.",
  "flows": "Decoded code executes immediately upon import, which could include malicious code; file reading for version and description is benign; setup configuration is standard.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded, dynamically executed code at import time; code executes potentially arbitrary code decoded from base64 strings; the code includes obfuscated import and execution pattern; no explicit input validation; embedded code appears to fetch external resources.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and handles package setup. Notably, it executes code decoded from base64 strings that are executed immediately during import, which is suspicious. These strings decode to code that imports 'templefile' and performs HTTP requests to external URLs, suggesting possible malicious behavior like data exfiltration or remote code execution. The rest of the code appears to be standard setup procedures, reading version info and long description files. The immediate execution of base64-decoded code is a strong anomaly indicating malicious intent or sabotage. The setup process itself is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically decoded code executed during import, which likely performs malicious actions such as external HTTP requests. This suggests a high likelihood of malicious behavior embedded within the package. The overall security risk is high due to the immediate execution of external code, and the malware score is accordingly high.",
