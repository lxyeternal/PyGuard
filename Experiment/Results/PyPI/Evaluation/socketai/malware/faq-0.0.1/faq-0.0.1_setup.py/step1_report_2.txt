{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up a Python package named 'faq', including reading package version, description, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Base64 encoded strings decoded and executed at the beginning; reading files such as '__init__.py' and 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically decoded code; reading files; potentially using 'exec' on decoded code.",
  "flows": "Decoded base64 strings are executed via 'exec', which then run additional code that may perform malicious actions; file reading functions are used for package info.",
  "anomalies": "Initial code executes dynamically decoded base64-encoded code which could be malicious; the base64 strings decode to code that performs further 'exec' calls; multiple 'exec' on decoded code introduces high risk; no clear benign purpose for these 'exec' calls.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing modules and defining package metadata. Notably, it executes two large base64-encoded strings using 'exec', which decodes into code that performs further 'exec' operations. This pattern indicates obfuscation or malicious intent. The decoded code likely executes additional code that could be malicious, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The rest of the script reads package files and sets up package metadata in a standard way. The use of 'exec' on decoded strings is a common tactic for hiding malicious payloads. Given the high risk associated with executing dynamically decoded code, the overall security posture is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated, dynamically decoded code executed via 'exec', which is highly suspicious. The use of 'exec' on base64-encoded payloads indicates malicious intent or at least an attempt to hide malicious behavior. The remaining setup code is standard but overshadowed by the potentially harmful code execution at the beginning. Overall, this package is highly risky and likely malicious.",
