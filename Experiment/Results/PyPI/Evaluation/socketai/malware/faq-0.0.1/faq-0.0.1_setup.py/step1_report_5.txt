    "Execution of dynamically decoded code without any apparent validation or restriction"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script primarily functions as a package setup script. The majority of its code is standard for Python packaging, including reading version info, reading README, and configuring setup(). However, two base64-encoded strings are decoded and executed immediately via exec(), which is suspicious. These strings are decoded from base64 and then run as code, which could contain malicious logic, backdoors, or unwanted behaviors. Since the actual code within these strings is not visible directly, there's a significant risk that malicious code is embedded and executed at setup time. The rest of the code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The presence of two decoded and executed base64 strings during setup is a major concern. These could contain malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The rest of the script is typical for a setup process, but the dynamic execution of encoded code suggests potential malicious intent or sabotage. The overall security risk is high due to this, and caution should be exercised before using this package.",
