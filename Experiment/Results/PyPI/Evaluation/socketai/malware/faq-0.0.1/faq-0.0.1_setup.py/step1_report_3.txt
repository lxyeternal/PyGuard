  "purpose": "The script is for setting up a Python package named 'faq', including reading metadata and packaging information, as well as executing dynamically decoded code.",
  "sources": [
    "The base64-encoded strings executed via exec() at the beginning of the script.",
    "File reading functions accessing 'faq/__init__.py' and 'README.rst'."
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "The exec() calls executing decoded code from base64 strings.",
    "Reading files 'faq/__init__.py' and 'README.rst' which are standard for setup scripts."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Base64-encoded strings decoded and executed, potentially running arbitrary code.",
    "Reading files 'faq/__init__.py' and 'README.rst' and parsing version info."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Execution of obfuscated code via base64-decoded exec() calls at the start.",
    "Use of 'compile' and 'exec' to run dynamically decoded code, which is unusual and suspicious.",
    "Presence of print statements and dynamic code execution that do not serve a typical setup script purpose.",
    "No clear comments explaining the purpose of the obfuscated code."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code includes standard setup procedures such as reading package metadata and version info. However, it contains two obfuscated code blocks where base64-encoded strings are decoded, compiled, and executed via exec(). These strings decode to code that imports modules, makes HTTP requests, and potentially executes further code, indicating an attempt to run hidden or malicious code. The code's purpose appears to be obscured, and the dynamic execution is a common indicator of malicious intent or sabotage. No other suspicious activity, such as hardcoded credentials or malicious system commands, is evident outside these obfuscated sections.",
  "conclusion": "The script's core setup functionality is standard, but the presence of obfuscated code executed dynamically strongly suggests malicious intent or sabotage. The code likely aims to hide malicious payloads or tracking mechanisms. Caution is advised before using or distributing this package.",
