{
  "purpose": "Provides Windows console manipulation functions such as setting text attributes, cursor position, and console title using ctypes and Windows API calls.",
  "sources": "Reads input from standard handles (_GetStdHandle), particularly STDOUT and STDERR, and uses Windows API functions to modify console properties.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Windows API functions that alter console display, cursor position, and title, potentially affecting console output appearance.",
  "flows": "Input handles (from _GetStdHandle) flow into API functions like _SetConsoleTextAttribute, _SetConsoleCursorPosition, and _SetConsoleTitleW to modify console state.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and standard for console control.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally loads Windows DLLs and defines functions for console manipulation. It uses standard API calls without any obfuscation or malicious logic. The functions are designed for legitimate console management tasks. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code's purpose aligns with typical console utilities, and no security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows console utility module with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. It poses minimal security risk and is safe for use. The scores across reports are appropriate and consistent with its benign functionality.",
