  "purpose": "This code provides functions for interacting with Windows console features such as screen buffer info, text attributes, cursor position, and console title setting.",
  "sources": "Imports of ctypes and windll functions for Windows API calls; reading console handles and system info.",
  "sinks": "Setting console text attributes, cursor position, console title, and output characters, which could be manipulated for visual disruptions or obfuscation.",
  "flows": "Function calls to Windows API functions from sources (ctypes imports, handle retrieval) to sinks (API functions like SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, SetConsoleTitle).",
  "anomalies": "The code includes extensive handling of Windows console API calls, with some adjustments for cursor positions, which could be exploited to alter console appearance or mislead users. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. No code injection or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes Windows console API functions, providing utilities to get buffer info, set text attributes, cursor position, fill output characters, and set console title. It performs environment checks and defines helper functions to interact with the console. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected. The functions appear intended for legitimate console manipulation, with careful handling of API parameters. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for Windows console manipulation, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates within the expected scope of console customization functions.",
