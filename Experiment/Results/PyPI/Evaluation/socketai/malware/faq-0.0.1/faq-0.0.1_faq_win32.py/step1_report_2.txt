{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for interacting with Windows console APIs, including functions to get console info, set text attributes, cursor position, fill output, and set the console title.",
  "sources": "The code reads system handles via _GetStdHandle, and reads console buffer info via _GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo. It also reads the console title string input in SetConsoleTitle.",
  "sinks": "Functions that modify console state: SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, FillConsoleOutputCharacterA, FillConsoleOutputAttribute, SetConsoleTitleW.",
  "flows": "Input from environment or user (console title string). These are passed to Windows API functions to modify console appearance and behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic imports and function definitions conditioned on the environment, which could be seen as unnecessary complexity but not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. No obfuscation or malicious system calls are present. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious side-effects are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily interfaces with Windows console APIs to retrieve and modify console properties. It conditionally imports ctypes, defines structures, and wraps Windows API calls with appropriate argument and return types. The functions are standard for console manipulation. No data is sent over network, no system files are altered, and no covert data collection mechanisms are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain any malicious payloads. It appears to be legitimate utility code for console control.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard Windows console API interface, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It solely interacts with console properties for display purposes. No security risks are identified. The code is safe and intended for legitimate use.",
