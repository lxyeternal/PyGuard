{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface to control Windows console text attributes, cursor position, screen and line clearing, and title setting.",
  "sources": "Imports a local module . (likely win32), calls functions from win32 (e.g., GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleTitle).",
  "sinks": "Calls to win32.SetConsoleTextAttribute and win32.SetConsoleTitle that modify console appearance; potentially sensitive if misused, but these are standard API calls for console management.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., color codes, positions, style) flow into methods that invoke win32 console functions to modify console state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution. All functions perform expected console operations. No network operations or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly manages console attributes, cursor, and screen content on Windows via win32 API calls. It uses standard console handling functions for position, attributes, clearing, and title setting. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or external data transmissions are present. The code is straightforward, with clear purpose and no anomalies or obfuscated patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Windows console management library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected operations for console manipulation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns detected.",
