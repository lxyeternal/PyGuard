  "purpose": "This code provides a Windows console interface with functions to change text colors, styles, cursor position, clear screen/lines, and set the console title.",
  "sources": "Reads console buffer info, cursor position, and console output attributes via win32 API functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses win32 API functions to set console text attributes, cursor position, clear screen/lines, and set console title.",
  "flows": "Gets console info from win32.GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo → modifies attributes or position based on user input → applies changes via win32.SetConsoleTextAttribute, win32.SetConsoleCursorPosition, win32.FillConsoleOutputCharacter/Attribute, win32.SetConsoleTitle.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious data leaks, and no network activity or file operations suggesting malicious intent. The code solely interfaces with Windows console API for display and cursor management.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts exclusively with the Windows console API (win32), performing display styling, cursor movement, and screen clearing operations. These functions are standard for terminal management and do not perform any network, file, or data exfiltration activities. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are detected. The functions are straightforward wrappers around win32 API calls, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The code is well-structured, and there are no anomalies indicative of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows console interface utility without malicious intent. It performs standard terminal operations and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behaviors. It is safe from supply chain attacks or sabotage within its scope.",
