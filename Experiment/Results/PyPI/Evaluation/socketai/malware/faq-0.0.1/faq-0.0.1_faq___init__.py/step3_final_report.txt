{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization module for a terminal styling library, importing functions and constants related to ANSI escape sequences, cursor control, and text styles.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: initialise, ansi, ansitowin32",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network operations, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules to module namespace; no data flow from external sources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__-like module that imports functions and classes for terminal styling and sets a version string. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. The structure is typical for a library's initialization file, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for a terminal styling library, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
