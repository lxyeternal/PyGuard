{
  "purpose": "This code initializes, wraps, and manages the standard output and error streams with ANSI to Win32 conversion, primarily to enhance console output formatting on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Reads system stdout and stderr streams, and environment variables through sys module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies sys.stdout and sys.stderr streams, replacing them with wrapped versions.",
  "flows": "Reads from sys.stdout/sys.stderr -> wrap_stream -> AnsiToWin32 object -> possibly modifies the stream.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external communications are present. The code dynamically replaces system streams but does not seem to leak data or perform malicious actions. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages output streams for console formatting. It wraps sys.stdout and sys.stderr with an ANSI to Win32 converter when enabled, using standard library modules such as atexit and contextlib. The functions include initialization, deinitialization, reinitialization, and stream wrapping. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns are identified. The only modification involves replacing system output streams with wrapped objects, which is standard for console enhancement libraries. The code has no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for handling ANSI escape sequences on Windows terminals. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It may modify system output streams for formatting purposes but does not perform any harmful actions.",
