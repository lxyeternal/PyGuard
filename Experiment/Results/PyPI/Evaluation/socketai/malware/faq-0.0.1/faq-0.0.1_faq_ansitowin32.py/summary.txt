  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate terminal utility for handling ANSI sequences, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified, reflecting minimal potential for misuse but no inherent threat. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is 0, consistent with the code's clarity and purpose."
