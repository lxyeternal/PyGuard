{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape sequences for coloring and formatting terminal output, including cursor control and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or external system interactions detected.",
  "flows": "The code constructs ANSI escape sequences through functions and class attributes, but no untrusted data flows from input to output.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and standard for terminal color handling; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures. No obfuscation, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes for generating ANSI escape sequences for text colors, background colors, styles, and cursor movements. Functions like 'code_to_chars' assemble escape sequences from codes. Classes initialize attributes with escape sequences based on their numerical codes. The implementation is consistent, well-structured, and uses standard ANSI codes. No external inputs, network communications, or file operations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code appears to be a utility library for terminal styling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility for terminal ANSI styling with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not process untrusted input or perform external actions that could be malicious.",
