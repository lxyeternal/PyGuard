  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward utility library for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling.\n- No external input, data processing, or external system interactions are present.\n- No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code only defines constants, functions, and classes for terminal control sequences.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  No. The code is static, well-structured, and standard for terminal styling.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None noted in the reports. The implementation appears correct and conventional.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with their analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score justification:**  \n  The code is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors; 0 is justified.\n\n- **Risk score justification:**  \n  The overall security risk is minimal, given the code's purpose and behavior; 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- **Any unreasonable scores?**  \n  No. All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Any need to adjust scores?**  \n  No. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified.\n\n- **Additional comments:**  \n  The code is a benign utility library for terminal styling. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Personal estimate (post-review):\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate; the code is safe, non-obfuscated, and has no malware or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
