{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling, including colors, styles, and cursor movements.",
  "sources": "Functions accepting parameters such as 'title', 'n', 'x', 'y' to generate escape sequences; class attributes defining ANSI codes used during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Generated strings are returned and typically printed or used in terminal output; no untrusted data processing occurs within the code itself.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions, which concatenate them with escape sequence constants to produce styled terminal control strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static, straightforward, and uses standard Python constructs without obfuscation or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes for ANSI escape sequences, converting numeric codes into escape strings upon object instantiation. No external input, network, or file operations are present. Functions generate escape sequences based on parameters, but do not process untrusted data. The implementation is standard for terminal styling utilities, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility library for terminal styling using ANSI escape sequences. It contains no malware, no obfuscation, and poses no security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
