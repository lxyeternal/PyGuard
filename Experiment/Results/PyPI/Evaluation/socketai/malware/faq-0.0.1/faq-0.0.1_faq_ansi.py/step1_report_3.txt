{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting and cursor control, such as setting colors, styles, and screen manipulation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; the code defines constants, functions, and classes for generating escape sequences.",
  "sinks": "Generated escape sequences are intended for terminal output, but there are no direct sinks that handle untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "The functions and class methods produce ANSI escape sequences directly; there are no complex data flows or source-to-sink data paths involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not include hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants, utility functions, and classes to produce ANSI escape codes for terminal styling. It initializes class attributes by wrapping predefined numeric codes into escape sequences. Cursor control functions generate standard ANSI sequences for moving the cursor. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. The code is static and appears to be a standard terminal styling library without any malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for generating ANSI terminal codes. It contains no malicious behavior, no backdoors, and no suspicious activity. The implementation is clear and standard for its purpose.",
