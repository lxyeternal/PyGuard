{
  "purpose": "The module generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor control.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reads are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No output sinks related to untrusted data, no network, file, or environment variable interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The code defines functions and classes that generate escape sequences for terminal control; there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The class attribute initialization wraps standard ANSI codes without obfuscation or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting. It consists of constants, helper functions, and classes that construct escape sequences for colors, styles, and cursor movement. The design is straightforward, without any dynamic code execution, external input handling, or suspicious patterns. No malicious behavior or sabotage evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign library for terminal text styling with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions as expected for its purpose without any security concerns.",
