{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape codes for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor movements.",
  "sources": "Constants defining ANSI codes, functions that generate escape sequences based on input parameters",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output escape sequences; potential for injection if user input is directly used without sanitization",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., title, mode, n, x, y) flow into functions that generate escape sequences, which are then returned as strings",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code. The functions perform straightforward string concatenation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utilities for creating ANSI escape sequences for terminal control. It defines constants for various text colors, styles, and cursor movements, and functions that generate escape sequences based on input parameters. The AnsiCodes classes initialize their attributes as formatted escape sequences, but only using predefined constants and simple string concatenations. There are no dynamic code evaluations, no user input processing that could lead to command injection, and no network operations or system calls. The code appears purely for terminal styling, with no malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal formatting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
