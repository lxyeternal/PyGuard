{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape codes for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor movement.",
  "sources": "Constants and functions defining ANSI codes; class initializations that generate escape sequences based on class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Generated escape sequences used to control terminal output; no data is passed from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Class attribute definitions are converted into escape sequences during object initialization, then used in terminal output functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code relies solely on static ANSI escape sequences and standard Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for text styling and cursor movement. Initialization of AnsiCodes subclasses converts numeric codes into escape sequences. The functions and classes only generate strings for terminal control; they do not execute external commands, handle user input, or process untrusted data. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware patterns are observed. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of terminal styling utilities, with no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for terminal ANSI codes, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides static and dynamic generation of escape sequences for terminal styling.",
