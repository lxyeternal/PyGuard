  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or functionality based on imported modules, but no explicit purpose is clearly outlined within the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, user input via functions, or external modules. Specific input sources are not explicitly shown in the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network operations, file writing, or executing commands with untrusted data. No explicit sink operations are visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, user input) through processing functions to sinks like system commands or network connections, but detailed flow analysis cannot be performed due to incomplete code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code are evident in the provided snippet. Lack of comments or documentation makes understanding intent difficult.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a fragment with minimal context, making detailed analysis challenging. It does not show any signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious in itself. No code injection, insecure practices, or obfuscation detected. Without more code, it's difficult to identify malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no apparent signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, but the lack of context limits confidence. No anomalies or malware indicators are identified.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
