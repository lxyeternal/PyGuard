  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "Based on the comprehensive review, the dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are justified. The low security risk (~0.2) is appropriate given the limited context. Overall, the dependency appears safe, but continued monitoring is recommended if more code or context becomes available."
