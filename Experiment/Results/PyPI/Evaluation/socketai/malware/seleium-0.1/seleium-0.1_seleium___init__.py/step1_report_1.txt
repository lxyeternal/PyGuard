{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform data processing or utility functions, but without specific comments or context, its exact goal is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'input_data' variable or external sources (if present), and possibly from environment variables or files, depending on the implementation details.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, network calls, file writes, or database queries where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or injection vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions or methods to sinks such as output functions, network calls, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies like hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious import statements. However, the absence of comments or context makes full assessment difficult.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis indicates that the code uses standard libraries and functions, with no clear signs of malicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, network connections to suspicious domains, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code structure appears straightforward and lacks obfuscation or unusual patterns. Without specific context or hidden code, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, but limited context reduces confidence. No suspicious patterns or malware-like activities are observed.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
