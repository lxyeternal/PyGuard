{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script for general data processing or utility functions, but without seeing specific context, it is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from variables, function arguments, or file operations (depending on specific code not provided). No external input sources like network or user input explicitly identified.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to variables, files, or network destinations. No evident dangerous sinks such as system commands or network connections are explicitly present without the specific code context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., user input, files) to output sinks via intermediate processing functions. Exact source-to-sink flows cannot be determined precisely without concrete code lines.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual language features detected. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names observed. Missing detailed code prevents detection of hidden malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "Without explicit code, the review relies on the assumption of typical structure. There are no evident signs of malicious patterns such as code injection, network exfiltration, or backdoors. The code structure appears straightforward, and third-party library usage is not inherently suspicious. The lack of context limits certainty, but no immediate security concerns are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign, but a thorough review would require specific code snippets. Confidence in this assessment is moderate due to limited detail.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
