  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The assessments are generally consistent and reasonable. The low malware scores reflect the absence of confirmed malicious code, while the elevated obfuscation suspicion in report 5 justifies a higher obfuscated score. Overall security risk remains low. Minor adjustments could be made to confidence levels in some reports to better match the lack of concrete evidence, but current scores are acceptable."
