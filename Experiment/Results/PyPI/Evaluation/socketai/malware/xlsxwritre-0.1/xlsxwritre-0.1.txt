      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, employing heavy obfuscation and system API interactions to conceal activities such as privilege escalation, system sabotage, or backdoor installation. Despite the benign appearance of the setup() call, the preceding logic indicates malicious intent. The dependency should be flagged as dangerous and avoided in production environments."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The assessments are generally consistent and reasonable. The low malware scores reflect the absence of confirmed malicious code, while the elevated obfuscation suspicion in report 5 justifies a higher obfuscated score. Overall security risk remains low. Minor adjustments could be made to confidence levels in some reports to better match the lack of concrete evidence, but current scores are acceptable."
