{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect Discord tokens from local storage, gather system information, and send this data to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads files from specific browser and Discord data directories, and requests external IP address.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected tokens and system info via HTTP POST request to the webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Tokens are extracted from local files, system info is gathered, and then all data is packaged into a JSON payload and sent over the network to the webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The code specifically searches for and extracts Discord tokens, which indicates malicious intent. It also kills the 'Fiddler.exe' process, possibly to disable debugging or traffic monitoring. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the script stealthily collects and exfiltrates sensitive user data without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to scrape tokens from local storage for Discord and other browsers, indicating potentially malicious activity like token theft. It kills the 'Fiddler' process to avoid network debugging, further suggesting malicious intent. The code gathers system info (IP address, username, hostname), then exfiltrates this data along with any found tokens via a Discord webhook. The script lacks any user interaction, appears to run silently, and focuses on data collection without user knowledge. The use of hardcoded webhook, targeted directories, and token extraction signals malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed for credential theft and unauthorized data exfiltration. It actively searches for sensitive tokens, kills debugging tools, and sends data to an attacker-controlled webhook. Overall, it exhibits high malicious intent.",
