  "purpose": "The script appears to collect Discord tokens from local storage of various applications, gather system information, and send this data to a specified webhook, potentially for malicious purposes such as account theft or surveillance.",
  "sources": [
    "Reading files from directories related to Discord and browsers to find tokens.",
    "Accessing environment variables for user and system info.",
    "Making a network request to obtain public IP address."

  "sinks": [
    "Sending collected tokens and system info to a remote webhook via HTTP POST request."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "The code searches directories for tokens -> tokens are stored in memory -> system info is gathered -> data is packaged into JSON -> POST request sent to webhook with tokens and system info."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Hardcoded webhook URL for exfiltration.",
    "Stealthy token collection from multiple applications without user consent.",
    "Use of threading to kill 'Fiddler.exe' process, possibly to interfere with network analysis.",
    "Lack of error handling around sensitive operations, potentially suppressing errors and making behavior less transparent."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script is designed to locate Discord tokens stored in specific local directories across browsers and Discord clients. It then gathers system info like IP address, hostname, and username. It also kills the 'Fiddler.exe' process, which is often used for debugging network traffic, indicating an attempt to evade network analysis. All gathered data is sent via a POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, a typical exfiltration method. The script runs without user consent, aiming to steal tokens and system info stealthily. No obfuscated code, but it employs techniques to avoid detection, such as threading and suppressing exceptions during network requests. Overall, it exhibits malicious intent with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, intended to exfiltrate Discord tokens and system info to an attacker-controlled webhook, while attempting to evade detection by killing network debugging tools and hiding errors. It should be flagged as malware with high severity.",
