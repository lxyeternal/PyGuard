{
  "purpose": "The code harvests Discord tokens from local directories, collects system information (IP, hostname, username), kills the 'Fiddler.exe' process to evade debugging, and exfiltrates the gathered data via a hardcoded Discord webhook, all operating silently without user notification.",
  "sources": "Local storage files in Discord and browser directories, environment variables for system info, external IP address via HTTP request, and the hardcoded webhook URL.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to the webhook URL containing the tokens and system info, leading to data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The code reads token data from specific directories, extracts tokens using regex, collects system info, then sends this data via a network request to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex patterns to scrape tokens stealthily, kills 'Fiddler.exe' process to evade debugging, employs a hardcoded webhook for exfiltration, operates silently without user notification, and does not obfuscate its code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs credential harvesting by scanning local directories for Discord and browser tokens using regex patterns. It gathers system info such as IP address, hostname, and username. It employs a thread to kill 'Fiddler.exe' to hinder debugging or network analysis. The data collected is formatted into a Discord embed and sent via a POST request to a hardcoded webhook URL, exfiltrating sensitive information stealthily. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and operates silently. These behaviors are characteristic of credential-stealing malware designed for malicious exfiltration and evasion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious malware aimed at credential theft and data exfiltration, employing stealth techniques such as process termination and silent operation. It exfiltrates sensitive tokens and system info to an external server via a hardcoded webhook. The code is not obfuscated and demonstrates clear malicious intent.",
