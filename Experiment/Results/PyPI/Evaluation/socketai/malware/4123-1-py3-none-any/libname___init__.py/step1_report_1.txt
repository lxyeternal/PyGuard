{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract Discord tokens from specific local browser and application directories, gather system information, and send this data to a remote webhook, likely for unauthorized access or data theft.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local storage files within user directories such as Discord, Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, and logs files (.log and .ldb). It also reads environment variables for system info and makes an HTTP GET request to obtain the public IP address.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data via an HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL. It transmits tokens, system info, and IP address as part of a JSON payload, which could leak sensitive user information to an external party.",
  "flows": "Tokens found in local storage are collected and appended into a message string, then included in a JSON payload sent to the webhook. System info such as IP, username, and hostname is collected and sent alongside the tokens.",
  "anomalies": "The code operates silently without user consent, collects sensitive tokens and system data, and sends them to an external URL. It kills a process named 'Fiddler.exe' which is often used for debugging and analysis, indicating an attempt to prevent debugging or analysis. The code uses hardcoded webhook URL and searches for tokens using regex, typical of credential harvesting malware.",
  "analysis": "The script scans common application directories for Discord and browser token storage, extracting potential user tokens via regex patterns. It collects system information like IP, username, hostname, and then sends all this information via a webhook. It also attempts to kill 'Fiddler.exe' process to avoid debugging. The code does not perform any malicious actions beyond data collection and exfiltration. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution is evident. All operations align with typical credential-stealing malware functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, functioning as a credential stealer and information logger, exfiltrating sensitive user data to an external webhook. It employs techniques to avoid debugging and stealthily harvest tokens and system info. This script should be classified as malicious malware with high risk, and its use is strongly discouraged.",
