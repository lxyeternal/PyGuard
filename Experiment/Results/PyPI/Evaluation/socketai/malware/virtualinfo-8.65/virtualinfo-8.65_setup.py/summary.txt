  "conclusion": "The script exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the silent, obfuscated PowerShell command execution. The behavior aligns with common malware tactics such as stealth payload delivery and backdoor installation. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified, indicating a high security risk. Until the command is decoded and analyzed, the package should be treated as potentially malicious."
