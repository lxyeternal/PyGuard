  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, which is a red flag for malicious activity. The high obfuscation and silent execution justify elevated malware and risk scores. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is essential to confirm malicious intent. Until then, the package should be treated as potentially malicious, and caution is advised."
