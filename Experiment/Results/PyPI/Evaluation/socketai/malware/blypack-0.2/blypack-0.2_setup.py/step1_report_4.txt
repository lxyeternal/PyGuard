{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'blypack', with a post-installation function that executes a system command to download a file from a suspicious URL.",
  "sources": "The 'post_install' function calls os.system with a wget command targeting a suspicious URL.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes an external command with untrusted data (the URL), which could lead to malicious code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The script runs 'post_install' immediately after defining it, which calls os.system to download a file from a potentially malicious URL.",
  "anomalies": "The 'post_install' function downloads content from a suspicious external URL during setup, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior. The URL is obfuscated or non-standard. The script calls 'post_install' unconditionally at the end of the script, executing external commands during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' and 'setuptools' but does not perform any other significant operations. The 'post_install' function executes a system command using os.system to download data from a suspicious URL, which indicates malicious intent or sabotage. The setup configuration is standard but includes a malicious side effect of retrieving external content during installation. The call to 'post_install()' at the end ensures the command executes immediately upon running the script, posing a security risk. The URL used appears suspicious and could be a command-and-control or malicious payload delivery point.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior: it automatically downloads content from a suspicious URL during installation, likely for malicious purposes such as remote control, data exfiltration, or further payload delivery. The immediate execution of 'post_install' during setup is a clear indicator of malicious intent.",
