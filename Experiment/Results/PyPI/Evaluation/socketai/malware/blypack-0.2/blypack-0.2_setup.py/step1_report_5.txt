{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'blypack' that executes a command after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it uses a hardcoded URL within os.system call in the post_install() function.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a wget command to download content from an external URL, potentially leading to data exfiltration or executing malicious content.",
  "flows": "The script calls post_install() immediately after defining it, which runs 'wget' to download a file from a suspicious URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses os.system to download content from an external URL during installation, which is unusual for typical setup scripts. The URL appears suspicious and potentially malicious. No dependencies or other legitimate setup steps are present.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a function post_install() that calls os.system with a wget command pointing to a suspicious URL. This function is called immediately after its definition, during the script execution. There are no user inputs or external data sources; all actions are hardcoded. The use of os.system for network activity during package installation is a security risk, as it can download and execute malicious content without user consent. The URL is suspicious and indicates possible malicious intent, such as executing remote code or exfiltrating data. No other dependencies or features mitigate this risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior by downloading content from an external URL during package installation. The use of os.system with a suspicious URL suggests an attempt to execute or download malicious code. The package should be considered unsafe due to this behavior.",
