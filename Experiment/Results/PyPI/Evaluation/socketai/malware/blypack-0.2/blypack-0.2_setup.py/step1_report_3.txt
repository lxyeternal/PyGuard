{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package named 'blypack' and includes a function intended to run after installation, which downloads content from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input explicitly, but the 'os.system' command executes a remote URL download.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' call executes a wget command that downloads data from an external server, which could lead to executing malicious content if the URL is malicious.",
  "flows": "The setup script calls 'post_install()' directly after defining it, which executes 'os.system' with the remote URL, potentially downloading and executing malicious content during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The immediate invocation of 'post_install()' in the setup script is unusual and potentially malicious, as it runs untrusted code during package installation. The URL used in wget is suspicious and not a legitimate domain, indicating possible malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a package but includes a function 'post_install()' that runs a system command to download a file from a remote URL. This function is invoked directly after the setup configuration, causing the download to occur immediately upon script execution. The remote URL appears suspicious and may host malicious content. There are no safeguards, checks, or validation steps before executing the system command. The immediate execution of remote content during package installation is highly suspicious and a common technique for delivering malware or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by downloading content from a remote URL during installation, which could lead to executing malicious code on the user's system. The practice of executing 'post_install()' immediately is unusual and indicative of malicious intent.",
