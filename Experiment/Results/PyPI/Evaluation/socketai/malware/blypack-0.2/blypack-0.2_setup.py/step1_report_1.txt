{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'blypack', which installs dependencies and runs a post-installation function.",
  "sources": "The function 'post_install()' executes a system command to download a file from a suspicious URL.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' call runs an external command with a potentially malicious URL, which could lead to remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The code executes 'post_install()' after setup, which in turn calls 'os.system' to download a file from an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The 'post_install()' function unconditionally calls 'os.system' with a URL that appears suspicious and unrelated to typical setup procedures; no validation or safeguards are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'os' and 'setuptools', defines a 'post_install' function that runs a system command to download a file from an external URL, and then calls 'post_install' immediately after defining it. This behavior during package installation is unusual and suspicious because it contacts an external, potentially malicious server. The URL 'https://kymslgsrz9xelqdvm7uxogrrnit9ha5z.oastify.com/test' is not related to the package's setup process, indicating a possible malicious intent to fetch or execute malicious code or exfiltrate data. No safeguards, validation, or environment checks are present, which further suggests malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by executing a remote download during setup, which can lead to security compromise. The immediate invocation of 'post_install' to run an external URL is suspicious and indicates potential malware or supply chain attack.",
