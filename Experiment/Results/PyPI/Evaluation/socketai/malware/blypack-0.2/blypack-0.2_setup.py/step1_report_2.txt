{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'blypack' and executes a post-installation function.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package name, version, and dependencies from the setup configuration. The post_install() function executes a system command.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call in post_install() runs a command that downloads a file from an external URL, which could potentially be malicious.",
  "flows": "The script executes post_install() immediately after defining it, which triggers the os.system() command to download data from an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The post_install() function is called directly in the script, which is unusual for setup scripts, and it executes an external wget command during the script's runtime.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package using setuptools, which is standard. However, immediately after defining the setup configuration, it calls post_install(), which runs an os.system() command to fetch data from an external URL. This behavior is suspicious because it executes code outside of typical package installation processes, potentially downloading malicious payloads. The URL used is obscure and not associated with common repositories, increasing suspicion. No other security issues like hardcoded credentials or obfuscation are present. The immediate execution of a wget command during setup indicates malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading external data during package installation, which could be used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or payload delivery. The immediate invocation of post_install() and the external URL strongly suggest malicious intent.",
