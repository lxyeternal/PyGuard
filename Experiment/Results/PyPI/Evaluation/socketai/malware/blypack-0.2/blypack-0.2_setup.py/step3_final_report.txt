{
  "purpose": "The code executes a remote download during package setup by calling post_install(), which runs os.system() to fetch a suspicious URL.",
  "sources": "The call to post_install() immediately after its definition, triggering os.system() with a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() command executing 'wget' to download from an external, suspicious URL.",
  "flows": "The script runs setup(), then directly calls post_install(), which executes os.system() to download external content.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate execution of remote download during setup without validation; use of os.system() with a suspicious URL; no safeguards or validation checks.",
  "analysis": "The code unconditionally runs post_install() during setup, executing a wget command to download from a suspicious URL. This behavior indicates malicious intent, typical of supply chain attacks or malware delivery. The URL is unrelated to package functionality, and executing external commands during setup without validation is dangerous. The high malware and security risk scores assigned by the reports are justified by this behavior. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the malicious activity is clear and observable.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by executing a remote download during package installation, representing a supply chain security threat. The high malware and security risk scores are appropriate and justified. The package should be flagged as malicious and removed from distribution until the behavior is addressed.",
