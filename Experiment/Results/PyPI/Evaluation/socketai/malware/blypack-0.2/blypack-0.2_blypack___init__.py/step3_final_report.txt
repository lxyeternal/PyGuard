  "purpose": "This `__init__.py` file serves solely as a package marker, indicating the directory is a Python package.",
  "sources": "There are no data sources, input reads, or external data interactions in the file.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution paths exist, as the file contains only a comment and no code.",
  "anomalies": "The file is completely empty aside from a comment, with no suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The file is an empty `__init__.py`, which is standard for Python packages. No code, data handling, or external communication is present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The absence of code means no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or re-scoring is necessary.",
