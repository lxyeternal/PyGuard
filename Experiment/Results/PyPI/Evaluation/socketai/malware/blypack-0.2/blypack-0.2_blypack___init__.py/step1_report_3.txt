  "purpose": "Initializes the Python package 'mi_paquete'.",
  "sources": "No input sources are present; the file only contains package initialization code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the file contains only a package initialization statement.",
  "anomalies": "The file contains no code or suspicious constructs; only an import statement for package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The __init__.py file is typically used to initialize a package and does not usually contain executable code unless explicitly added. This file appears to be empty, serving only as a package marker. No code execution, input reading, or data handling occurs. Therefore, there are no security risks or malicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "This is an empty or minimal __init__.py file with no malicious content or security concerns. It simply marks the directory as a Python package.",
