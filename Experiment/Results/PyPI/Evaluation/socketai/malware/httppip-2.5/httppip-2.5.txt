      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion for malicious activity due to the use of obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell commands during package setup. The behavior aligns with tactics used in malware delivery, warranting treating this package as highly suspicious or malicious until further decoding of the payload confirms benign intent."
