  "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant indicators of malicious behavior, primarily due to the obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell payload during setup. While the package setup appears legitimate, the embedded payload and execution pattern warrant high caution. Further decoding and analysis of the payload are recommended to confirm malicious activity. Overall, the code should be treated as potentially malicious with high suspicion."
