{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious data theft and reconnaissance tool designed to extract and exfiltrate sensitive information such as browser credentials, cookies, system info, tokens, and files from the victim's machine, then send the collected data to an external server via webhooks or file uploads.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (e.g., 'COMPUTERNAME', 'LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA', 'TEMP'), file system paths (browser profiles, local state files, SQLite databases), clipboard contents, subprocess outputs, and network responses.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data sinks include network requests (httpx, requests, urlopen) that send data to external URLs, file writes (e.g., passwords, cookies, history, credit cards), and ZIP archive creation for exfiltration. Also, clipboard manipulation and process termination are potential malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as browser profile files, environment variables, clipboard, and network requests to sinks including network exfiltration (Webhook POSTs, file uploads) and local storage (text files, ZIP archives). The code also terminates processes (like Chrome) before collecting data to ensure access, then zips and sends data.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious behaviors include hardcoded webhook URL, automatic installation and persistence mechanisms, killing common security and debugging processes, extracting tokens from browser files and Firefox profiles, decrypting encrypted credentials, and relabeling files for exfiltration. The code also contains obfuscated and misleading comments and variable names. Notably, it attempts to evade detection via VM and process checks, and incorporates self-deletion routines.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive information stealer targeting Windows systems. It gathers system info, extracts browser passwords, cookies, history, credit card info, and tokens from Discord and browsers. It automates clipboard monitoring to swap crypto addresses with specified addresses, likely to redirect funds. It kills security processes, modifies Discord and browser files, archives collected data, and uploads or sends it via webhooks. The use of functions like 'DecryptValue', decryption of encrypted credentials, and process management indicates intent to bypass security measures. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL, process termination routines, and data exfiltration points confirm malicious intent. The code also includes functions to upload files anonymously, check for VM indicators, and evade detection, all typical of malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to harvest sensitive user data, browser credentials, tokens, and files, then exfiltrate this data to external servers. It employs multiple anti-analysis techniques such as process killing, VM detection, file encryption, and persistence mechanisms. The presence of hardcoded URLs, data theft routines, and process termination indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent and security risk. The overall security risk score is high, and malware probability is confirmed.",
