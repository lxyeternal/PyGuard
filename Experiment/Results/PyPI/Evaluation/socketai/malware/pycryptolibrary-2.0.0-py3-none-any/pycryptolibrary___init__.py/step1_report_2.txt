{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious payload intended to steal sensitive user data including passwords, cookies, tokens, system information, and browser data, then exfiltrate it via webhooks or uploads to external servers.",
  "sources": "User environment variables, clipboard, browser data files (Login Data, Cookies, History, Web Data), local files, process listings, network requests, and system commands.",
  "sinks": "Network POST requests to external URLs, Discord webhook POSTs, file uploads to transfer.sh and anonfiles, command execution via subprocess, and file system modifications (zipping and deleting files).",
  "flows": "Sources such as clipboard, browser databases, environment variables, and system info are read, decrypted if needed, and then sent through network requests or uploaded files. Data is collected, formatted, and transmitted via webhook or external hosting, often after being processed or encrypted locally.",
  "anomalies": "Code installs numerous suspicious packages without user consent, posts user data (such as system info and user tokens) to external servers, kills known security or analysis processes, manipulates browser data files, and automates data exfiltration including passwords, cookies, tokens, and system details. Also contains obfuscated and misleading function names, as well as several hardcoded external URLs and identifiers.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by installing and importing numerous modules, including requests, httpx, pyperclip, and cryptography, which are used for data collection and network communication. It then gathers system info, browser data, and user tokens from various browsers and applications, decrypts encrypted data, and uploads or sends this information via webhooks and file hosting services. It contains functionalities to steal cookies, passwords, browsing history, credit card info, and Roblox tokens. The code also attempts process killing for security tools and injects itself into startup paths to persist. It heavily relies on external URLs, some of which appear suspicious, and uses obfuscated patterns to hide malicious intent. The overall design clearly indicates a malicious data exfiltration and surveillance purpose, with multiple redundant methods to ensure data theft and obfuscation of activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious malware designed for comprehensive user data theft, system reconnaissance, and evasion. It exfiltrates sensitive information including credentials, tokens, cookies, system details, and browser data to external servers via webhooks and file uploads. It also attempts persistence and process termination of security tools, making it highly dangerous. The overall security risk score is very high due to its extensive malicious features and data collection methods.",
