{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to steal sensitive user information, including browser data, tokens, credentials, cookies, and system info, and exfiltrate it via webhooks or file uploads. It also appears to manipulate system processes and files for persistence or sabotage.",
  "sources": "System environment variables, clipboard data, local files (browser profiles, cookies, passwords, history, credit cards), process lists, network requests, and user input.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external URLs (discord webhooks, transfer.sh, file uploads), writing to files, clipboard modification, process termination, system commands (taskkill, registry access), ZIP file creation and deletion.",
  "flows": "Sources such as clipboard, files, and process info flow into decryption, collection, and exfiltration functions; collected data is sent over HTTP requests or uploaded as files; system commands and process kills are triggered based on checks; browser data and tokens flow from local storage to network exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation in code, extensive use of environment variables and system commands for persistence and sabotage, inclusion of numerous suspicious process names, hardcoded webhook URL, malicious intent evident in stealing credentials and cookies, frequent process termination, and file manipulation. Also, the code has redundant and complex logic designed to evade detection.",
  "analysis": "The script operates as a credential and data stealer, targeting browsers and system info, using decryption techniques for stored passwords and cookies. It collects tokens from various applications like Discord, Chrome, Firefox, and Roblox, and exfiltrates via webhooks or file uploads. It includes functionality to kill security or analysis tools, disable certain protections, and persist via startup modifications. The code employs obfuscation and anti-debugging measures, with extensive system info gathering and network activity, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code exhibits clear malicious behavior focused on data theft, system sabotage, and stealth operations. It collects sensitive user data from browsers and system, then exfiltrates it covertly, while attempting to disable security measures and persist across reboots. Its structure and content strongly suggest malicious intent and sabotage activities.",
