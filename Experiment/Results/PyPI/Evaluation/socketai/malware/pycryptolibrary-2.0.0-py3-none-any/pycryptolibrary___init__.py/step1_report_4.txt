{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malware payload designed to exfiltrate user data, including browser credentials, cookies, system info, tokens, and wallet addresses, and then send this data to a remote server or Discord webhook. It also manipulates browser data, monitors processes, and performs file uploads, indicating malicious intent to steal and transmit sensitive information.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (e.g., 'COMPUTERNAME', 'LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA', 'TEMP'), clipboard (pyperclip.paste()), local files (browsers' local state, cookies, passwords, history, credit card info), process information (psutil), system commands (via subprocess), and web requests (httpx, requests).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests to external URLs ('https://kekwltd.ru/relay', transfer.sh, Discord webhook), file writes (credentials, cookies, history, credit card info), clipboard modifications (cryptocurrency addresses), process termination commands, and zipped exfiltration of data files for uploading. Also, data is sent via POST requests to remote servers and embedded in Discord messages.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (system info, browser data, clipboard, tokens) through decryption and parsing functions, then exfiltrates via network POST requests, file uploads, or Discord webhook messages. For example, browser passwords and cookies are extracted, decrypted, stored locally, then uploaded or sent over network requests; tokens are validated and associated with user IDs before transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL ('https://kekwltd.ru/relay'), presence of numerous suspicious process names for termination, extensive use of encryption and decryption functions, multiple self-executing threads, obfuscated or misleading function names, and significant code complexity aimed at stealth. Also, the code attempts to disable certain security measures and collects tokens from multiple sources, including private browser data and system information. Additionally, it manipulates browser data files and packs exfiltrated data into ZIP archives for upload.",
  "analysis": "The code is highly suspicious, containing multiple malicious behaviors: it installs numerous packages, exfiltrates system and user data, decrypts stored credentials, extracts tokens from browsers and Firefox profiles, manipulates clipboard for crypto addresses, kills security and process-monitoring tools, disables certain protections, and uploads data via multiple methods. The presence of hardcoded URLs and extensive obfuscation-like patterns (e.g., functions like 'CryptUnprotectData', encrypted key extraction, and layered data handling) strongly suggests malicious intent. The code appears designed to stealthily steal sensitive user data, including passwords, cookies, tokens, and system info, then upload or send it to an attacker-controlled server or Discord webhook. It also includes code for zip packaging and file uploads to transfer.sh, further indicating malicious data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is malicious, serving as a comprehensive info-stealer malware targeting browser credentials, tokens, cookies, system info, and wallet addresses. It employs encryption, system manipulation, and network communication to covertly exfiltrate sensitive user data. Its structure and functions strongly indicate intent for privacy invasion, data theft, and unauthorized data transmission, thus posing a high security risk.",
