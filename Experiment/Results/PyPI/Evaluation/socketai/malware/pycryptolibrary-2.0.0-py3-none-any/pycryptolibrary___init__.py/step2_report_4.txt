  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n**Summary:**  \nDescribes a highly malicious script that steals browser data, tokens, credentials, cookies, system info, manipulates processes, disables protections, and exfiltrates data via webhooks/files. It notes obfuscation, suspicious process names, hardcoded URLs, and sabotage features.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code clearly performs data theft, exfiltration, process killing, persistence, and system info gathering.  \n- The webhook URL is hardcoded (`https://kekwltd.ru/relay`) and used for exfiltration.  \n- Obfuscation and redundant logic are present.  \n- The description matches the code's behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: **1.0** (correct, malicious activity is evident)  \n- Obfuscated: **0.8** (heavy obfuscation, complex logic)  \n- Risk: **1.0** (high, due to extensive malicious features)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.  \n**Confidence:** 0.95 (appropriate given the detailed analysis)\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n**Summary:**  \nDescribes a comprehensive info-stealer that collects passwords, cookies, tokens, system info, and exfiltrates via webhooks, uploads, and kills security processes. Emphasizes decryption, token extraction, and stealth.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code contains functions for stealing passwords, cookies, tokens from browsers, Roblox, etc.  \n- Uses requests to send data to `https://kekwltd.ru/relay`.  \n- Implements process termination routines, persistence, and data collection.  \n- The analysis matches the code's behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: **1.0** (malicious data theft confirmed)  \n- Obfuscated: **0.2** (some obfuscation, but code is relatively clear)  \n- Risk: **1.0** (very high, given the scope of data theft and sabotage)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.  \n**Confidence:** 0.95\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n**Summary:**  \nFocuses on data exfiltration, system info, process killing, and stealth. Highlights decryption, token extraction, and system manipulation.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code performs system info collection, token extraction, password and cookie theft, process killing, and exfiltration via webhooks/files.  \n- The analysis aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: **1.0** (clear malicious activity)  \n- Obfuscated: **0.2** (some obfuscation, but understandable)  \n- Risk: **1.0** (very high)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.  \n**Confidence:** 0.95\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n**Summary:**  \nDescribes a malware that exfiltrates credentials, cookies, tokens, system info, wallet addresses, and performs process termination and stealth.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code collects passwords, cookies, tokens, system info, wallet addresses, screenshots, and uploads via webhooks and file hosting.  \n- Contains functions for decrypting stored data, killing processes, disabling protections, and persistence.  \n- Behaviors match the description.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: **1.0** (definite malicious activity)  \n- Obfuscated: **0.2** (not heavily obfuscated)  \n- Risk: **1.0** (severe security threat)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.  \n**Confidence:** 0.95\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n**Summary:**  \nA comprehensive info-stealer targeting system info, credentials, tokens, files, with process killing, anti-analysis, and exfiltration routines.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code gathers system info, browser passwords, cookies, tokens, and uploads data via webhooks/files.  \n- Contains routines for process termination, persistence, and anti-analysis checks.  \n- The analysis matches the code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: **1.0** (malicious, extensive data theft)  \n- Obfuscated: **0.2** (not heavily obfuscated)  \n- Risk: **1.0** (high risk)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.  \n**Confidence:** 0.95\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Justification & Personal Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as malicious with full certainty. I agree with **1.0** for all.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is somewhat obfuscated, but not heavily; many functions are clear, with some obfuscation techniques. I would rate **0.2** to **0.3**. Given the reports' scores, I lean toward **0.2** as well.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign **1.0**, which is justified given the extensive malicious behavior, data theft, sabotage, and persistence mechanisms.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** **1.0** (confirmed malicious)  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0.2** (light obfuscation)  \n- **Risk:** **1.0** (severe threat)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- All reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.  \n- The detailed behaviors—data theft, exfiltration, process killing, persistence, and system info gathering—justify the high risk and malware scores.  \n- Obfuscation is present but not extreme, so the assigned 0.2-0.8 range is appropriate, leaning toward the lower end.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and risk scores at 1.0.  \n- Set obfuscated score around 0.2 for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**End of review.**",
