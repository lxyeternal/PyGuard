  "conclusion": "The setup script itself is harmless; however, the package name 'PaypalOtpBypass' suggests malicious intent to bypass PayPal's security measures. No malicious code or obfuscation is present, but the naming indicates potential misuse. The scores should reflect low malware risk but moderate security concern due to intent implied by the name."
