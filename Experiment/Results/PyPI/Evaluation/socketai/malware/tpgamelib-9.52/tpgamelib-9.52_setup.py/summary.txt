  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell execution conditioned on filesystem state, indicative of malicious activity or a backdoor. The high obfuscation and stealthy execution increase the security risk significantly. The package setup appears legitimate but is compromised by embedded malicious code. It should be flagged for further analysis, decoding the payload, and possibly removed or sandboxed."
