  "conclusion": "This code functions as a credential stealer and data exfiltration tool targeting Discord users. It harvests tokens, validates them, collects personal information, and exfiltrates the data to an obfuscated webhook URL. The behavior is malicious, privacy-invasive, and poses a high security threat."
