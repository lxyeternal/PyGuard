  "purpose": "Retrieve and display the IP address information for a hardcoded IP address (8.8.8.8) using an external API.",
  "sources": "requests.get() call to fetch data from https://ipapi.co/8.8.8.8/json/",
  "sinks": "Printing the retrieved IP address from the JSON response.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves data from the external API -> JSON response parsed -> IP address printed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets other than a fixed IP address; no obfuscated code or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the requests library, defines a function that makes an HTTP GET request to a public API with a hardcoded IP address, parses the JSON response, and prints the 'ip' field. There is no user input, no data exfiltration, nor any malicious code or behavior. The request is straightforward and uses a common library. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply fetches and displays the IP address for a specific, hardcoded IP using a public API. It does not exhibit malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
