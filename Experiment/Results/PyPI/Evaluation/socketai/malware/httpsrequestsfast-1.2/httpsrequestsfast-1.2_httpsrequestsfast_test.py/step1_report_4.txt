  "purpose": "Retrieve and print the IP address information for the IP 8.8.8.8 using the ipapi.co API.",
  "sources": "requests.get call to 'https://ipapi.co/8.8.8.8/json/' and JSON parsing of the response.",
  "sinks": "Printing the IP address obtained from the API response.",
  "flows": "Code executes requests.get to fetch data, then accesses 'ip' key in the JSON response, and prints it.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious URL beyond legitimate IP geolocation API, no unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple API call to ipapi.co to retrieve geolocation data for a fixed IP address (8.8.8.8). It then prints the 'ip' field from the response. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data leaks, and no malicious or suspicious code behaviors. The use of a publicly available API for a common purpose does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performs a benign API request, and prints the result without any malicious or suspicious activity. It appears to be a simple IP lookup utility with no security risks.",
