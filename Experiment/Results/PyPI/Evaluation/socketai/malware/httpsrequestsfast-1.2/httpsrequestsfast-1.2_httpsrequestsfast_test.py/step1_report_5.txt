  "purpose": "Fetches geolocation data for IP address 8.8.8.8 from an external API and prints the IP address.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://ipapi.co/8.8.8.8/json/' in the requests.get() call, which retrieves data from an external API.",
  "sinks": "The print() function outputs the IP address to the console; the JSON response is processed but no external data is sent or stored beyond this.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves data from the external API, which is parsed as JSON, then the IP address is printed. No further data flow or storage occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code present. Usage of a public API to fetch IP data is common and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code makes a straightforward HTTP GET request to a known geolocation API service with a fixed IP address. It parses the returned JSON and prints the IP. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious code. The code operates within normal bounds of a typical API call and data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply retrieves and displays information about a specific IP address from an external API without any suspicious behavior.",
