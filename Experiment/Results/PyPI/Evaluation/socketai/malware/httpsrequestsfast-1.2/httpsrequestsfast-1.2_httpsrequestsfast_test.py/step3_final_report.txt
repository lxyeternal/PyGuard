  "purpose": "Retrieve and print the IP address associated with a fixed IP (8.8.8.8) using an external API.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to https://ipapi.co/8.8.8.8/json/ and JSON parsing of the response.",
  "sinks": "Printing the 'ip' field to standard output.",
  "flows": "requests.get() fetches data -> JSON response parsed -> print(x['ip']) outputs the IP.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward API call with no suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple, benign external API request to retrieve geolocation data for a fixed IP and prints the IP address. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors. The external API is legitimate, and the code's purpose is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate given the straightforward nature of the script. External requests pose minimal risk in this context, and no vulnerabilities or malicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign IP lookup utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
