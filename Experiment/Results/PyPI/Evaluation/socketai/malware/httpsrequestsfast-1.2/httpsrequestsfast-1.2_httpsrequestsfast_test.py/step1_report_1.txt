  "purpose": "Retrieve and print the public IP address of a specified IP (8.8.8.8) using an external API.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from an external URL via requests.get().json()",
  "sinks": "Printing the IP address using print() does not pose a security risk, but the request to external API could leak data if misused.",
  "flows": "requests.get() fetches data from the API; the response is parsed as JSON; the IP address is extracted and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code features detected; standard API request and JSON handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple API request to ipapi.co for the IP 8.8.8.8, then prints the 'ip' field from the response. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. It does not send or store sensitive data beyond a single API call and output. There are no evident backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious intent. It appears to be a benign network utility script.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward script to fetch and display a specified IP address via a public API. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The external request is standard and does not appear suspicious.",
