{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Receiver class that retrieves the public IP address of the system when an instance is created.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from an external URL ('https://api.ipify.org/') via requests.get method in the _get_ip function.",
  "sinks": "The data fetched from the external URL is returned as plain text; potential sink if used maliciously to exfiltrate data.",
  "flows": "The _get_ip method fetches data from the URL and returns the IP address, which could be used elsewhere in the application.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The class is straightforward: it provides a method to retrieve the public IP address using an external API. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious network communication beyond standard API use. The only external call is to a reputable service (api.ipify.org) for IP retrieval. No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as a simple IP retrieval utility. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
