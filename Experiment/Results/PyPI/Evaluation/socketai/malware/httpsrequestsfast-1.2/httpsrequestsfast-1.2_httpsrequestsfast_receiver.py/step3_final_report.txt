  "purpose": "Retrieve the system's public IP address via an external API call.",
  "sources": "requests.get('https://api.ipify.org/')",
  "sinks": "Return of the response text, which contains the IP address",
  "flows": "External API request (source) to return statement (sink)",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward API call with no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Receiver' with a method '_get_ip' that performs an HTTP GET request to a reputable IP service and returns the response text. The implementation is simple, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The request is standard for IP retrieval, and the code does not perform any data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of suspicious patterns, and the use of a trusted API further reduces risk. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the security risk is minimal, around 0.1, reflecting the external network call but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for fetching the public IP address. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
