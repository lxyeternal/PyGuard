  "purpose": "Minimal import statement from a suspicious package, no further code or actions.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading the 'httpsrequestsfast' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "None; only an import with no subsequent function calls or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual module name 'httpsrequestsfast', presence of a semicolon in Python code, minimal code structure, no additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement with an unconventional semicolon. The module name resembles common HTTP request libraries but is not standard, raising suspicion. No functions are invoked, and no network activity or data flows are evident. The minimal code and lack of malicious behavior suggest low malware likelihood. The suspicious name warrants further verification of the package source, but based on this snippet alone, no malicious intent is demonstrated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign but the package name 'httpsrequestsfast' should be verified for legitimacy. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The risk score is moderate due to the suspicious name but justified as low given the lack of further activity.",
