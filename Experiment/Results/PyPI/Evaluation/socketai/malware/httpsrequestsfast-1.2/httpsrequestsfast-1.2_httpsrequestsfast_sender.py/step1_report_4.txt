  "purpose": "The class 'Sender' provides methods to encode and decode data using base64 encoding, likely intended for data transmission or storage.",
  "sources": "Input data to the methods _encode_data and _decode_data",
  "sinks": "Encoded data returned by _encode_data, decoded data returned by _decode_data",
  "flows": "Input string -> encode to bytes -> base64 encode -> return encoded string; base64 string -> encode to bytes -> base64 decode -> return original string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The class performs straightforward base64 encoding/decoding without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with two private methods for base64 encoding and decoding of strings. The methods follow standard procedures without any obfuscated or suspicious features. There are no external data sources, network operations, or malicious intent evident. The code is basic utility functions and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs simple, harmless data encoding and decoding with no signs of malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign utility class intended for encoding data, with no security risks or malware indications.",
