{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for encoding and decoding data using Base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to _encode_data() and _decode_data() methods.",
  "sinks": "Base64 encoded or decoded data returned by methods; no external sinks or output actions present.",
  "flows": "Data from input strings flows into encoding or decoding functions, resulting in Base64 strings or decoded ASCII data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The use of base64 encoding is common and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The class 'Sender' has methods for encoding and decoding data using base64. Both methods are straightforward, with no external network activity, no suspicious data handling, or unusual code constructs. The encoding/decoding processes are standard and do not pose an inherent security risk or malicious intent. No source-to-sink malicious flow is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple utility for base64 encoding and decoding with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, data leaks, or other malicious code. Overall, it seems benign.",
