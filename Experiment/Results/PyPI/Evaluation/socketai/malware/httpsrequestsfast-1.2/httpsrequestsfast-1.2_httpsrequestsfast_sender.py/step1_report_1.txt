{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods for encoding and decoding data using Base64 encoding, likely for data transformation or transmission purposes.",
  "sources": "The methods read input data via function parameters (_encode_data and _decode_data).",
  "sinks": "The data is processed internally, with no external sinks evident in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input data is encoded or decoded directly through the methods, with no further data flow outside the functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Sender class with methods to encode and decode strings using base64. The methods perform standard encoding/decoding without any side effects or external network activity. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The structure is simple and secure for its purpose, with no suspicious or unusual features.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for Base64 encoding and decoding. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment. No indicators of malware or malicious intent are present.",
