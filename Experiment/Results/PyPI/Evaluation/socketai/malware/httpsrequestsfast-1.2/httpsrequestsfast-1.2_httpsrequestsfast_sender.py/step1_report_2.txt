{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for encoding and decoding data using Base64.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via method parameters in _encode_data and _decode_data functions.",
  "sinks": "The base64 encoding/decoding processes could potentially be used to obscure data, but are not inherently dangerous; no external sinks such as network transmission or file writing are present.",
  "flows": "Input data passed to _encode_data is encoded to base64; input data to _decode_data is decoded from base64 back to ASCII.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses private methods (_encode_data and _decode_data) for data transformation, but these are straightforward and do not contain suspicious or malicious code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with methods to encode and decode strings using base64. No external data sources or sinks are present, and the methods are standard utility functions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and appears safe. The class could be used maliciously if integrated into larger malicious code, but in isolation, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple utility for base64 encoding and decoding, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code, and performs basic data transformations safely.",
