  "purpose": "The code provides a class for encoding and decoding data using base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "The methods '_encode_data' and '_decode_data' which read input data as strings.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output encoded or decoded strings; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data is taken from method parameters, encoded or decoded, and returned; no external data flow or network transfer observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The encoding/decoding functions are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods for base64 encoding and decoding strings. It does not include external data transfer, network communication, or suspicious behavior. The use of base64 is common for encoding data, and there are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be utility functions for simple encoding tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic data encoding and decoding with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears benign and intended for standard data processing.",
