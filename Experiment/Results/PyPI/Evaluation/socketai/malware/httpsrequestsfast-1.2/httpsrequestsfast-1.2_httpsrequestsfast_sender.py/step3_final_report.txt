  "purpose": "Utility for encoding and decoding data using base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to _encode_data and _decode_data methods.",
  "sinks": "Decoded data returned from _decode_data; no external sinks or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into _encode_data or _decode_data methods, processed via base64 functions, and outputs the transformed data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Sender class with two methods: _encode_data encodes a string into base64, and _decode_data decodes a base64 string back to ASCII. Both use standard Python base64 library functions without side effects, network activity, or hidden behaviors. The methods are simple, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence levels are high, and no logical flaws are evident. The code's functionality is a common utility, and there are no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for base64 encoding and decoding with no malicious or security concerns. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
