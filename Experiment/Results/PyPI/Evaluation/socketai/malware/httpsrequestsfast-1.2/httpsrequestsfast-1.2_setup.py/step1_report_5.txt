  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for the Python package 'httpsrequestsfast' for distribution.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters in the setup() function, such as name, version, author details, URLs, and install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or external execution; no code execution or data processing beyond package metadata definition.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code solely specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward package setup with no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from distutils.core and calls setup() with package metadata, including name, version, author, URLs, and dependencies. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated elements, or unusual patterns. The package dependencies are standard, and URLs point to GitHub resources without any embedded malicious payloads or commands. The code adheres to typical package configuration practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
