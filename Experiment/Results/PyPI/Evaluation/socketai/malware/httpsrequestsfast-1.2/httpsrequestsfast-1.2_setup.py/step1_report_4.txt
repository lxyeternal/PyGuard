  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for the Python package 'httpsrequestsfast' for distribution.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters such as name, packages, version, license, description, author, author_email, url, download_url, and install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "N/A; setup configuration does not include data flows or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. All fields are typical for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports distutils.core.setup and calls setup() with standard package metadata and dependencies. No user input, environment variables, or runtime data processing occurs. All parameters are static strings or lists, with no embedded code execution or dynamic behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a benign, standard Python package setup script.",
