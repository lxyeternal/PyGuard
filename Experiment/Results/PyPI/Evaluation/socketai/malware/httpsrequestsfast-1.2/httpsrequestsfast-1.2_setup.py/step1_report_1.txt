{
  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'httpsrequestsfast' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of package metadata (name, version, author, URL, etc.), 'install_requires' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data processing or external output beyond package metadata.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is a static setup script without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The download URL points to a GitHub archive, but this is typical for package sources.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'distutils.core' to define package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity occurs within this code. The package name, author info, and URLs are static and appear legitimate. The download URL points to a GitHub archive which is standard for source distribution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and intended solely for packaging distribution. No malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.",
