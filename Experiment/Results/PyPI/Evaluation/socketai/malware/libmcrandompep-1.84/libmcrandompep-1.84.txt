      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior: it executes an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup, conditioned on filesystem state, with a suspicious URL present. The obfuscation and silent execution are typical in supply chain attacks or backdoors. While the exact payload remains unknown without decoding, the indicators justify a high suspicion of malicious intent and security risk. It should be treated as potentially malicious until further analysis confirms benign behavior."
