{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be setting up a Python package named 'libmcrandompep', but also includes hidden and suspicious behavior that may be used to execute malicious commands or backdoors.",
  "sources": "The code reads system state and files ('os.path.exists'), and executes a subprocess with a base64-encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes potentially malicious PowerShell code, which can be used for command and control, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the existence of 'tahg', then conditionally executes a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess, which likely fetches or executes remote code. The setup function is called afterwards but is unrelated to the malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated base64 PowerShell command, hidden subprocess execution, and lack of any legitimate reason for executing this command in a setup script. The URL 'esquelesquad.rip' and the base64 string suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'distutils.core' to define a package setup, which is normal. However, it contains a try-except block that attempts to execute a base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window flags if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The URL embedded in the comment and the encoded command indicate possible malicious activity, such as remote code execution or backdoor setup. The setup function itself appears legitimate but is likely a cover for the malicious activity executed earlier. The code demonstrates an attempt to hide malicious payloads within a seemingly benign setup script, with obfuscation via base64 encoding and hidden window flags.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell execution intended to run hidden commands, likely malicious. The setup function is probably a decoy or cover. The presence of encoded commands and hidden execution strongly indicates malicious intent and potential backdoor or remote control capabilities.",
