  "purpose": "Analyze the supply chain security and potential malicious behavior of the open source dependency code.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external data flows, potentially dangerous functions like eval()/exec(), network or file operations.",
  "sinks": "System/network calls, data exfiltration points, code execution functions, environment variables, untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like eval()/exec() or network functions, possibly via intermediate variables or functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec(), obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, minimal or empty code snippets, incomplete code, suspicious data handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets generally show benign, straightforward behavior with no suspicious patterns or external data flows. Reports indicating potential untrusted data sources and functions like eval()/exec() suggest moderate suspicion, reflected in malware scores around 0.4. In cases with no code or minimal code, confidence in benignity is high, with scores close to zero. Slight adjustments to scores are considered based on the presence of potential data handling issues or incomplete code. Overall, the scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with the main concern in report 2 regarding untrusted data handling and potential code execution, warranting a malware score around 0.4–0.5 if confirmed. The security risks are generally low but slightly elevated in reports with potential data flow concerns. Obfuscation appears minimal across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code and reports mostly indicate benign or incomplete code with low malicious potential. Suspicion is primarily in report 2 due to potential unsafe data handling, which justifies a moderate malware score. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, and no significant revisions are necessary. The risk remains low, with cautious consideration of untrusted data sources.",
