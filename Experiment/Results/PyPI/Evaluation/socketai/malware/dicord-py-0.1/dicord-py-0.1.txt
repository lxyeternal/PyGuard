      "conclusion": "The analyzed code and reports mostly indicate benign or incomplete code with low malicious potential. Suspicion is primarily in report 2 due to potential unsafe data handling, which justifies a moderate malware score. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, and no significant revisions are necessary. The risk remains low, with cautious consideration of untrusted data sources."
