  "purpose": "The script appears to collect system information, user credentials from browsers, external IP, geolocation, and then uploads collected data to a Discord webhook. It also downloads and executes external files, potentially maliciously.",
  "sources": [
    "Reading environment variables (e.g., 'USERNAME', 'LOCALAPPDATA')",
    "Network requests to external URLs for IP, geolocation, files, and downloads",
    "Accessing browser login data SQLite files",

    "Reading process and user info via psutil",

  "flows": [
    "Network request to download malware/executable files -> Save to TEMP -> Execute via subprocess/os.system",
    "Network request to IP and geolocation APIs -> Save data to file -> Upload to webhook",
    "Browser login data -> Read via SQLite -> Save credentials -> Upload to webhook",

  "anomalies": [
    "Downloading and executing files from unverified external URLs (SourceForge, Bitbucket)",
    "Potentially suspicious use of external IP and geolocation info without user consent",
    "Access to browser login databases to extract credentials",
    "Uploading system info, credentials, and files to external Discord webhook, possibly exfiltrating data",
    "Use of os.system to start a downloaded executable",
    "Code that appears to be designed for persistence and data theft, with no obvious benign purpose"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code collects extensive system information, including OS details, network configuration, running processes, logged-in users, browser saved passwords, and external IP/geolocation data. It downloads multiple files, including executables, from external sources and runs them, which is characteristic of malware. The collected data, including credentials and system info, is uploaded to a Discord webhook, indicating potential exfiltration. The script employs common methods for data collection, exfiltration, and remote execution, consistent with malicious activity. No benign purpose is evident; the behavior aligns with typical spyware or trojan-like scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits multiple malicious behaviors, including credential theft, remote code execution, data exfiltration, and downloading/executing files from untrusted sources. It strongly indicates malicious intent and should not be used.",
