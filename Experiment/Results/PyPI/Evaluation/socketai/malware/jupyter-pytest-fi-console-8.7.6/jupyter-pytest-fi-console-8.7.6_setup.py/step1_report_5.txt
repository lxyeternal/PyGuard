  "analysis": "The code is designed to collect detailed system and network data, including browser credentials, then exfiltrate this data via a Discord webhook. It downloads executable files from suspicious sources, executes them, and manages sensitive information without clear user consent. These behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent, including data theft, system compromise, and remote control capabilities. No evidence of obfuscation, but the behavior pattern and hardcoded webhook and URL endpoints are highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This script demonstrates clear malicious intent, involving data exfiltration, execution of remote payloads, and collection of sensitive user data. It should be classified as malware, with a high security risk. The code contains no obfuscation, but its operations are malicious and dangerous.",
