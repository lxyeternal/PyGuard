      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup. The activity is consistent with malware behavior, warranting caution and further analysis. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; I recommend treating this package as potentially malicious until the payload can be decoded and verified."
