      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, stealthy execution of a potentially malicious PowerShell command during package setup, with suspicious external references and error suppression. The high scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. This package poses a significant security threat and should be flagged for further analysis or removal."
