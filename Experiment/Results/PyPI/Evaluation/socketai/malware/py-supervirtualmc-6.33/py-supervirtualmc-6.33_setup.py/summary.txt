  "conclusion": "The package contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated, and silently executed PowerShell command during setup, indicating malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be flagged for removal or further investigation. The scores provided are appropriate; I recommend slightly increasing the obfuscation and risk scores for a more conservative stance."
