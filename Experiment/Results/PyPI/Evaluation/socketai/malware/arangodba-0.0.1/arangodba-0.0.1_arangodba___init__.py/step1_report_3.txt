{
  "purpose": "Importing a module named 'main', likely to execute its code or access its functions.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import main' reads the 'main' module, which may contain executable code or functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are evident; no untrusted data handling or external communication shown.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing the 'main' module, which may execute code upon import if the module runs code at the top level.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not show suspicious patterns; however, importing 'main' could trigger hidden code execution if 'main' runs code at import time.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports the 'main' module. If 'main' executes code at import, it could perform malicious actions without further input. No additional context is provided. The minimal nature of the code makes it unlikely to contain obfuscated or malicious code directly but depends on the contents of 'main'.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet by itself is not overtly malicious but warrants caution if 'main' contains malicious code or executes malicious actions upon import. Without inspecting 'main', the risk cannot be fully determined.",
