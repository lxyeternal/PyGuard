  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of importing the 'main' module in Python, considering potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import main' which loads the 'main' module, executing its top-level code if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of malicious code within 'main' during import, leading to code execution, data leakage, or side effects.",
  "flows": "Importing 'main' (source) triggers execution of its top-level code (sink), which may perform malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with only an import statement; no anomalies within this snippet. The risk depends entirely on 'main's content.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement, which in Python executes the top-level code of 'main'. The risk assessment hinges on whether 'main' contains malicious code. All reports correctly identify that the import could trigger malicious behavior if 'main' is malicious. The malware score is conservatively set to 0 due to lack of evidence, and the security risk score is low (0.2), reflecting the potential for code execution during import. The confidence score is moderate (0.4), acknowledging uncertainty about 'main's trustworthiness. No obfuscation is detected. The scores are consistent with the minimal code and cautious analysis, emphasizing that the actual risk depends on the content of 'main'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation; the primary concern is the content of 'main'. Current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the minimal code snippet and the unknown nature of 'main'. Further inspection of 'main' is necessary for a definitive security assessment.",
