{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'main' module, likely to execute its main functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing the 'main' module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present in this snippet; potential risks depend on what 'main' does upon import.",
  "flows": "Importing 'main' can trigger its execution if the module executes code at the top level.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of context; no explicit code or data handling shown. Importing a module with no additional code is minimal but could be malicious if 'main' contains harmful code.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs an import of the 'main' module. Since no further code is provided, we cannot determine if 'main' contains malicious behavior. The import could trigger execution if 'main' runs code at import time. Without inspecting 'main', the risk remains uncertain. No suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets are evident in this snippet. The simplicity suggests low likelihood of malicious intent unless 'main' is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. However, because importing a module can execute code if the module has top-level statements, there is a potential risk if 'main' is malicious. Overall, the code is minimal and unlikely to be harmful by itself but depends on the content of 'main'.",
