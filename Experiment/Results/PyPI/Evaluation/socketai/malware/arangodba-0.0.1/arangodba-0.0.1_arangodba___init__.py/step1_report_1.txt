{
  "purpose": "Importing the main module, likely to execute or access its functions.",
  "sources": "The import statement imports the main module; no direct input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands observed.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the import could trigger code execution if main has side effects.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains a single import statement with no additional context or function calls, which is unusual if it's the entire code. Potentially, the main module could execute code upon import if designed to do so.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'main', which may execute code during import if 'main' runs code at the top level. No other code, functions, or data handling is present. Without seeing the content of 'main', it's difficult to determine if malicious behavior exists. The import alone is benign, but it could trigger malicious actions if 'main' is malicious or contains code that executes on import.",
  "conclusion": "This minimal code simply imports the 'main' module. On its own, it does not contain malicious behavior, but the overall risk depends on the content of 'main'. The code's simplicity suggests low suspicion unless 'main' is known to be malicious.",
