  "purpose": "Importing the main module, likely for execution or initialization of the program.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the main module from the project or environment.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks within this code snippet; potential risks depend on what 'main' does when imported.",
  "flows": "Importing 'main' may trigger code execution within the main module, which could lead to further source-to-sink flows depending on its contents.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies are visible here. The import statement itself is standard, but without inspecting 'main', the risk cannot be fully assessed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'main'. This could be benign, used for starting an application, or malicious if 'main' contains harmful code. Since only the import statement is present, there's no direct evidence of malicious behavior. However, the risk depends entirely on the contents of the 'main' module, which are not provided. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are visible at this level.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a simple import statement with no inherent malicious behavior. The security assessment of the overall code depends on the content of the 'main' module, which is not available here. Therefore, no definitive malicious or suspicious activity can be determined from this snippet alone.",
