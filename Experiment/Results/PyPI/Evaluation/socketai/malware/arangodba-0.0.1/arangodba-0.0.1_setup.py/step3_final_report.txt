{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates the current system username to an obfuscated external URL during package import, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The `os.popen('whoami').read()` call retrieves the system username; the base64-encoded URL is decoded at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The `requests.post()` function sends the collected username to the decoded URL, transmitting potentially sensitive data externally.",
  "flows": "The code decodes the URL, retrieves the username, and immediately posts this data to the external server during module import.",
  "anomalies": "The URL is obfuscated via base64 encoding; data exfiltration occurs during package import without user consent; the network request is embedded in module-level code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, decodes an obfuscated URL, collects the system username via `os.popen('whoami')`, and sends this data to the decoded URL using `requests.post()`. The package setup code appears standard and benign. The network activity during import and the URL obfuscation are suspicious indicators of malicious behavior. The data exfiltration is a clear privacy violation, and the obfuscation suggests an intent to hide malicious activity. No other malicious code or backdoors are present. The activity is consistent with malicious data theft, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-confidence malicious behavior through obfuscated data exfiltration during package import. The activity is suspicious, potentially harmful, and warrants high malware and security risk scores.",
