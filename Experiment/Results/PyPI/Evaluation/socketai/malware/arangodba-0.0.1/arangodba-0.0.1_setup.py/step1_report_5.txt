{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'arangodba' with an embedded malicious network request to exfiltrate system information.",
  "sources": "Reading system command output via os.popen('whoami') and decoding a base64-encoded URL for network request.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() to a decoded URL with system info, potentially exfiltrating data to an external server.",
  "flows": "System command output ('whoami') is captured and sent via a POST request to a server whose URL is decoded from base64, indicating data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded URL used for obfuscated network communication; direct use of os.popen() for system info; no legitimate reason for network activity in a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, then decodes a base64-encoded URL and sends the current user info via POST request to that URL. The URL is obfuscated, indicating an attempt to hide malicious activity. The network request occurs during module import, which is suspicious. The setup configuration appears normal but is likely used to mask malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it exfiltrates system information to an external server during package setup. The URL is obfuscated, and system info is captured without user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
