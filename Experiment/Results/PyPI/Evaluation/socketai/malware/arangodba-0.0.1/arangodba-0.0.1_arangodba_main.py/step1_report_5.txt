  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated elements, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a simple function that prints a greeting. It includes standard boilerplate code to run the function with a hardcoded argument. No external data sources, network activity, or sensitive operations are present. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serves a basic greeting purpose, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
