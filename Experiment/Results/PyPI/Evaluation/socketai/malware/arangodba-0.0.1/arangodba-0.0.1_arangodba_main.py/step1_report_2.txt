{
  "purpose": "The script is a simple example program that prints a greeting message with a provided name.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'name' parameter passed to the print_hi function and the string 'PyCharm' used in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs data to the console; there are no data leaks or untrusted sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input source (parameter 'name') flows into the print function, which outputs it to the console; the hardcoded string 'PyCharm' is also printed.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns. No external input handling or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that prints a greeting with a given name. It then executes this function with a hardcoded argument. No external input is processed, no network activity, no sensitive data handling, and no obfuscated or malicious code is present. The structure and content are typical of a basic educational or example script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a straightforward greeting script with no suspicious behavior.",
