  "purpose": "A simple script that prints a greeting message.",
  "sources": "Input is taken indirectly via function parameters; no explicit external data sources or user input.",
  "sinks": "Standard output through print function; no data leaks or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Function receives a name parameter and outputs it via print, with no external data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function print_hi that prints a greeting. It is invoked only if the script is run as main, passing a fixed string 'PyCharm'. No external input, no network operations, no use of environment variables, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is basic and does not contain any hidden or malicious logic. It appears to be a standard template or example script.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, straightforward script with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to print a greeting message and contains no suspicious or malicious code.",
