  "purpose": "A simple Python script that prints a greeting message using a provided name.",
  "sources": "The function print_hi receives the 'name' parameter; the main block calls print_hi with a static string.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output; no untrusted data sources or external sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "The 'name' parameter flows directly into the print statement; no external data sources or untrusted inputs are used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that prints a greeting. It is invoked with a static string, with no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code's simplicity and controlled input make it benign. All reports correctly identify the lack of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward greeting script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
