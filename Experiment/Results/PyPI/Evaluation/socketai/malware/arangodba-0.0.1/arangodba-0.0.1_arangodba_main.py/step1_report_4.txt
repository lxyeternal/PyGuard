  "purpose": "A simple script that prints a greeting message.",
  "sources": "Input source is the function parameter 'name', which is used in the print statement.",
  "sinks": "The print function outputs data to the console; no data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' flows into the print statement, but this is a controlled parameter without external untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets observed. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function 'print_hi' that prints a greeting. It is invoked with a hardcoded string 'PyCharm' when the script runs as main. There are no external data inputs, no network activity, no use of environment variables, and no third-party libraries. No potential security issues, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, simple example script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a basic greeting program with no harmful behavior.",
