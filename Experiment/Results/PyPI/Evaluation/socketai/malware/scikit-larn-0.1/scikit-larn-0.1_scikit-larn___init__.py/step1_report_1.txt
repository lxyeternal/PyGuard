  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided or visible, making it unclear what the code intends to do.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input, environment variables, and possibly external modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but specifics are not clear without the actual code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to sinks through various processing functions; without specific code, the exact paths are unknown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are identified due to lack of visible code.",
  "analysis": "Due to absence of code content, analysis is limited. The structure and format do not show any overt malicious patterns, but without the actual code, it’s impossible to confirm behaviors. The code might be benign or malicious; further details are required for definitive assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to definitively identify malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard based on the limited available context, but more details are needed for an accurate evaluation.",
