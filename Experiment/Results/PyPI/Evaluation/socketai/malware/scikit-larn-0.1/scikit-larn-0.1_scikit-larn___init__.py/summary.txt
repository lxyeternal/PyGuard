  "conclusion": "Based on the limited information, there is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The use of dynamic execution functions warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk remains low (around 0.2), and malware and obfuscation scores are justified at 0. All reports are consistent and appropriately cautious given the available data."
