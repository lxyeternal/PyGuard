{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, username, current directory, package name), encodes it, splits it into parts, and exfiltrates it covertly via DNS queries (pinging crafted domains) and HTTP requests (POST and GET), employing obfuscation techniques.",
  "sources": "os.uname().nodename, os.environ['COMPUTERNAME'], getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "os.system('ping ...'), urllib.request.urlopen, requests.post, requests.get, urllib.urlopen",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from sources, encoded in base64 and hex, split into parts, then transmitted via DNS (pinging domains with embedded data) and HTTP (POST/GET requests with encoded data).",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple network libraries, redundant try-except blocks suppressing errors, encoding data in hex/base64, and transmission via DNS pinging and HTTP requests suggest obfuscation and covert exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs system info collection, encoding, splitting, and covert transmission through DNS and HTTP channels. It employs multiple encoding layers and network methods to obfuscate data exfiltration. The network requests and data handling are consistent with malicious data theft techniques. No destructive payloads or backdoors are present; the primary activity is covert data exfiltration, which is malicious. The use of multiple network libraries and encoding indicates obfuscation. The code's behavior aligns with typical malware designed for stealthy data theft. The high frequency of network requests, suppression of errors, and data encoding all point to malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for covert data exfiltration via DNS and HTTP channels, employing obfuscation techniques. It lacks legitimate purpose and poses a high security risk. The malware score is 0.85, obfuscation score 0.7, and security risk score 0.9, reflecting its malicious and covert nature.",
