  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'xgoogle_cloud_core'.",
  "sources": "The 'find_packages()' function that dynamically locates Python packages in the directory.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; typical setup invocation does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present; standard package setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, then calls setup() with name, version, and packages parameters. It is a typical setup.py script used for packaging Python modules. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is present. The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or execution beyond packaging configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
