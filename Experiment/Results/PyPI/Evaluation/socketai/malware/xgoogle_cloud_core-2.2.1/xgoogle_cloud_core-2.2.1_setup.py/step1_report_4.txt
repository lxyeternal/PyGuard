  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the Python package 'xgoogle_cloud_core'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and configuration data via 'setup' and 'find_packages()'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive functions or sinks; the code simply invokes setup procedures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be a straightforward setup configuration without obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, then calls 'setup' with package name, version, and found packages. It does not include any dynamic code, external data input, or suspicious commands. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious code behavior is evident. The structure and syntax are standard for Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks present.",
