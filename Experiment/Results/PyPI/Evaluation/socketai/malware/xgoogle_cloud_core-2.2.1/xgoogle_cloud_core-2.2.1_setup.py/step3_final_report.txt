  "purpose": "Standard packaging setup script for a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Import statements from setuptools, call to setup() with package name, version, and find_packages() for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external inputs, or network operations present; no data leaks or malicious data flows.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code is static and does not process external data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, conventional setup.py script that imports setup and find_packages from setuptools and invokes setup() with package metadata. It performs no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores. The code's simplicity and standard structure confirm the absence of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script for packaging a Python module. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
