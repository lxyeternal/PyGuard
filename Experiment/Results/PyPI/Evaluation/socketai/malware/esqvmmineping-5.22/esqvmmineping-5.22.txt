      "conclusion": "The code contains embedded malicious activity—specifically, an obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during package installation, contacting a suspicious URL. This represents a high security threat, consistent with supply chain sabotage or backdoor behavior. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriate and should be treated as malicious."
