      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the obfuscated, hidden execution of a PowerShell command during package setup. While the exact payload cannot be confirmed without decoding, the obfuscation and stealth tactics are indicative of malicious or backdoor behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75, obfuscated ~0.85, security risk ~0.8) are justified and consistent with this assessment."
