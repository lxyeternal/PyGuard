{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs basic mathematical operations and prints the results.",
  "sources": "Input is indirectly received through function arguments or hardcoded values within the script.",
  "sinks": "The script outputs results via print statements; no untrusted data is sent over the network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from variable assignments and function parameters through calculations to output via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or unusual code constructs. The code is straightforward and simple.",
  "analysis": "The script performs basic arithmetic operations and outputs the results. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code structure is clear, with no suspicious imports or dynamic execution. No unusual or misleading code patterns are detected. The simplicity reduces the likelihood of embedded malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing basic calculations without any malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no indicators of security risks or malware within this code fragment.",
