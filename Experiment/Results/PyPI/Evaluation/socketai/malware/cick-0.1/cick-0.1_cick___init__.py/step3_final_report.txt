{
  "purpose": "The code is a simple Python script performing basic arithmetic operations, with no suspicious features or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data is not explicitly read; the code performs internal calculations without external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable interactions are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code is straightforward and does not process untrusted input data that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is simple, direct, and free of obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic arithmetic operations, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The simplicity and clarity of the code support a benign assessment. No external interactions or data leaks are evident. The lack of code in some snippets limits confidence but does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
