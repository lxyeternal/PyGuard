{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function 'ina()' that prints 'installed' and calls it, serving as a basic informational or placeholder script.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only executes a static print statement within a function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The source is the function 'ina()' invocation; it flows directly to the print statement which outputs static text; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static script with no external inputs, no dynamic behavior, and no obfuscation. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with confidence 1. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain vulnerabilities. The logic is clear, and the code’s simplicity confirms the absence of security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports are accurate and appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
