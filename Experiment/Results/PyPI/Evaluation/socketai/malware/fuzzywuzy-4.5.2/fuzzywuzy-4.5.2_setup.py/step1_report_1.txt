{
  "purpose": "The script defines a setup process for a Python package, with additional code executed during installation to perform external requests and possibly download and execute a file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded executable is saved locally and then executed via os.system, potentially running malicious code.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent to a remote URL; if on Windows, a file is downloaded from a suspicious URL and executed, creating a flow from input to remote exfiltration and local code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The 'send' function sends system information to an external server and then downloads and executes an executable from a suspicious domain, which is highly unusual for a setup script. The URL domains appear suspicious and unrelated to standard package behavior. The use of 'os.system' to run the downloaded file is dangerous.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules. The 'send' function attempts to access an environment variable and send its value to a remote server. It then conditionally downloads an executable file from a suspicious URL and executes it. This behavior is not typical for package setup scripts and indicates potential malicious intent, such as system compromise or backdoor installation. The code runs during the installation process via a custom command class. The overall structure suggests an attempt to exfiltrate system data and execute arbitrary code on the host machine. No other security issues, such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscation, are evident beyond these malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior aimed at exfiltrating system information, downloading, and executing arbitrary malware during package installation. It appears intentionally designed for compromise, which is highly suspicious and dangerous.",
