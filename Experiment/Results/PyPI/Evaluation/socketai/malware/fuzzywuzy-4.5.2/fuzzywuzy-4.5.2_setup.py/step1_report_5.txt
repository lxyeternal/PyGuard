{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package installation process, with an additional post-installation step that attempts to send environment information and download and execute an external executable.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', the URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation new c kw ' concatenated with 'COMPUTERNAME', and the URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' for downloading executable.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get calls transmitting environment info and downloading content, and os.system('start '+filename) executing downloaded file.",
  "flows": "Code reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> sends data via HTTP GET request -> downloads executable from external URL -> executes downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration by sending environment variable data to an external server. It downloads and runs an executable from a suspicious URL, which may be malicious. The try-except block suppresses errors, hiding potential failures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup-related modules and requests, then defines a function 'send' that exfiltrates the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable to an external server. It also downloads an executable from a suspicious domain and executes it without validation. The custom 'PostInstallCommand' runs 'send' after installation. The overall flow involves data collection, data exfiltration, and remote code execution, indicating malicious intent. The setup configuration itself appears normal, but the embedded 'send' function and post-install behavior are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it exfiltrates environment data and downloads/executed external malware without user consent. It is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
