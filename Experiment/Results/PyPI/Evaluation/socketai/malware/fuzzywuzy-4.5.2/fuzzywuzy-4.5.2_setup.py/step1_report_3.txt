{
  "purpose": "Set up and install the 'fuzzywuzy' package, with an added post-installation step that executes a remote request and possibly downloads and executes a file.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', and external URLs via requests.get() calls.",
  "sinks": "Downloading and executing a file ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') via os.system('start '+filename), which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent to a remote server via a GET request, then a file is downloaded from a suspicious URL and executed locally.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional try-except that suppresses errors, use of requests to send environment data, and automatic execution of downloaded executable without validation. The code downloads and runs an executable from a suspicious URL during installation, which is highly unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and requests, then defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a remote server via a GET request. If running on Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious domain and executes it immediately. The PostInstallCommand class overrides the 'run' method to invoke 'send' after installation. The setup() call registers this custom command for the install process. The behavior of sending system info to an external server and then downloading and executing an untrusted executable during package installation is suspicious and potentially malicious. This could be used for malicious payload delivery, remote code execution, or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a malicious pattern: it collects environment data, communicates with a remote server, and downloads/executed a potentially harmful executable during installation. These behaviors are indicative of supply chain malware or malicious activity. The package should not be used in its current form.",
