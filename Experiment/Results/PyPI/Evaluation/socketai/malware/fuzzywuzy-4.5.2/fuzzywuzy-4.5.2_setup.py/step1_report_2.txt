{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package installation process with a custom post-installation step that attempts to send environment data and download an executable file from a remote server.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', and URLs in the send() function for HTTP GET requests.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, execution of downloaded executable via os.system('start '+filename).",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent via a GET request, then an executable is downloaded and executed on Windows systems.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional try-except block suppressing all errors, downloading and executing an external executable during installation, use of 'os.system' with user-controlled filename, and sending system info to an external server.",
  "analysis": "The code's send() function retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to an external URL, potentially leaking user data. It then downloads an executable from a suspicious domain and attempts to execute it silently. The use of try-except without handling exceptions conceals failures. The setup process integrates this behavior into package installation via a custom command class. These actions resemble malicious activities such as data exfiltration and remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information and executing an external payload during package installation, indicating potential supply chain attack or malware distribution. It should be considered highly malicious.",
