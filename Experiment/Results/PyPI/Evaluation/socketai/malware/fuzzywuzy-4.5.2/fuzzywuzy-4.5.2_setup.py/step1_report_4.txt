  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with an additional post-installation behavior.",
  "sources": "os.environ['COMPUTERNAME'], requests.get() calls to external URLs, os.system() for executing downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() for external data, os.system() to execute downloaded file.",
  "flows": "Reading 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> sending data to external URL -> downloading and executing an external file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except block swallowing all exceptions, downloading and executing an external executable during installation, no validation of external sources, suspicious URL domains, executing downloaded files without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to send the COMPUTERNAME environment variable to an external URL, which could be used for tracking or data collection. It then downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it via os.system. The code is triggered during package installation through a custom post-install command. These behaviors resemble malicious activity, such as data exfiltration and remote code execution. The URLs used appear suspicious, and executing a downloaded file without user confirmation is a security risk. Overall, the code performs actions that could compromise system security and privacy.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment data and executing an external payload during installation. It poses a significant security risk and should be considered malicious.",
