{
  "purpose": "A wrapper around OpenSSL library for SSL and cryptography operations, with additional code to download and execute a file.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlretrieve to download external file; tempfile.gettempdir() to determine temporary directory.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call to execute downloaded file (package.exe).",
  "flows": "Download from URL -> Save to temp directory -> Execute the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Download of an executable file from a suspicious URL and immediate execution without validation or verification; use of shell=True in subprocess call increases risk of command injection.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves a file from a potentially malicious URL and executes it directly without any validation, checksum, or security checks. This behavior indicates intentional malicious activity, such as installing malware or backdoors. The use of subprocess.call with shell=True further increases the risk of command injection, especially if the filename could be manipulated. The code appears to be designed to silently download and execute a potentially harmful executable, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks or malware distribution. The rest of the code related to OpenSSL and version info is benign and standard, but the critical malicious action is the download and execution step.",
  "conclusion": "The code explicitly downloads and executes a file from an external URL without verification, indicating malicious intent. This behavior could result in system compromise or malware infection. Overall, the code demonstrates high malicious potential.",
