{
  "purpose": "Provides routines for managing and reseeding the OpenSSL CSPRNG, specifically adding entropy and checking seed status.",
  "sources": "User-provided buffer input for the 'add' function, specifically the 'buffer' argument.",
  "sinks": "The '_lib.RAND_add' and '_lib.RAND_status' functions, which interact with OpenSSL's internal PRNG.",
  "flows": "Input buffer from user → add() function → _lib.RAND_add (seeding entropy); status check → _lib.RAND_status",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code straightforwardly wraps OpenSSL C functions.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a thin wrapper around OpenSSL's PRNG management functions. It allows adding entropy to the CSPRNG and checking its seed status. It validates input types but does not process or transmit data externally. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden network activity, or backdoors. It simply interfaces with the OpenSSL library for secure randomness management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign wrapper for OpenSSL PRNG management routines. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, merely providing entropy management functions. No security risks are evident.",
