{
  "purpose": "Provides routines for managing and reseeding the OpenSSL PRNG to ensure sufficient entropy, mainly for use after process forking.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'buffer' in the add() function, which accepts external byte data; no other data sources present.",
  "targets": "Calls to _lib.RAND_add() and _lib.RAND_status(), which interface with OpenSSL's randomness functions.",
  "flows": "External data (buffer) flows into the _lib.RAND_add() function as entropy input; status checks flow from _lib.RAND_status() to the caller.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. Use of OpenSSL's internal functions is standard for PRNG management.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a thin wrapper around OpenSSL's PRNG functions, providing mechanisms to add entropy and check seed status. It performs input validation for buffer type and entropy type, then calls the underlying C library functions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The functions are well-documented and serve a specific, legitimate purpose related to cryptographic security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and safe wrapper for managing OpenSSL's PRNG. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. The functions are correctly implemented for their intended purpose, with proper input validation. Overall, the code poses no security risk.",
