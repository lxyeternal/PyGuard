{
  "purpose": "Manage and update the OpenSSL CSPRNG state by adding entropy and checking seed status.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'buffer' in add() function; internal _lib.RAND_add and _lib.RAND_status calls.",
  "sinks": "None identified; functions call OpenSSL C API functions but do not leak data externally.",
  "flows": "User supplies 'buffer' -> add() function processes and passes to OpenSSL RAND_add; status() retrieves seed status from OpenSSL.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is a thin wrapper around OpenSSL C functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to add entropy to and check the status of OpenSSL's PRNG. It validates input types but does not handle untrusted data beyond the entropy input. The functions are standard and documented for seed management, especially relevant after process forks. No external data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code is present. The code does not perform any network activity or system modification beyond interfacing with OpenSSL's RNG.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a legitimate wrapper for OpenSSL's CSPRNG management functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose in entropy management. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
