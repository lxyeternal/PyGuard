  "purpose": "Manage and reseed the OpenSSL cryptographic pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) by adding entropy and checking seed status.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'buffer' (bytes) for entropy data, 'entropy' (int) measurement of randomness.",
  "sinks": "Calls to OpenSSL's internal functions (_lib.RAND_add and _lib.RAND_status) with no external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Input 'buffer' and 'entropy' flow into _lib.RAND_add; 'status()' queries _lib.RAND_status() to assess seed state.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, well-documented wrapper around OpenSSL's PRNG functions, performing input validation and calling standard cryptographic library routines. It does not process or transmit data externally, nor does it contain any malicious or suspicious logic. The purpose aligns with cryptographic best practices for entropy management, especially after process forking. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, low security risk around 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of this utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard wrapper for OpenSSL's PRNG management functions, with proper validation and no malicious intent. It poses minimal security risk and contains no obfuscation or malicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
