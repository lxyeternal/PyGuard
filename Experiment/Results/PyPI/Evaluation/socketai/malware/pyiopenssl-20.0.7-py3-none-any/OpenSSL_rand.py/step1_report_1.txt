{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for managing the PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generator) state using OpenSSL, specifically for adding entropy and checking seed status.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'buffer' parameter in the add() function, which is supplied externally by the caller.",
  "sinks": "The code calls OpenSSL C library functions (_lib.RAND_add and _lib.RAND_status), which influence the internal PRNG state; no direct data leaks or external outputs are observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'buffer' and 'entropy' flow into _lib.RAND_add, affecting the internal PRNG state. The status() function retrieves the seed status from _lib.RAND_status without external data output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no hidden behaviors are present. The code simply wraps OpenSSL PRNG functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around OpenSSL functions for adding entropy and checking seed status. It validates input types but does not process or transmit data beyond the library calls. No malware-like behavior or malicious code is evident. The functions are standard for cryptographic entropy management, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for managing PRNG entropy using OpenSSL. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard implementation with appropriate input validation.",
