  "purpose": "The code collects and displays environment information related to OpenSSL, cryptography, cffi, and Python runtime details.",
  "sources": "Reads data from imported modules' version attributes, sys module (executable, version, platform, sys.path).",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs environment info; no data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Source: module attributes and sys module data -> Sink: print output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and informational.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers version info from cryptography, cffi, OpenSSL, and Python, formats it into a string, and prints it. All operations are read-only data retrievals with no untrusted input handling or data transmission. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security-critical operations are present. The code appears to be diagnostic or informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment information reporter without malicious intent or security risks.",
