{
  "purpose": "Collects environment and version information related to OpenSSL, cryptography, cffi, and Python, then prints it.",
  "sources": "Reads static attributes from imported modules and system variables (e.g., version info, sys.executable, sys.version, sys.platform, sys.path).",
  "sinks": "Outputs the formatted environment info string via print().",
  "flows": "Data flows from module attributes and system info into a string, then is printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, gathers static version and environment info, formats it into a string, and prints it. No network activity, user input, or data exfiltration occurs. The purpose appears diagnostic and benign. All signals point to a straightforward environment info collector with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment diagnostic script that gathers and displays system and library version info. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior. The existing scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1—are appropriate and justified given its functionality.",
