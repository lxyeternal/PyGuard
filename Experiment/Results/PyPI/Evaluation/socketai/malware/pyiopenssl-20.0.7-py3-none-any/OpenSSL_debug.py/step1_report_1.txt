{
  "purpose": "The code gathers environment and library version information related to OpenSSL, cryptography, cffi, and Python, and prints this info.",
  "sources": "The code reads system environment variables, module attributes, and system paths; primarily gathers version info from imported modules and system attributes.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs the collected environment info to standard output, which could be captured or monitored.",
  "flows": "Data flows from module attributes and system variables into the _env_info string, which is then printed.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not perform any unusual operations, obfuscation, or hidden behavior. It primarily collects and displays version info.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard security-related libraries and gathers detailed environment and library version information. It uses standard methods to access version strings and system info. No hardcoded secrets, user input processing, or network communication occurs. The output could be used for auditing or debugging purposes, but it does not involve suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign environment information collector, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It only outputs version and system info without performing any harmful actions.",
