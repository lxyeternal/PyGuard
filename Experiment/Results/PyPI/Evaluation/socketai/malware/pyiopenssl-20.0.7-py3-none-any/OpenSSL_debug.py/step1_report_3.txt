{
  "purpose": "The code gathers environment information about the Python runtime, cryptography libraries, OpenSSL versions, and system details, then prints this information.",
  "sources": "Data is collected from various modules such as 'sys', 'cryptography', 'OpenSSL', and the package's 'version' module.",
  "sinks": "The information is printed directly to standard output using 'print()'.",
  "flows": "Data from environment modules flows into the '_env_info' string formatting, then flows to the 'print' function for output.",
  "anomalies": "The code simply reports system and library information without performing any unusual or suspicious operations. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. No external network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports security-related libraries but only gathers and prints version and environment information. It constructs a descriptive string with version details and outputs it. No input validation, data processing, or external data transfer occurs. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No backdoors, network activity, or data leaks are present. It appears to be diagnostic or informational in purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for environment introspection. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply outputs version and system details without performing any harmful actions.",
