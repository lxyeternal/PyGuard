  "purpose": "To gather and display environment and library version information related to OpenSSL, cryptography, cffi, and Python.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from imported libraries, sys.executable, sys.version, sys.platform, and sys.path.",
  "targets": "Prints the collected environment information to standard output.",
  "flows": "Imports libraries -> Collects version info -> Formats string -> Prints to console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the code straightforwardly gathers environment info without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple security-related libraries and gathers detailed version information about them, along with Python and platform details. It then formats this data into a string and prints it. There are no signs of malicious data collection, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code execution. The purpose appears to be environment reporting, which is common in diagnostic tools.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign environment information collector with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any harmful operations or data exfiltration.",
