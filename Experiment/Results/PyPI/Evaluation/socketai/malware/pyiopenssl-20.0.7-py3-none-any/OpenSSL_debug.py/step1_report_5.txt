{
  "purpose": "The script gathers and prints environment and version information related to OpenSSL, cryptography, cffi, and Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via sys, ssl, and package version attributes; constructs a formatted string with this info.",
  "sinks": "The final print statement outputs the environment info to the console; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from package attributes and system variables, formatted into a string, then printed to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. Usage of version info collection is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules to access version and environment information, formats this data into a multi-line string, and prints it. It does not perform network operations, execute untrusted input, or contain obfuscated code. The script's purpose appears to be environment introspection, which is common for debugging or informational purposes. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely collects and displays environment and version information related to cryptography and Python runtime. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign environment diagnostic script.",
