  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content**:\n   - The code is purely metadata: defining variables like `__version__`, `__author__`, `__license__`, etc.\n   - No functions, no dynamic code, no user input handling, no external data processing.\n   - No network activity, no obfuscation, no embedded payloads.\n   - The code is standard for a Python package's `__init__.py` or metadata module.\n\n2. **Review of Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, and contains no malicious or suspicious constructs.\n   - They confirm that the code is solely declarative, with no data flows from untrusted sources, no sinks, and no anomalies.\n   - The confidence level in all reports is high (1), and they all assign malware and security risk scores of 0.\n\n3. **Potential Issues or Flaws**:\n   - No issues are present in the code.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n   - The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n   - Obfuscation is correctly scored as 0.\n   - The overall conclusion is that the code is benign.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is metadata only, there are no assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n   - No suspicious patterns or indicators of compromise are present.\n   - The code aligns with standard package metadata practices.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nAll evidence points to this being a benign, standard package metadata module with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The code is safe.\n- No further action needed.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
