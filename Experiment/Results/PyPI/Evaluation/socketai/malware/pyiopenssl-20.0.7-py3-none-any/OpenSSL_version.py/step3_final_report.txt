  "sources": "Static variable assignments defining package metadata; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static metadata with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with no functions, dynamic code, or external data handling. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The code aligns with standard practices for Python package metadata modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package metadata module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
