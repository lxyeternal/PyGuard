  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports describe the code as static metadata definitions for the pyOpenSSL package.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or external data handling is present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign and standard for package metadata.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports. Given the code's nature, this seems appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, which aligns with the straightforward, readable static assignments.\n- **Risk score:** all are 0, which is reasonable since no security issues are identified.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- No issues found in the code or the reports.\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The code is purely metadata with no malicious behavior.\n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores reflect this correctly.",
