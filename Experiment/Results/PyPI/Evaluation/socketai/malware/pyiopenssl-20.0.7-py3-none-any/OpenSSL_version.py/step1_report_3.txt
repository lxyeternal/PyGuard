  "purpose": "Define metadata for the pyOpenSSL Python wrapper module, including version, author, license, and other descriptive information.",
  "sources": "Static metadata definitions, such as version string, author, license, and URL assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no input/output handling or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Assignment statements setting module attributes from static strings and formatted strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward metadata declaration for the pyOpenSSL package. It imports no external data, performs no input/output operations, and only assigns static strings to module-level variables. The copyright and license information are standard, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident. All code appears to be boilerplate metadata documentation with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package metadata module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
