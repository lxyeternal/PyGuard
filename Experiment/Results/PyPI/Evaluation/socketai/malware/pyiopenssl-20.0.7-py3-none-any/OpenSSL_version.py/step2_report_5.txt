  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the provided code and reasoning.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as static metadata declarations, with no dynamic code, input handling, or external data processing.\n- The code snippets are straightforward assignments of package metadata variables, typical for Python package __init__.py or metadata modules.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with malware scores of 0 and security risks of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static metadata, with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors or flaws in the reasoning?**  \n  No. The reasoning in each report aligns with the code's content. The assessments are consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  - **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is appropriate, given the absence of malicious code.\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n  - **Security risk score:** 0 is appropriate; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Critical analysis:\n\n- The code is standard package metadata.  \n- No external data sources, no code execution, no network activity, no user input handling.  \n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Overall malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a typical package metadata module with no malicious or risky behavior. The reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately scored.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo further action needed.",
