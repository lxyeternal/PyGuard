  "purpose": "Define metadata for the pyOpenSSL package, including version, author, and licensing information.",
  "sources": "Read from module-level string assignments and metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "Initialization of metadata variables; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; standard package metadata definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata variable definitions and comments, with no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external network activity. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's metadata module. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code adheres to common practices for package metadata and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign metadata declaration for the pyOpenSSL package with no malicious behavior detected.",
