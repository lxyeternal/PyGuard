  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static values",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code solely declares static package metadata",
  "analysis": "The code imports no external modules, defines package metadata variables, and sets static string values. It does not read user input, environment variables, or external data. No functions or executable logic are present that could perform malicious actions. The code is standard for package metadata and contains no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative metadata for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
