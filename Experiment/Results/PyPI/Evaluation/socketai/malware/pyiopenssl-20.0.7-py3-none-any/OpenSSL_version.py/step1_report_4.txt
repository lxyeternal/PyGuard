{
  "purpose": "Defines metadata and version information for the pyOpenSSL package, serving as a module description and version control.",
  "sources": "Static attribute assignments and string literals defining package metadata.",
  "fires": "No dynamic data inputs, user inputs, or external data sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; metadata is statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of package metadata declarations including author, version, license, and other descriptive attributes. All values are statically assigned string literals or formatted strings. No external input handling, network communication, or data processing occurs. The code is straightforward, typical for a Python package's __init__.py or metadata module, and contains no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a metadata container for the pyOpenSSL package without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
