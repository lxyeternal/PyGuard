  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's structure, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes a comprehensive SSL/TLS interface with extensive callback handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Callback wrappers for verification, ALPN, OCSP, and cookies are standard; no hardcoded credentials or secrets. Environment variables for CA paths are typical but could be misused if misconfigured.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a standard, well-structured SSL binding. Callbacks are securely wrapped with exception handling, preventing crashes. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, with a very high confidence level (0.95). Malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and security risk is low (0.2). No reason to adjust scores.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing SSL wrapper with user callbacks.\n- **Anomalies:** Callback wrappers are standard; no hardcoded secrets. Environment variables and file paths are typical.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a legitimate SSL/TLS wrapper, with proper exception handling and resource management. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion:** High confidence (0.95), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar SSL wrapper, with focus on certificate handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; callbacks wrapped safely; standard environment variable usage.\n- **Analysis:** The code follows best practices, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** High confidence (0.9), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1. No changes necessary.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** SSL connection management with callbacks.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets; callbacks wrapped with exception handling; standard SSL patterns.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a typical, secure SSL wrapper. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** High confidence (0.9), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** SSL context and connection management with certificate and session handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; proper error handling; no suspicious data flows.\n- **Analysis:** The implementation is standard, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.\n- **Conclusion:** Very high confidence (0.95), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1. No changes necessary.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher (0.2) in reports 1 and 2, reflecting typical configuration complexity, but overall low.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** — reflects the complexity of SSL configurations but no immediate vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — the code is a legitimate SSL binding.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — standard SSL/TLS configuration risks, no signs of sabotage.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical, secure, well-implemented OpenSSL Python wrapper. Callback handling, error management, and resource management are appropriate. No malicious activity or sabotage is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type | Estimated Value |\n|--------------|------------------|\n| Malware      | 0                |\n| Obfuscated   | 0                |\n| Risk         | 0.1              |\n\nThis assessment is consistent with the detailed analysis above.",
