  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code provides a Python interface for SSL/TLS, with data flowing from sockets, environment variables, and files. No anomalies noted.\n- **Analysis:** Callback wrappers are standard, exception handling is robust, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. No signs of malicious payloads.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, well-structured, with low malware probability.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 (slightly cautious but reasonable given the callback complexity)\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with callbacks, environment variables, and certificate handling. Callback functions could execute arbitrary code.\n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, callbacks wrapped with exception handling, standard practices.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; code is a standard SSL wrapper.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 (reasonable)\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are consistent. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar scope, with certificate and session management, callbacks, and environment variables.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SSL/TLS wrapper, low malware risk.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - securityRisk: 0.1 (reasonable)\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on connection management, with environment variables, callbacks, and data flows typical for SSL libraries.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. Callbacks are wrapped with exception handling.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears secure, standard, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - securityRisk: 0.1 (appropriate)\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar SSL wrapper, with configuration, session, and callback management.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and callback handling is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, well-structured SSL/TLS interface.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - securityRisk: 0.1 (appropriate)\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports have 0, which is consistent with the code being a standard SSL wrapper.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, matching the transparent, explicit code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly cautious (0.1-0.2), which is reasonable given the callback complexity and environment variable usage but no signs of malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports; no signs of malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0; code is clear and explicit.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2; acceptable, given the nature of SSL/TLS code and callback handling.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThe code is a legitimate, comprehensive SSL/TLS Python binding with no indications of malicious activity or obfuscation. The callback wrappers are standard and include exception handling to prevent crashes, which is best practice. The low risk score reflects cautious confidence, appropriate for such a security-sensitive module.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are reasonable.
