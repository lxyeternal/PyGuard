  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the ForgePy Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static source definitions within the setup() function, no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'url' and 'license' fields, 'description' field contains an email address rather than descriptive text, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It specifies package metadata and dependencies, notably 'cryptography'. No dynamic code, input handling, or suspicious patterns are present. The 'author_email' and 'description' fields contain email addresses, which is unconventional but not malicious. There are no signs of obfuscated code, data leaks, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward package setup configuration with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The unusual metadata entries are likely oversight or placeholders but do not pose security concerns.",
