{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static fields in setup() such as name, version, packages, url, license, author, author_email, description, install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "The 'description' field contains an email address instead of descriptive text, which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static metadata. No dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or data leaks are present. The only irregularity is the email address in 'description', likely a placeholder or misconfiguration. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the static and transparent nature of the code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup configuration with a minor metadata anomaly. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
