      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by executing remote code during package setup on Windows, representing a high security threat. The behavior is consistent with malware or backdoor activity, justified by the remote code fetch and execution pattern, and obfuscation. It should be considered highly malicious and dangerous."
