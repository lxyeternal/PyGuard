  "purpose": "Setup script for Python package 'pydobc' that also performs remote notifications and potentially malicious installation actions during post-installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; URLs fetched via requests; execution of downloaded file using os.system.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs; execution of downloaded executable via os.system.",
  "flows": "Reading 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> sending data to a remote server -> downloading and executing a potentially malicious executable.",
  "anomalies": "Function 'send()' gathers environment info, sends it to a remote URL, downloads and runs an executable without user consent or validation. Use of broad exception handling suppresses errors, masking potential malicious activity. Downloaded executable filename and URL appear suspicious and untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then sends this data to a remote server. It also downloads an executable file from a suspicious URL and executes it without verification. This behavior indicates potential malicious activity, such as remote command and control, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The code runs during package installation via a custom post-install command, which is an unusual and risky practice. No benign functionality is apparent; all actions are aligned with malicious intent. The code's structure and obfuscation are straightforward, but the intent to silently execute remote content is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious behavior by collecting system info, exfiltrating it, and executing a remote payload during package installation. These actions constitute a security threat, likely designed for malicious control or system compromise.",
