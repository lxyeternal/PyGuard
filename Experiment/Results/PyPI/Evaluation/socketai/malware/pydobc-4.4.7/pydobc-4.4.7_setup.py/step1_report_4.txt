{
  "purpose": "The script is intended to install a Python package named 'pydobc' and executes additional actions post-installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URLs for downloading a file and sending a GET request.",
  "sinks": "Downloading and executing a file ('ini_file_pyp_32.exe') via os.system, sending data to an external server via requests.get.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent as a parameter to a remote URL, then a file is downloaded and executed locally, possibly based on platform detection.",
  "anomalies": "Uses broad exception handling that suppresses errors, downloads and runs an executable during installation, sending system info to an external URL, no verification of downloaded content, or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, defines a function 'send' that collects the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and reports it to a remote server. It then conditionally downloads and executes an executable file if on Windows platform, potentially enabling malicious activity such as installing unwanted software or backdoors. The installation class overrides the run method to invoke 'send' post-installation, making this activity part of the package installation process. The use of broad exception handling prevents detection and error reporting, which is suspicious. The code does not validate the downloaded file or check its integrity, and executing downloaded content poses significant security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious intent by collecting system information, downloading, and executing a remote file during installation without user consent or verification. This behavior indicates potential supply chain compromise or malware delivery. The overall security risk is high due to these activities.",
