{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that performs an installation process and includes a custom post-installation step.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URLs in the 'send' function, and requests.get calls for downloading files.",
  "sinks": "os.system call to execute downloaded executable, HTTP requests sending data to external server.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> HTTP GET request to external server with environment info -> downloading executable from external URL -> executing downloaded file via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of sending environment info to external server, downloading and executing an executable during installation, lack of error handling for these operations, and use of broad except clause.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that collects the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it via an HTTP request to a suspicious URL. It also downloads an executable from an external domain and runs it with 'os.system'. This behavior is triggered during the installation process through a custom 'PostInstallCommand'. Such actions could be malicious, as they involve data exfiltration and remote code execution during package installation. The code lacks safeguards, error handling, or any indication of legitimate purpose, and the URLs used are suspicious. The code demonstrates potentially malicious behavior by executing external code and transmitting system info without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system environment data, sending it to an external server, downloading, and executing an external executable during package installation. These actions are characteristic of supply chain malware or backdoor functionality, with high suspicion of malicious intent.",
