{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package and includes a post-installation step that performs network communication and potentially downloads and executes a file.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and URLs used in the 'send' function; the 'os.system' command to execute downloaded files.",
  "sinks": "The 'requests.get' calls to external URLs, and 'os.system' executing a downloaded executable file.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent as a parameter in an HTTP GET request. The response from a URL is downloaded and saved as an executable, then executed via 'os.system'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' to identify the host; downloading and executing an external executable during installation; no validation or sandboxing. The 'send' function runs unconditionally during installation, regardless of context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and requests, and defines a function 'send' that retrieves environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', sends it to an external URL, then downloads and executes a remote script if on Windows. The 'PostInstallCommand' class runs this 'send' function after installation. This behavior can be malicious, as it leaks environment info and runs external code without user consent. The 'try-except' block suppresses errors, avoiding detection, but does not mitigate malicious intent. The use of 'os.system' to execute downloaded content is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This package includes malicious behavior by exfiltrating system info and downloading/executing external code during installation, indicative of a supply chain security threat. It is highly suspicious and should be avoided.",
