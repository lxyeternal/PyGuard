{
  "purpose": "The code performs malicious activities during package installation, including exfiltrating system info, downloading, and executing external payloads without user consent.",
  "sources": "Retrieves 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; reads external URLs for download and execution.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to external server; executes downloaded executable via os.system.",
  "flows": "Source ('COMPUTERNAME') -> HTTP GET request; Downloaded file -> os.system execution.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling suppresses errors; execution of external code during install; use of suspicious URLs; no validation of downloaded files.",
  "analysis": "The code exfiltrates environment info to an external server and downloads a malicious executable during installation, executing it without validation. The broad exception handling masks errors, which is typical in malicious scripts. URLs used are suspicious, indicating malicious intent. The straightforward code and active remote code execution confirm malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains high-probability malicious code designed for data theft and remote code execution. The behavior is consistent with supply chain malware, warranting a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9. The code is not obfuscated. It should be flagged and removed from distribution.",
