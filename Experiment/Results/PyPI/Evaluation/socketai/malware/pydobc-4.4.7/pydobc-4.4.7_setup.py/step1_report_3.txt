{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with custom post-install behavior that attempts to send environment data and download a file.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URL in requests.get('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php'), URL in requests.get('https://python-release.com/python-install.scr')",
  "sinks": "os.system('start '+filename) which executes downloaded file",
  "flows": "send() reads environment variable and makes HTTP requests, then potentially executes downloaded file via os.system",
  "anomalies": "Code automatically retrieves environment info and downloads and executes an external executable during package installation, which is suspicious; using broad exception handling suppresses errors hiding malicious intent; the URLs used are suspicious and possibly malicious; the code executes external files without validation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send()' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a suspicious URL. It then downloads an executable from a second suspicious URL and executes it using 'os.system'. The 'PostInstallCommand' class triggers this 'send()' function during package installation. These behaviors suggest data exfiltration and execution of potentially malicious code, which are common in malicious supply chain attacks. The broad exception handling hides errors, making malicious actions less detectable. The code does not use any obfuscation or benign comments, and the URLs are indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs suspicious actions including environment data exfiltration and downloading/executing external files during package installation, which strongly suggests malicious behavior. It should be considered malicious and unsafe for use.",
