  "purpose": "A simple Python script defining and calling a function that prints 'installed'.",
  "sources": "The function ina() and the call to ina() itself; no external inputs or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output; no untrusted data or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Function ina() is invoked immediately after definition; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static function that prints a message. It does not process external data, perform network activity, or modify system state. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate.",
