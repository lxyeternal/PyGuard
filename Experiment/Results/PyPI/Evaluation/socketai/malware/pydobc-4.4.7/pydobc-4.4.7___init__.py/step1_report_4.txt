  "purpose": "The code defines and calls a function that prints a message indicating an installation status.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the print statement, which outputs a fixed message.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from source to sink; the function simply prints a static string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single function 'ina' that prints a static message. The function is immediately invoked after its definition. There are no inputs, external data sources, or complex behaviors. The simplicity suggests this is likely a basic status or debug message without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple print operation with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It presents no security risk.",
