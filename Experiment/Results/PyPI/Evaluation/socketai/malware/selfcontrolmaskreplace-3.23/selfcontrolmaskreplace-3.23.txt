      "conclusion": "The analyzed code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicative of malicious activity. The high obfuscation, stealth, and presence of a suspicious URL justify high malware and security risk scores. While the payload is not decoded, the pattern aligns with common malicious techniques, warranting treating this package as potentially malicious until further analysis confirms safety."
