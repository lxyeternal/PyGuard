{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system information, downloads, and executes a malicious payload during package installation, constituting a supply chain attack.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', network requests to suspicious URLs, file download and execution via os.system",
  "sinks": "Requests to external servers, execution of downloaded executable, system commands via os.system",
  "flows": "Environment variable read -> data sent via GET request -> executable downloaded -> executed with os.system during install",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling, execution during setup, use of suspicious URLs, downloading and executing external binary",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment info, exfiltrates it, downloads a binary from a suspicious domain, and executes it silently during installation. Error handling is suppressed, hiding failures. These behaviors are indicative of malicious activity, involving data theft and remote code execution, with no obfuscation present. The malicious actions are explicitly implemented and align with known supply chain attack patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious intent, including data exfiltration, remote code download, and execution during package installation. The activity poses a high security risk, justifying maximum malware and risk scores.",
