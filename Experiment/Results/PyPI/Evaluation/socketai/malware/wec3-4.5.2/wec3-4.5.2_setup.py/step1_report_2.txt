  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes post-installation actions.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', downloading and executing an executable from an external URL, making HTTP requests to external servers.",
  "sinks": "os.system('start '+filename) executes downloaded executable, requests.get calls to external URLs, potential data exfiltration via requests, execution of downloaded file.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> URL request to 'linkedopports.com' with env data -> download of executable from 'python-release.com' -> execution of downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual inclusion of download and execution of an external executable during installation, dynamic URL requests with environment data, no visible user consent or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a suspicious URL. It then downloads an executable from another suspicious domain and runs it silently. This behavior is initiated during the post-installation process of the package, which is unusual and indicates potential malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or configuration tasks. The use of broad exception handling ('except: pass') suppresses errors, hiding potential issues. The overall pattern suggests an attempt to install and run arbitrary code during package installation, which could be malicious malware or a supply chain attack.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential by exfiltrating environment information and executing external malware during package installation. This behavior is suspicious, unauthorized, and indicates malicious intent.",
