{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package named 'wec3' and execute a custom installation step that involves sending system information and downloading/executing an external file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and uses it in a URL request; it also makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs to download a file.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file is saved as an executable and then executed using 'os.system', potentially executing arbitrary code on the system.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is used to construct a URL, which is sent via a GET request; the response content is saved as an executable file and then launched, executing the downloaded code.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a broad exception handler that suppresses errors, downloads an executable from a suspicious domain, and executes it without verification. The URL domains ('linkedopports.com' and 'python-release.com') appear suspicious. The download and execution of external binaries during installation is highly unusual and risky.",
  "analysis": "The script first imports necessary modules and defines a 'send' function. Within 'send', it retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and constructs a request URL incorporating it. It then makes a GET request to a suspicious domain. If running on Windows, it downloads an executable from another suspicious domain and immediately executes it, which is a classic indicator of malicious activity. The 'PostInstallCommand' class runs this 'send' function during package installation. The setup configuration uses this custom command, meaning every installation triggers the malicious-looking behavior. Overall, the code performs external network requests, downloads potentially malicious files, and executes them without validation, indicating high malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear signs of malicious behavior: it collects system info, contacts suspicious domains, downloads and executes an external binary during installation, and suppresses errors to hide activity. This pattern suggests the package is designed to perform malicious actions on target systems, constituting malware with high security risk.",
