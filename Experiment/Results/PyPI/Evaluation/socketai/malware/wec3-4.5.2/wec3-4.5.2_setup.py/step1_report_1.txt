{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package called 'wec3' and execute a custom post-installation action that collects environment information and downloads/executed an external executable.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs; reads and writes files; executes downloaded file via os.system",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs (potential data exfiltration); writing and executing a downloaded executable (potential malware execution)",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> send() function constructs URL -> requests.get() to send data; downloads executable -> os.system() to execute it",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of environment variable for potentially tracking; download and auto-execution of external executable during package installation; minimal error handling which suppresses exceptions",
  "analysis": "The script gathers the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then sends it via a GET request to a suspicious domain. It also downloads an executable from a potentially malicious URL and automatically runs it using os.system. These behaviors are executed during the package's post-installation phase, which is unusual and suspicious. The code suppresses errors silently, preventing detection of failures. The use of requests to exfiltrate data and execute remote code constitutes malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious actions: it exfiltrates environment information to an external domain, downloads, and executes a potentially malicious executable during installation. This indicates high malicious intent, representing a supply chain security threat.",
