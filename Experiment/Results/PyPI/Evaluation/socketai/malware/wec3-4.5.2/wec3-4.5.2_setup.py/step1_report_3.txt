{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'wec3' and includes a custom installation command that performs additional actions after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and performs network requests to specific URLs during installation.",
  "sinks": "The code retrieves content from a URL and executes it via os.system, which can run arbitrary executable files downloaded from the internet.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is used to construct a URL, and if on Windows, a file is downloaded and executed, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The send() function is designed to collect system info and download and execute a potentially remote executable without user consent. The URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php' and 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' appear suspicious. The try-except block suppresses errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities and defines a function 'send()' that attempts to read the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable. It sends a GET request to a suspicious URL, then, if on Windows, downloads an executable from another suspicious URL and executes it via os.system. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it downloads and runs external binaries without user approval. The suppression of exceptions prevents detection of failures or errors, further masking malicious intent. The package setup includes this custom install command, meaning the malicious behavior triggers during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior intended to collect system info, download, and execute remote code during installation. This is a clear security threat, indicating malicious intent with potential for system compromise.",
