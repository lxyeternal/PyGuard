{
  "purpose": "A minimal Python script defining and invoking a function that prints 'installed'.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, environment variables, or data sources; static code with no data reading.",
  "sinks": "Print statement to standard output; no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Function call flow: ina() -> print('installed')",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious constructs, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward function definition and invocation, with no external data, no malicious behavior, and no obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious data flows, or security issues. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the code's trivial and transparent nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or further scrutiny are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
