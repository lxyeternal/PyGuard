  "purpose": "The code defines and calls a simple function that prints a message indicating installation.",
  "sources": "Function call 'ina()' that executes the print statement",
  "sinks": "The print statement which outputs to standard output",
  "flows": "Function invocation flows directly to print, which outputs the string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and minimal",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single function definition 'ina' that prints 'installed' when called. The function is invoked immediately after its definition. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no interaction with system resources beyond standard output. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated logic, or suspicious constructs. It appears to serve as a simple indicator of installation status or a placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to print a message and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
