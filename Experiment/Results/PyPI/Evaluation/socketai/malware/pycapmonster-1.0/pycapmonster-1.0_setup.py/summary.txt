  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing remote code fetched over the network during package setup, which constitutes a high-severity supply chain attack. The reported scores are appropriate, though the obfuscation scores should be lowered to reflect the code's transparency. It should be flagged and reviewed thoroughly before use or distribution."
