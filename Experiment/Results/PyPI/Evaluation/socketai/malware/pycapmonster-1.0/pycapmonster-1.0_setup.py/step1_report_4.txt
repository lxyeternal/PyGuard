  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pycapmonster' package, with an embedded payload that executes code from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from a temporary file (_ttmp), environment variables (_eexecutable), and system command (_ssystem).",
  "sinks": "Executing a system command to run a temporary file, executing code read from a remote URL, and writing to a temporary file.",
  "flows": "The temporary file contains code that fetches data from 'https://paste.bingner.com/paste/qgu3e/raw' and executes it; then the system runs a modified executable with this file as argument.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and executes external code dynamically without validation; use of temp files for executing remote code; attempt to start a process with a modified executable name.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup from setuptools for package installation. It creates a temporary file containing code that fetches and executes code from a remote URL, which is a common pattern for malicious code injection. It then attempts to run this temporary file via a system command, modifying the executable name slightly. The setup() call appears standard but is likely used to hide malicious activity during package installation. The remote code execution payload is suspicious and indicates malicious intent, as it dynamically fetches and executes code without validation.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior through remote code execution. It downloads code from an external source and executes it, which is highly suspicious. The overall risk is high, and the package should not be used.",
