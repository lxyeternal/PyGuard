  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pycapmonster' package, including an embedded malicious payload execution.",
  "sources": "Reading from imported modules, creating a temporary file, system command execution, fetching external URL content.",
  "sinks": "System command execution with '_ssystem', fetching remote code with 'urlopen' and executing it indirectly.",
  "flows": "Temporary file creation -> URL fetch -> code execution -> system call to run a temporary file.",
  "anomalies": "Creates a temporary file containing code that fetches and executes external code; uses try-except to suppress errors; executes a script from an external URL which could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for package setup but also constructs a temporary file that contains a URL request to an external site. This URL content is then executed dynamically, indicating remote code execution. The code then attempts to run this file via a system command, which could lead to arbitrary code execution on the host. The setup() call appears normal but is likely used as a decoy or alongside malicious behavior. The use of 'start' and '_eexecutable' suggests attempting to run the malicious code with the same Python interpreter, increasing risk. Overall, this pattern indicates malicious intent to execute external code without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior by fetching and executing external code and running a temporary script, representing a high security risk. It is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
