The reported scores are appropriate, though the obfuscation scores should be lowered to reflect the code's transparency. It should be flagged and reviewed thoroughly before use or distribution."

The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the behavior. It should be classified as malicious with maximum concern, and appropriate mitigation actions should be taken."
