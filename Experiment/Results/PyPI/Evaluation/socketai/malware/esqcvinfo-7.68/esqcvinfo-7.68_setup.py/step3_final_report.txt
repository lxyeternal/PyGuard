{
  "purpose": "Detects and evaluates malicious behavior in the setup script, specifically the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command when the 'tahg' directory is absent.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command; comment containing suspicious URL.",
  "sinks": "Execution of hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command; potential remote code execution or payload download during setup.",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' directory -> if absent, execute encoded PowerShell command via subprocess -> command runs with hidden window, potentially downloading or executing malicious payload.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently; broad exception handling suppresses errors; presence of suspicious URL in comment.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory; if missing, runs a hidden, base64-encoded PowerShell command, which is obfuscated and suspicious. The command's purpose is unclear but likely malicious, especially given the URL and obfuscation. The broad try-except blocks hide errors, potentially concealing malicious activity. The setup function appears legitimate but is compromised by this embedded payload. Scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.8-0.85, obfuscated ~0.9, security risk ~0.85-0.9) are justified given the evidence. Without decoding the command, certainty is limited, but suspicion is high. The behavior aligns with common malware tactics such as remote code execution, backdoors, or payload delivery during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains highly suspicious, potentially malicious behavior involving obfuscated PowerShell execution during setup. The high scores are justified; further decoding of the command is recommended. Treat this package as malicious until confirmed safe.",
