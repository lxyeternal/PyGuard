      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell command triggered conditionally, indicative of malicious activity. The high scores in malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified by the observed behavior. It is recommended to treat this package as malicious until the payload can be decoded and verified."
