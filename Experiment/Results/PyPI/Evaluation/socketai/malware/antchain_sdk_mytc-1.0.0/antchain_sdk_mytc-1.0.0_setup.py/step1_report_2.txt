{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation process.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from socket (hostname), current working directory, and user environment (getpass).",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io) during installation.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, cwd, username) flows into the requests.get call, which sends data to an external server during install.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during the installation process, which is unusual and suspicious for a package setup script. The URL used for exfiltration appears to be a Ceye.io domain, often used for DNS or HTTP-based C2 or exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the standard setuptools installation process by overriding the run method. After executing the normal install process, it gathers system information—hostname, current working directory, and username—and sends this data to an external server via a GET request. This behavior indicates data exfiltration, which is malicious in the context of package installation. No other suspicious or malicious code, such as backdoors or data theft from sensitive environments, is evident. The URL used suggests an intent to capture environment data covertly during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it exfiltrates system information during package installation, which can be used for reconnaissance or tracking. This behavior indicates a supply chain attack vector. The package's primary purpose appears legitimate, but the side effect of data exfiltration makes it malicious.",
