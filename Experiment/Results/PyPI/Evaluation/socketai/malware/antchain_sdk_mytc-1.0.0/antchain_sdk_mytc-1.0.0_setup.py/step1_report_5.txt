  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation step to gather system information and send it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call transmits data to an external server, potentially leaking system info.",
  "flows": "The source data (hostname, cwd, username) is collected and sent via HTTP GET request during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects system information and exfiltrates it to an external URL without user consent, which is suspicious. Use of custom install class to perform network activity at install time is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom setup command that, during package installation, collects hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data to a specified external URL. This behavior indicates data exfiltration. The URL is hardcoded, and the request is made without user awareness. No other malicious code or backdoors are present, but the data collection and exfiltration pattern are concerning. The use of setup.py for such activity is suspicious, as this file is normally for package metadata, not network communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system info during installation, which constitutes a supply chain security risk. It likely aims to gather system info surreptitiously. Overall, the script should be considered malicious or at least highly suspicious.",
