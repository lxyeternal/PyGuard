{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrates it to an external server, indicating malicious data theft behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the system environment: hostname (socket.gethostname()), current directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "The data is sent via an HTTP GET request to 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' using requests.get(), which transmits the collected info externally.",
  "flows": "The sources (system info) flow directly into the requests.get() call as URL parameters, resulting in data exfiltration during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration without user consent, during package setup, to a suspicious external URL. The URL domain 'ceye.io' is associated with security testing and exfiltration activities. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the behavior is highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the standard setup.py install command to include a step that gathers system info and sends it externally. This exfiltration occurs silently during package installation, which is abnormal and indicates malicious intent. The URL used is known for security testing and exfiltration, further supporting malicious behavior. The code is clear and not obfuscated, but the activity it performs is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack tactics, aiming to collect environment data covertly. The scores assigned in the reports vary, but given the clear exfiltration, a high malware score (~0.9) and high security risk (~0.9) are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious exfiltration of system information during package installation, constituting a high security threat and malware potential. The behavior is clearly suspicious, and the scores should reflect high malicious intent and risk. The activity should be flagged as malicious, with malware score around 0.9 and security risk near 0.9, and obfuscation score at 0 due to code clarity.",
