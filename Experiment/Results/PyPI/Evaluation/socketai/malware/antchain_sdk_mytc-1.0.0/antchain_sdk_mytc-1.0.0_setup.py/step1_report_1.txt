  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration that includes a custom installation step which collects system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with external URL containing system information as parameters",
  "flows": "Collects hostname, current working directory, username -> sends data via HTTP GET request to external server",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of code that silently exfiltrates system information during installation without user consent; usage of external URL for data collection; no validation or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon execution, gathers hostname, current directory, and username. It then makes a GET request to an external server with this data. This behavior indicates data exfiltration during package installation, which is suspicious. The code does not perform any other malicious actions such as executing malicious code or damaging files. The URL used for data collection appears malicious and is external. No obfuscation or malicious obfuscation techniques are present; the code is straightforward but suspicious due to its behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script secretly collects and transmits system information to an external server during package installation, which is a malicious privacy violation and potential security threat. This behavior indicates malicious intent, likely to track or identify users without their knowledge.",
