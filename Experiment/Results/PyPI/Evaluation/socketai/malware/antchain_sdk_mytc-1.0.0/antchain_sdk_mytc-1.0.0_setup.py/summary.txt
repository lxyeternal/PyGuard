  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious exfiltration of system information during package installation, constituting a high security threat and malware potential. The behavior is clearly suspicious, and the scores should reflect high malicious intent and risk. The activity should be flagged as malicious, with malware score around 0.9 and security risk near 0.9, and obfuscation score at 0 due to code clarity."
