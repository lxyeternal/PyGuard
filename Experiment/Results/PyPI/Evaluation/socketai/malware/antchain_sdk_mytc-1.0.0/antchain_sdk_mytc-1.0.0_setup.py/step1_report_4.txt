{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation step that reports system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username using socket, os, and getpass modules.",
  "sinks": "The external HTTP GET request to 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' transmits collected system information, acting as a data exfiltration point.",
  "flows": "Data from system information sources (hostname, cwd, username) flows into the requests.get() call, which sends it to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class collects and transmits system data during package installation without user consent. The URL used is suspicious and indicates potential malicious activity. The code involves network activity in a setup script, which is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py defines a custom installation class that extends the standard install process. During installation, it gathers system info: hostname, current directory, and username. Immediately after, it makes an HTTP GET request to an external server with these details as parameters. This behavior suggests data exfiltration of environment info during package install. The URL appears to be a dynamic or controlled domain, indicating possible malicious intent to collect user environment data without disclosure. The code's placement in setup.py, a common package configuration file, and the network activity performed at install time, are suspicious and characteristic of malicious supply chain behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs normal package setup tasks but includes suspicious behavior: exfiltration of environment data to an external server during installation. This indicates malicious intent, likely for tracking or data theft purposes, representing a security risk.",
