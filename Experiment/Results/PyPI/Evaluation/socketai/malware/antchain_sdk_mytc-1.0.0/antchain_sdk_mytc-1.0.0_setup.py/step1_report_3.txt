{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "The untrusted data (hostname, cwd, username) is sent via HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io).",
  "flows": "During installation, environment data is gathered and transmitted over the network to an external server, potentially leaking system information.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during the install process without any explicit user consent or obvious legitimate reason. The URL used for data collection appears to be a Ceye.io domain, often used for DNS and HTTP data collection in security research, indicating potential malicious intent or malicious-sounding behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the standard setuptools installation process by overriding the run method. It collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data to an external server via a GET request. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking, which is unusual for a package setup script and not typical or justified. There are no other malicious actions like code execution, data theft, or backdoors. The presence of a network request during installation without user consent raises security concerns about privacy violation and possible malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation, which could be used for malicious tracking or reconnaissance. While it doesn't perform destructive actions, this network activity is indicative of potential privacy violations and malicious behavior in the context of supply chain security.",
