  "purpose": "A simple function that prints 'installed' and is invoked immediately.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data flows, or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only prints a static message.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function call is straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'ina()' that prints a static message 'installed' and calls it immediately. It contains no external dependencies, no data input, no network or file operations, and no obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, straightforward, and poses no security risk. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications or further scrutiny are necessary.",
