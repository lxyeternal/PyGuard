  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static message is printed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded string, straightforward function",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'ina' that prints a static string 'installed'. The function is invoked immediately after definition. No external inputs, no data processing, no security-sensitive operations, and no suspicious patterns are present. The code appears benign, intended solely for logging or simple status output.",
  "conclusion": "This is a trivial, benign script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply outputs a static message, likely for informational purposes.",
