{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system information, downloads and executes a suspicious executable during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Retrieves 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; reads from os.environ; makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs; writing and executing downloaded executable via os.system; data exfiltration via HTTP GET.",
  "flows": "Source ('COMPUTERNAME') -> send() function: sends data via GET request; on Windows, downloads executable -> executes it with os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Broad try-except block with silent pass; downloading and executing an external executable during package install; suspicious URLs; no validation or error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves system info, exfiltrates it to a remote server, then downloads and runs an executable from a suspicious URL during installation. The silent exception handling conceals errors, typical of malicious scripts. The URLs are unrelated to legitimate package sources, indicating malicious activity. The code's straightforward structure confirms malicious intent rather than obfuscation. Given the behavior—remote code execution, data exfiltration, silent failures—the code exhibits high malicious potential. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~1, security risk ~1, obfuscated 0) are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious activity involving data exfiltration and remote code execution during package installation. The high malware and security risk scores are appropriate. The package should be flagged as malicious and avoided.",
