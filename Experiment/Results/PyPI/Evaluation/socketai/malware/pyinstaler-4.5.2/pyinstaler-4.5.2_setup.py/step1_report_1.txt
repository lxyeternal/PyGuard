{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with a custom installation command that executes additional code during installation.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', the URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', and the URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' used for downloading and executing a file.",
  "sinks": "The open() function writing to 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe' and the os.system() call executing the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is included in a GET request; if on Windows, a file is downloaded from a suspicious URL and executed, potentially running malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from a suspicious domain and automatically runs it during package installation. The use of try-except with a silent pass indicates obfuscation or an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php' and 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate package distribution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, then defines a 'send' function that collects the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a remote server. It then downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it silently on Windows platforms. The custom 'PostInstallCommand' class triggers 'send()' during installation. The setup configuration specifies package details but includes no legitimate dependencies. The pattern of downloading and executing external binaries during install is characteristic of malicious supply chain behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly downloading and executing a potentially harmful executable during package installation. It also exfiltrates system information (COMPUTERNAME) to a remote server, indicating privacy violation and potential backdoor activity. The overall security risk is high, and the package should not be used.",
