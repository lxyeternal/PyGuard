{
  "purpose": "To perform setup and installation of a Python package while executing a custom post-installation step.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URLs used in requests.get calls",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, writing and executing a downloaded file with os.system",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> Sends data to linkedopports.com -> Downloads and executes an executable from python-release.com",
  "anomalies": "Uses try-except block without handling exceptions, dynamically downloads and executes an external file, constructs a URL with environment data, no valid security considerations in code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a suspicious URL. It then downloads an executable from another suspicious URL and runs it via os.system. The setup configuration includes a custom install command that triggers 'send' post-install. The use of external network requests, dynamic execution of downloaded files, and collection of environment info suggest malicious intent or at least malicious potential. The code does not validate or sanitize inputs and operates silently within a try-except block, which suppresses errors, further hiding malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be malicious, performing data exfiltration and executing potentially harmful files from untrusted sources. It is highly suspicious due to external network communications, data collection, and execution of downloaded content. This package should be considered dangerous for use.",
