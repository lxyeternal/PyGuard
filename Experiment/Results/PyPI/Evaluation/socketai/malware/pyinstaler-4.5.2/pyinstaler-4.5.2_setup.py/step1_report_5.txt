{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with additional code to execute during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', downloads a file from a suspicious URL, and executes it; also makes an HTTP request with environment info.",
  "sinks": "Executes downloaded file with 'os.system', sending environment info over HTTP, and making network requests.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> HTTP request to linkedopports.com and python-release.com -> Downloads and executes a file from python-release.com.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions; downloads and runs an executable during package install; sends system info to an external server; the download URL and request URL are suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the setup process by adding a custom install command that calls 'send()'. The 'send()' function retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a remote URL. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it immediately. The code's behavior suggests intentional data exfiltration and remote code execution during package installation, which are typical malicious actions. The use of broad exception handling and lack of verification of downloaded content increase the risk. These activities are highly suspicious and align with malicious intent, such as installing backdoors or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system info, downloading and executing potentially malicious files during package installation, indicating a supply chain attack or backdoor. The overall security risk is high.",
