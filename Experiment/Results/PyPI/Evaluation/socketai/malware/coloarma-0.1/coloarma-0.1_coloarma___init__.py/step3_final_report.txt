  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns such as eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, and suspicious network activity.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, user inputs, external files, network connections, and system calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve eval/exec functions, network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, and system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks like eval/exec or network sockets, especially if untrusted data is involved.",
  "anomalies": "Potential anomalies include use of eval/exec on untrusted data, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow patterns. No explicit anomalies detected in provided code snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code review indicates that most reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, with scores reflecting low malware risk (0) and no obfuscation (0). Report 1 suggests potential dynamic code execution risks, with a moderate security risk score (0.45) and confidence (0.7), justified if eval/exec are used unsafely. Other reports show standard, benign code with high confidence and low risk scores. No evidence of obfuscation or malware is found across all reports. The risk score for Report 1 is slightly elevated due to potential unsafe eval/exec usage, but without concrete evidence, the score remains appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the dependency appears benign with no confirmed malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with a slight concern in Report 1 due to potential dynamic code execution risks. No further adjustments are necessary; the security posture is low, and the risk is moderate but justified.",
