  "conclusion": "Overall, the dependency appears benign with no confirmed malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with a slight concern in Report 1 due to potential dynamic code execution risks. No further adjustments are necessary; the security posture is low, and the risk is moderate but justified."
