      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated with complex, meaningless calculations and conditional logic that obscure its true intent. It attempts to perform system modifications, file operations, and module imports that could be malicious. The presence of system-level modules and file manipulations suggests a high security risk, potentially malicious behavior, and sabotage. The malware score should be set to 1 due to the potential for harmful actions."
