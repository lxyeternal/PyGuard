{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and runs custom installation steps, including decryption and execution of code.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports modules, and decrypts and executes encrypted code during installation.",
  "sinks": "exec() with decrypted code, importing potentially suspicious modules (requests, fernet), executing encrypted payload.",
  "flows": "During installation, environment check -> import modules -> decrypt and execute code; external dependencies requested during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload executed via exec(), importing requests and fernet within installation, presence of seemingly random strings in description fields.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup file with standard packaging code, but it includes a class that overrides the run method to perform an environment check. If running on Windows, it imports requests and fernet, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string and executes the resulting code via exec(). This is highly suspicious, as it decrypts and runs code at install time, potentially enabling malicious behavior such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of encrypted code, combined with executing arbitrary code during setup, indicates malicious intent. The rest of the script appears typical for setup configurations, but the presence of these malicious elements elevates the risk significantly.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains encrypted payload execution during installation, which is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent. This could enable remote code execution or backdoor installation, representing a severe security risk.",
