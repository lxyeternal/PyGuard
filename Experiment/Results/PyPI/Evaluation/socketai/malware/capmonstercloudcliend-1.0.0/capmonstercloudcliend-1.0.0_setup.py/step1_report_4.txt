  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and runs custom installation logic, including decryption and execution of code.",
  "sources": "Imports (os, requests, fernet), Fernet decryption key and ciphertext, exec() call with decrypted code.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, requests module imported but not used directly in the visible code.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Fernet decryption -> exec() executes decrypted code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with decrypted code from Fernet, hardcoded encryption key and ciphertext, conditional import and execution based on OS, obfuscated or non-transparent long description.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and third-party modules, defines package metadata, and custom installation logic. The custom install class runs a decryption of encrypted code with a hardcoded key and executes it via exec(), which is suspicious as it may execute malicious payloads. The code decrypts data and runs it unconditionally on Windows OS, potentially executing malicious code embedded within the encrypted payload. The long description appears obfuscated or nonsensical, suggesting an attempt to hide the true purpose. The presence of 'requests' and 'fernet' modules hints at potential network activity or secret handling, but no network calls are explicitly made in this snippet. The usage of exec() with decrypted data is a high-risk behavior, indicating possible malware or backdoor functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior due to the use of encrypted payload and exec() execution, which is a common technique to hide malicious actions. It is highly suspicious and indicates potential malware activity, specifically a hidden backdoor or remote code execution. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
