{
  "purpose": "Detect malicious or suspicious behavior in the setup script, specifically the decryption and execution of embedded payloads during installation.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded ciphertext and Fernet key, import of requests and Fernet modules, execution of decrypted code via exec() during run() method.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted payload, potential for arbitrary code execution, especially on Windows systems.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code imports modules, decrypts hardcoded ciphertext with a hardcoded key, then executes the decrypted code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payloads with hardcoded cryptographic secrets, conditional execution only on Windows, execution of dynamically decrypted code during setup, obfuscated strings and descriptions.",
  "analysis": "The code decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and executes it via exec() during installation on Windows systems. The presence of encrypted payloads, hardcoded cryptographic secrets, and runtime code execution are classic indicators of malicious intent. The code's obfuscation through nonsensical strings and encrypted data further supports suspicion. The pattern suggests potential backdoors, remote code execution, or malicious payload delivery. The suspicious pattern is consistent across reports, with high confidence in maliciousness. The use of exec() on decrypted data during setup poses a severe security risk, and the package's design appears intentionally obfuscated to hide malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-probability malicious behavior by decrypting and executing arbitrary code during installation, especially on Windows. The embedded cryptographic secrets and obfuscation indicate malicious intent. The package should be considered unsafe and flagged for further investigation or removal.",
