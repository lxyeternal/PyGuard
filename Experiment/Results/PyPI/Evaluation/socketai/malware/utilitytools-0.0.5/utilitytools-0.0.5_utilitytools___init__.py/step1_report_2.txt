{
  "purpose": "The code imports a main function from the utilitytools.run module, likely to execute some main process or script.",
  "sources": "Import statement from utilitytools.run",
  "sinks": "Execution of imported main function (potentially executing untrusted or external code)",
  "flows": "Import from utilitytools.run -> execution of main()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in the import statement itself; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports the main function from utilitytools.run without executing it or including any other logic. Since no execution of main() is shown, there are no immediate signs of malicious behavior. The import is standard; no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The security concern would only arise if main() is executed elsewhere, which is not shown here.",
  "conclusion": "This minimal code snippet is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It merely imports a function and does not perform any actions that could be harmful.",
