  "purpose": "The code imports the 'main' function from the 'utilitytools.run' module, likely intended to execute or initiate some process when called.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'utilitytools.run', which may load code or functions from an external module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or output is shown.",
  "flows": "No executable flow is demonstrated; the code only contains an import statement without invocation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden behavior. The import path suggests reliance on an external module, but nothing suspicious is evident in this line alone.",
  "analysis": "This snippet is a simple import statement. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or system modification. Without additional context or usage, it is unlikely to be malicious. The import could be benign, used to execute code elsewhere, but based solely on this snippet, there is no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign in isolation; it merely imports a function from a module. There are no signs of malware or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
