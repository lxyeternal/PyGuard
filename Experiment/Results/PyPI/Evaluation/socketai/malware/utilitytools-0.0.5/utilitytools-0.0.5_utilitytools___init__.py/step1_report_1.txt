  "purpose": "Import and potentially execute the main function from utilitytools.run",

  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in the provided code",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only import statement; no execution or data movement observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement without additional logic",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a function called main from the utilitytools.run module. There is no invocation or execution of this function in the snippet provided. The import itself is standard Python behavior and does not pose any security concerns unless the module itself contains malicious code, which cannot be determined from this fragment alone. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks evident in the provided code snippet. The overall security risk is minimal, but the risk assessment depends on the trustworthiness of the utilitytools.run module.",
