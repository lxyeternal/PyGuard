  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Setup script with custom commands executing additional code during install.\n- **Key point:** Decodes a base64 string and runs it via `os.system`. The decoded command runs PowerShell with obfuscated code.\n- **Malicious indicators:** Obfuscation via base64, execution during install, PowerShell invocation, potential to run arbitrary code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.75, Obfuscated 1, Risk 0.75, Confidence 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies obfuscation and potential malicious intent. The decoded command's nature (PowerShell with obfuscated code) is suspicious. The high obfuscation score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar setup script with code executing during install.\n- **Key point:** Base64-decoded command involves PowerShell, likely downloading/executing external code.\n- **Malicious indicators:** Obfuscation, execution during install, PowerShell invocation, potential remote code execution.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.9, Obfuscated 0.8, Risk 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The high malware score is justified given the potential for remote code execution. The report emphasizes the malicious nature, which aligns with the decoded command's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Setup script with hidden malicious payload.\n- **Key point:** Decodes and executes a PowerShell command that appears to download/execute malicious scripts.\n- **Malicious indicators:** Obfuscation, execution during install, remote code fetch.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.8, Obfuscated 0.8, Risk 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly flags the malicious activity. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Setup script executing remote script via decoded PowerShell command.\n- **Key point:** The decoded command fetches and executes remote content, a major security concern.\n- **Malicious indicators:** Remote script download, obfuscation, execution during install.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.9, Obfuscated 0.8, Risk 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The high malware score is justified due to remote code execution, which is very dangerous.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar setup with hidden malicious behavior.\n- **Key point:** Decodes and runs a potentially dangerous PowerShell command during install.\n- **Malicious indicators:** Obfuscation, remote code execution potential, execution during install.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.8, Obfuscated 0.8, Risk 0.85.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the other reports; the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Behavior:** All reports agree that the core issue is the execution of obfuscated, potentially malicious PowerShell commands during package installation.\n- **Code Presence:** The code indeed contains the `notmalfunc()` function, decoding a base64 string and executing it via `os.system`. The decoded string is consistently a PowerShell command, often with parameters like `-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`, which are typical in malicious scripts to evade detection.\n- **Obfuscation:** The use of base64 encoding to hide the actual command is a common tactic to bypass static analysis.\n- **Malware Score Justification:** Given the ability to run arbitrary commands, download remote scripts, or execute malicious code, the malware scores of 0.75-0.9 are justified.\n- **Security Risk:** The potential for remote code execution, system compromise, or data exfiltration makes this behavior highly risky.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The high obfuscation scores are justified due to base64 encoding.\n- The malware scores are appropriately high, reflecting the malicious potential.\n- The overall behavior indicates malicious intent, especially since code runs during install, which could compromise user systems.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary:**\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** **0.85** (average of all reports, considering the high potential for remote code execution)  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** **0.8** (consistent across reports, justified by base64 encoding)  \n**Estimated Security Risk Score:** **0.85** (due to remote code execution, obfuscation, and execution during install)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code exhibits highly suspicious and potentially malicious behavior. It should be flagged as dangerous, and further static or dynamic analysis is recommended before deploying or distributing this package.",
