  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'utilitytools' that includes custom install and develop commands.",
  "sources": "Base64 encoded string within the notmalfunc() function, which decodes to a command string.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded base64 string, potentially running arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Base64 string decoded by b64d() -> executed via os.system in notmalfunc() during installation process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded string to hide code execution; the string decodes to a shell command that invokes a potentially dangerous process.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, defines a function b64d() that decodes base64 strings, and a function notmalfunc() that executes a decoded command. This command appears to be 'powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command \"Invoke-Expression ...\"' with an obfuscated or malicious intent. The custom install class AfterInstall runs notmalfunc() during installation, meaning this potentially executes arbitrary code at install time. The code uses base64 to conceal the command, which is suspicious. The command string itself is decoded from base64, indicating an attempt to hide malicious activity. No other suspicious or malicious patterns are found outside this base64-encoded command.",
  "conclusion": "The script includes a hidden malicious behavior: executing a base64-encoded command during installation, which could lead to remote code execution or other malicious actions. The use of base64 to hide the command strongly indicates malicious intent, possibly to install backdoors, exfiltrate data, or run harmful scripts without user awareness.",
