{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'utilitytools', with additional functionality to execute embedded code during installation or development.",
  "sources": "The code reads static source code and executes a base64-decoded command in the notmalfunc() function, which is invoked during installation.",
  "sinks": "The base64-decoded command is executed via os.system, which can run arbitrary code, leading to potential malicious actions such as remote code execution or system compromise.",
  "flows": "The script decodes the base64 string and executes it with os.system during package installation (run in AfterInstall), creating a source-to-sink flow from static encoded data to system command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to hide the true command, which involves a call to 'powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass ...' (decoded command), suggests obfuscation. The command appears to invoke PowerShell to download and possibly execute remote code. This is suspicious and atypical for a benign setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up package metadata and dependencies, which is standard. However, it contains a function 'notmalfunc' that decodes a base64 string and executes it with os.system. The base64 string decodes to a PowerShell command that likely downloads and executes external code. This behavior indicates malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, remote access tools, or executing arbitrary commands. The obfuscation through base64 encoding is a common tactic to hide malicious payloads. The execution occurs during installation, which is dangerous, especially since the command is not visible in the code but hidden inside an encoded string.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload encoded in base64, executed during package installation, which could perform malicious activities like remote code execution. The use of obfuscation and execution during install strongly indicates malicious intent. This package is potentially dangerous and should be considered unsafe for use.",
