{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'utilitytools' intended for distributing utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own file to define the setup configuration. It also imports environment variables and external modules such as 'requests'.",
  "sinks": "The code executes a function 'notmalfunc' during installation, which runs a base64-decoded command via os.system.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the 'notmalfunc' function is triggered, decoding and executing a command that appears to invoke a shell command with potential for malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'notmalfunc' decodes a base64 string that, when executed, runs 'powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command ...'. The decoded command appears to invoke PowerShell with an obfuscated or malicious intent, possibly downloading or executing external code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup script with a typical package configuration. However, it contains a hidden function 'notmalfunc' that is invoked during installation. This function decodes a base64-encoded PowerShell command and executes it using os.system. The command string is base64-encoded, making it obfuscated. The decoded command appears to run PowerShell with parameters that could be used to download or execute malicious scripts, possibly representing a backdoor or malicious payload. The presence of this behavior is suspicious because it executes code from a string embedded within the package, which is not typical for legitimate setup scripts. No other obvious malicious behavior or malicious library usage is present elsewhere in the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload executed during package installation, encoded in base64 and invoked via os.system. This behavior indicates malicious intent, potentially allowing remote code execution or data exfiltration upon package installation. The rest of the code appears benign and standard for a setup script. The obfuscation and execution of external commands in the install process is highly suspicious.",
