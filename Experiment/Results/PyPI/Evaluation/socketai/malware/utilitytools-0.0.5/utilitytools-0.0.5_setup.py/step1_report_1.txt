{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'utilitytools', including custom install and develop commands that execute additional code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings (base64-encoded command) and the 'requests' package dependency.",
  "sinks": "The base64-decoded command executes 'os.system' with decoded code, which could potentially run arbitrary shell commands.",
  "flows": "The 'notmalfunc' function decodes a base64 string and executes it via 'os.system', which is called during package installation via the 'AfterInstall' class.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded command executed during installation; no explicit hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors, but the decoded command could be malicious or harmful. The base64 string appears obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and other modules, defines a function 'b64d' to decode base64 strings, and a function 'notmalfunc' that decodes and executes a base64-encoded shell command. The command executed by 'notmalfunc' is: 'powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command \"[obfuscated code]\"'. This indicates that during installation, the script runs a PowerShell command which is obfuscated, and could potentially perform malicious actions. The command is stored as a base64 string, decoded, and executed via 'os.system'. The rest of the setup is standard for Python packages. Since the decoded command could be malicious or harmful, this behavior is suspicious. The use of base64 to hide the command suggests an intent to conceal malicious activity or bypass static analysis.\n\nOverall, the code shows potentially malicious behavior during installation via obfuscated code execution, with no clear benign purpose for the encoded command.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated and potentially malicious behavior executed during package installation, specifically running a PowerShell command decoded from base64. This behavior is suspicious and could pose a security risk, warranting caution before use.",
