{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to execute a base64-encoded PowerShell command during package installation, likely for malicious purposes such as remote code execution or downloading malicious scripts.",
  "sources": "The function notmalfunc() decodes a base64 string and executes it via os.system during the install process.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decoded PowerShell command via os.system during setup, which can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "The code reads the base64 string, decodes it in notmalfunc(), and then executes the resulting PowerShell command during the install phase.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate a PowerShell command, execution during package installation, absence of benign purpose, and potential remote script fetching.",
  "analysis": "The script contains a function that decodes an obfuscated PowerShell command and executes it during setup, which is suspicious. The obfuscation via base64 and execution during install are common tactics in malicious packages. The decoded command likely involves remote code execution or downloading malicious scripts. The high scores for malware (0.85), obfuscation (0.8), and security risk (0.9) are justified based on these behaviors. The code’s intent appears malicious, and it poses a significant security threat if used.",
  "conclusion": "The package exhibits highly suspicious behavior with a high likelihood of malicious intent, executing obfuscated remote PowerShell commands during installation. It should be flagged as malicious and avoided unless thoroughly audited and verified as safe.",
