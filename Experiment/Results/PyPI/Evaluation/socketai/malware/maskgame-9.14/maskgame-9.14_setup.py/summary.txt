  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during setup, indicating a significant security threat. The high obfuscation and stealth tactics justify high malware and risk scores. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent, but current evidence strongly suggests malicious activity."
