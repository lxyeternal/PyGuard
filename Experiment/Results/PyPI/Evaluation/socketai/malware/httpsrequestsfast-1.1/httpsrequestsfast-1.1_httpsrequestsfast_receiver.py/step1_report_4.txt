  "flows": "Input source: External API URL -> requests.get -> returns IP address as text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code performs a straightforward external API call. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class Receiver with a method _get_ip that makes an HTTP request to retrieve the machine's public IP address. The operation is a standard external API call with no user input or data manipulation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. The code is simple and intended for network information retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, performing a common task of fetching the external IP address. No malicious intent or suspicious activity detected.",
