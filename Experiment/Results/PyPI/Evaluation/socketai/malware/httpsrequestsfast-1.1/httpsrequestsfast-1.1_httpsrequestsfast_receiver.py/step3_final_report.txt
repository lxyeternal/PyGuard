  "purpose": "Retrieve the system's public IP address via an external API call.",
  "sources": "The requests.get('https://api.ipify.org/') call within the _get_ip() method.",
  "sinks": "The external API endpoint; no data leaks or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Source: requests.get() response; sink: return statement providing the IP string.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward external API call with no obfuscation, credentials, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a method that performs a simple GET request to a well-known IP service and returns the response. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The network request is standard and does not involve data exfiltration or suspicious behavior. The minimal security risk score (0.1) in some reports likely overstates the risk, as the code is benign and uses a reputable API. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero. Confidence in benign assessment is high (near 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a common utility function without malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security risk score can be lowered to 0, as the external API call does not constitute a security concern in this context.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
