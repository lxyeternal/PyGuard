  "purpose": "The code defines a Receiver class with a method to retrieve the public IP address of the system by querying an external API.",
  "sources": "requests.get(\"https://api.ipify.org/\")",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call, which could potentially be used to send data over the network, but in this case, it only retrieves data.",
  "flows": "The method _get_ip() fetches data from an external source and returns the response text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code performs a simple network request without any suspicious parameters or obfuscated logic. No data leakage or insecure practices are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the requests library and defines a class with a single method that retrieves the system's public IP address from an external API. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any data exfiltration, hidden network communications, or other malicious actions. The code appears to be legitimate utility code for IP retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple external API call to retrieve the public IP address. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this snippet.",
