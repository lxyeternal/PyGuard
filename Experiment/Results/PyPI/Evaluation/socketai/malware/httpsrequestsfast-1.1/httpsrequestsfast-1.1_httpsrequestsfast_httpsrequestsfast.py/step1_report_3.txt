{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect Discord tokens and user data from various browser and application storage locations, verify their validity, retrieve associated user information, and send this data along with system info to a specified webhook.",
  "sources": "File system paths (local storage leveldb files), environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA), network requests to Discord API and webhook URL",
  "sinks": "Requests to Discord API with potentially valid tokens, POST request to external webhook URL, reading potentially sensitive files from disk",
  "flows": "Extraction of tokens from local files -> verification via Discord API -> retrieval of user data -> aggregation of data -> sending to external webhook",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded webhook URL, reading tokens from application local storage, no user consent prompts, possible collection of tokens and user info without user knowledge, obfuscated webhook string, no error handling for network requests beyond try-except, reliance on environment variables without validation",
  "analysis": "The code searches local application data directories for files with token patterns, extracts potential Discord tokens, and verifies their validity by making API requests. Valid tokens are used to fetch user data, which is then compiled into a message. The message includes system info obtained via another request. All this data is sent via a POST request to a hardcoded webhook URL. The code does not contain obfuscation, but the webhook URL is base64 encoded, which is a mild attempt to hide intent. The script operates stealthily, harvesting tokens and personal data, and exfiltrates it without user consent. Overall, it exhibits behaviors consistent with data theft, unauthorized access, and exfiltration, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is malicious; it harvests Discord tokens and user data from local storage, verifies tokens, gathers user info, and exfiltrates this sensitive data to an external webhook. Its behavior is consistent with credential theft and data exfiltration, classifying it as malware with high security risk.",
