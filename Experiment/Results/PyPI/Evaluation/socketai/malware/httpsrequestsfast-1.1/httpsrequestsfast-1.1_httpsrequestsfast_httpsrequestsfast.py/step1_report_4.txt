{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect Discord tokens from local storage files, validate them, retrieve associated user data, and send this information along with system details to a specified webhook. Its primary purpose seems to be token theft and data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads local storage files of various browsers and Discord-related directories to extract potential tokens; also reads environment variables for paths.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to a specified webhook URL; makes HTTP GET requests to Discord API with extracted tokens to validate and retrieve user info.",
  "flows": "Reads local storage files for tokens -> Validates tokens via HTTP requests -> Retrieves user info with tokens -> Exfiltrates collected data to webhook",
  "anomalies": "Uses obfuscated webhook URL (base64-encoded string), attempts to collect tokens stealthily from multiple browser directories, and sends user info and IP data without user consent. The use of environment variables for paths and the silent HTTP requests are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to harvest Discord tokens from user directories by scanning specific paths. It replaces placeholders with environment variables, which indicates an attempt to adapt to different systems. Tokens are validated through Discord API calls. Valid tokens are used to fetch user data, including email and phone number, and check for billing info. All collected data is compiled and sent via a POST request to an obfuscated webhook URL. The inclusion of system information and the method of data exfiltration strongly suggest malicious intent, specifically for unauthorized data theft and privacy invasion. The code does not contain obfuscated bytecode or typical obfuscation techniques, but the intent and actions are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is malicious, designed for stealing Discord tokens and personal data, then exfiltrating that data to an external webhook. Its operations align with typical token-stealing malware. It does not exhibit obfuscation, but its purpose is malicious and risky.",
