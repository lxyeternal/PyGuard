  "malware_score": 1,
  "security_risk": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0.3,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for credential theft and data exfiltration, with minimal obfuscation primarily through base64 encoding of the webhook URL. It poses a high security risk and should be considered malware. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score should be 1, security risk 1, and obfuscation around 0.2-0.3 reflecting the mild obfuscation. Overall, the behavior is consistent with a credential-stealing malware, and the reports' assessments are justified."
