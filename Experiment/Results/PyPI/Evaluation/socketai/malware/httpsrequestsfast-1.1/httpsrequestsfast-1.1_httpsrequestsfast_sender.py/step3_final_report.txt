{
  "purpose": "Provides base64 encoding and decoding of strings within the Sender class.",
  "sources": "Input strings passed to _encode_data and _decode_data methods.",
  "sinks": "Decoded data returned; no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method parameters through base64 encoding/decoding functions back to return values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation. Lack of exception handling noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility class for base64 encoding and decoding. It uses standard library functions without obfuscation, network activity, or system modifications. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. The absence of exception handling could cause runtime errors with invalid input, but this is a robustness issue, not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a straightforward data encoding utility. The minimal security concern is the lack of exception handling, which does not imply malicious behavior.",
