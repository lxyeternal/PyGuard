{
  "purpose": "The class provides methods to encode and decode data using Base64 encoding, likely for data transformation or simple obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Input data received via the '_encode_data' and '_decode_data' methods, which accept string data.",
  "sinks": "Encoded or decoded data returned as strings; no external data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Input string → encode_data or decode_data methods → Base64 encode/decode process → output string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods to encode and decode data using base64, a standard encoding scheme. There are no external data sources, no data being sent over the network, or external side effects. The methods are simple wrappers around base64 functions with standard encoding and decoding procedures. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident. The code appears to serve basic data encoding purposes without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides simple Base64 encoding and decoding functionality without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious logic.",
