{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for encoding and decoding data using Base64 encoding scheme.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to _encode_data and _decode_data methods",
  "sinks": "Output of _encode_data (encoded string), output of _decode_data (decoded string)",
  "flows": "Data received by _encode_data is encoded and returned; encoded data passed to _decode_data is decoded and returned",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual language features, or obfuscated code. Methods are straightforward; no external data sources or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The class 'Sender' contains two methods for Base64 encoding and decoding. No external inputs besides method parameters; no data leakage, no network communication, no file operations, or other suspicious behavior. The code is simple, standard, and appears benign. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident. The code's purpose appears to be data transformation only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for Base64 encoding and decoding, with no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
