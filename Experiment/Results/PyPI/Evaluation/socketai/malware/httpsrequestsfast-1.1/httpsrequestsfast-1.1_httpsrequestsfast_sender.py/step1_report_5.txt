  "purpose": "The code provides a simple class to encode and decode data using base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to _encode_data() and _decode_data() methods.",
  "sinks": "Encoded or decoded data returned by methods; no external sinks or data output mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Input string → encode_data() for encoding; encoded data → decode_data() for decoding.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. Methods are straightforward and only perform base64 transformations.",
  "analysis": "The class 'Sender' has methods for base64 encoding and decoding strings. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The methods are simple utility functions with no external side effects or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a basic utility for encoding and decoding data using base64. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The implementation is standard and does not perform any harmful actions.",
