{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for encoding and decoding data using Base64.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the method parameters `_encode_data` and `_decode_data`.",
  "sinks": "The encoded or decoded data could be used elsewhere; potential sinks include further processing, transmission, or storage, but no explicit data transmission or storage occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method input parameters through encoding or decoding functions, returning the processed data.",
  "anomalies": "The code only performs straightforward Base64 encoding/decoding with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. It does not perform any network communication or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Sender' with methods to encode and decode strings using Base64. The methods are simple wrappers around Python's base64 library. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscation. The implementation is straightforward and standard for data encoding purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic utility for Base64 encoding and decoding without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be benign and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
