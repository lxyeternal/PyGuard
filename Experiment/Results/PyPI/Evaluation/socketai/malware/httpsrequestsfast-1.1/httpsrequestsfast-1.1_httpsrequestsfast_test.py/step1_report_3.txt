  "purpose": "The code fetches geographical information for the IP address 8.8.8.8 from an external API and prints the IP address.",
  "sources": "requests.get() call to external API endpoint \"https://ipapi.co/8.8.8.8/json/\"",
  "sinks": "print(x[\"ip\"]) outputs the IP address to the console",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves data from the external API (source), then the IP address is extracted from the JSON response and printed (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no malicious indicators are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward HTTP GET request to an external API to retrieve information about a specific IP address (8.8.8.8). The response is parsed as JSON, and the IP address is printed. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The use of an external API for informational purposes is typical and does not suggest malicious activity. No sensitive data is handled or transmitted. The code is simple, clear, and functions as a basic utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs a legitimate, non-malicious action of retrieving and printing IP information. There are no security risks or malware indications.",
