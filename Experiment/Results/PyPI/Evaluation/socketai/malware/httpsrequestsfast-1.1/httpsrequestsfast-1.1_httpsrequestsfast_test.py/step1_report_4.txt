{
  "purpose": "The code queries an external API to retrieve and display the IP address of the provided input IP (8.8.8.8).",
  "sources": "requests.get call to https://ipapi.co/8.8.8.8/json/ and json() method parsing the response.",
  "sinks": "Printing the extracted IP address from the JSON response.",
  "flows": "requests.get fetches data from the external API (source), then json() parses the data, and print outputs the IP (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code makes a straightforward API call and prints a value.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple external API request to retrieve geolocation info for a fixed IP address and prints the IP. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of requests to access a public API is typical. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious data exfiltration, or suspicious data flows. The code does not process user input or untrusted data, limiting attack surface. The code appears to serve a benign purpose, likely for informational or testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and performs a straightforward API request to retrieve and display an IP address. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
