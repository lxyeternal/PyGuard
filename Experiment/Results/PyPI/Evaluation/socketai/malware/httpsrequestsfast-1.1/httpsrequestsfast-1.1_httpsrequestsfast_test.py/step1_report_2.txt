  "purpose": "Retrieve and print the IP address associated with the IP 8.8.8.8 using an external API.",
  "sources": "The line 'requests.get(\"https://ipapi.co/8.8.8.8/json/\").json()' reads data from the external API endpoint.",
  "sinks": "The data extracted from the API response is printed to standard output via 'print(x[\"ip\"])'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the external API (source) through the network request to the JSON parser, then to the print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code constructs; the code uses standard requests to fetch public data and prints it.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'requests' library, performs a GET request to an external API to fetch geolocation data for IP 8.8.8.8, and prints the IP address from the response. All operations are standard and benign, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors. The API call is predictable and part of normal data retrieval. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple utility to fetch and display IP address information from a public API. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues. It performs standard network I/O to a known public service without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
