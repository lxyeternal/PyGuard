  "purpose": "Retrieve and print the IP address information for 8.8.8.8 using an external API.",
  "sources": "requests.get() call to 'https://ipapi.co/8.8.8.8/json/' which fetches IP data from an external service.",
  "sinks": "print(x[\"ip\"]), which outputs the retrieved IP address to standard output.",
  "flows": "requests.get() fetches data from external API (source), then data is parsed as JSON and the IP address is printed (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The API call is straightforward. No suspicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code makes a single external request to a known IP geolocation API to retrieve data about a specific IP address (8.8.8.8). It then prints the IP address. The code is simple and does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, command execution, or connecting to suspicious domains. No sensitive information or credentials are used or leaked. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to IP information retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a basic IP lookup utility that fetches and prints IP data from a reputable service. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this code.",
