  "purpose": "The code retrieves the public IP address information for the IP 8.8.8.8 using an external API and prints the IP address.",
  "sources": "The requests.get() call to 'https://ipapi.co/8.8.8.8/json/' fetches data from an external API endpoint.",
  "sinks": "The print() statement outputs the IP address to standard output.",
  "flows": "The data flow is from the external API request (source) to the output via print (sink), with the JSON response being parsed for the IP address.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward API call. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious endpoints, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the requests library and defines a function 'test' which makes an HTTP GET request to a public API providing IP address information for the IP 8.8.8.8. It then extracts the 'ip' field from the JSON response and prints it. The operation is simple, intended to fetch and display IP info, and does not perform any data exfiltration, malicious payload, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign operation to retrieve and display IP address information from an external service. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
