  "analysis": "The code performs a benign external API request to a reputable service, parses the JSON response, and prints the IP address. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The external call introduces minimal privacy or security risk, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The external API call is standard and trustworthy. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 is justified due to external communication, but overall, the code poses no security threat.",
