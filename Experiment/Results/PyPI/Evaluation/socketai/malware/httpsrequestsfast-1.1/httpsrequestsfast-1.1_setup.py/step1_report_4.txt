  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup parameters for the Python package 'httpsrequestsfast'.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in this script.",
  "sinks": "The script does not include any sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely specifies package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'distutils.core' and calls 'setup' with package metadata including name, packages, version, license, description, author info, URLs, and dependencies. There are no inputs, outputs, or code execution beyond standard setup configuration. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are detected. The only dependency listed is 'requests', which is common for making HTTP requests. The code is standard boilerplate for Python packaging and contains no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
