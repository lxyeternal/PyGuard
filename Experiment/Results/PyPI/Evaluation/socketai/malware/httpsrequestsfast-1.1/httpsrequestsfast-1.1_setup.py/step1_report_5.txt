  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'httpsrequestsfast' for distribution via setup.py.",
  "sources": "Input data includes package metadata such as name, version, author info, URL, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No complex data flows; primarily static configuration data for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward package configuration with no unusual or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'distutils.core.setup' to configure package metadata. It specifies package details such as name, version, license, description, author info, URL, download URL, and required dependencies. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, or external data processing. The dependencies are standard and unremarkable. The code appears to be a standard, legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It only specifies package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
