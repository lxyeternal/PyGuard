  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read 'README.md' without error handling; no validation or sanitization of data. No suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for a Python package, importing 'setuptools' functions. It reads a local README file for the long description, which is typical. Dependencies are 'requests' and 'colorama', both common libraries. No code injection, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior observed. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or unusual patterns. The code adheres to standard packaging practices with no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
