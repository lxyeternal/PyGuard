      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The minor issue of unhandled file reading does not elevate the security risk. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk (~0.1). The overall assessment confirms the code's safety."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity. The main security concern is the use of 'import *' from a local module, which could hide malicious code if src_file is compromised. Overall, the malware score should be 0, with a slight obfuscation concern reflected in a score around 0.2, and a low security risk score (~0.2). Further inspection of src_file is recommended for a definitive assessment."
