  "purpose": "Import all contents from a local module named src_file and initialize colorama for terminal color support.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .src_file, call to initialize() from colorama",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present in this snippet; potential for imported code to contain sinks if used later",
  "flows": "N/A in this snippet; no data flow observable",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .src_file import *' can obscure imported functions and variables, potentially hiding malicious code, but not malicious by itself; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a local module and calls colorama's initialize function. This is common for setting up terminal coloring. No explicit malicious activity or suspicious behavior is evident in this minimal snippet. The use of wildcard import is generally discouraged, but it does not indicate malicious intent by itself. No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are visible here. Without inspecting src_file, no further malicious analysis can be performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard initialization tasks and imports, with no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. The use of wildcard import is a concern for code clarity but not malicious.",
