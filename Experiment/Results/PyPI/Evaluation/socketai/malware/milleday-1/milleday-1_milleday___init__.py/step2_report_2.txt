  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the provided details.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .src_file import *\nfrom colorama import *\ninitialize()\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import local module and initialize colorama.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity. The wildcard import from `src_file` could hide malicious code if present, but there's no evidence here.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, reflecting caution about wildcard import)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Verdict:** **Reasonable.** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Malware score:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** Similar reasoning; wildcard import could hide malicious code, but none evident.\n- **Risk score:** 0.4 (moderate, due to potential for hidden malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2\n- **Verdict:** **Acceptable.** The cautious score reflects the risk of hidden malicious code in `src_file`.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; concerns about wildcard import are acknowledged but not considered malicious.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; the main concern is the import method.\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 (slightly higher, considering the potential for malicious code hiding)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Verdict:** **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; wildcard import can obscure code but is not malicious by itself.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, reflecting minimal concern)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code performs imports and initialization.\n- The primary concern is the use of `from .src_file import *`, which can hide malicious code if `src_file` is compromised.\n- None of the reports provide evidence of malicious activity in the code snippet itself.\n- Malware scores are consistently low (0 or 0.2), which aligns with the analysis.\n- Risk scores are generally low, with some moderate caution where the import method is concerned.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Given the code snippet, the malware score should remain at **0**, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The use of `import *` from a local module is somewhat obfuscating, so a score of **0.2** seems appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is minimal and benign but with potential for hidden malicious code in `src_file`, a cautious risk score of **0.2-0.3** is justified.\n\n**Overall, I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the cautious stance of the reports but recognizes that no malicious activity is evident from this code snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The main security concern is the content of `src_file`. Without inspecting it, the risk remains primarily due to the wildcard import. If further details about `src_file` are available, a deeper analysis could be performed.",
