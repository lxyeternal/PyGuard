  "purpose": "Import all contents from a local module 'src_file' and initialize colorama for terminal color support.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module 'src_file' and the 'initialize()' call from colorama.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing; no network or system modification calls present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; only imports and an initialization call are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .src_file import *' can lead to unclear namespace pollution, which is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious. The use of 'initialize()' from colorama is benign. No suspicious or obfuscated code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a local module, which can obscure the actual code executed and may hide malicious code if present in 'src_file'. The call to 'initialize()' is part of setting up colorama for terminal output and is a common, safe practice. No network activity, credential handling, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a setup snippet for a terminal-based Python application. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code patterns in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard import and initialization actions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. Its primary concern is the use of 'import *', which reduces code clarity but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
