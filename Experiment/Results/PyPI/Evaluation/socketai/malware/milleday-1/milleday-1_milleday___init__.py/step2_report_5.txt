  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .src_file import *\nfrom colorama import *\ninitialize()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code performs **import *** from a local module (`src_file`) and from `colorama`.\n- Calls `initialize()` from `colorama`.\n\n**Note:** The code itself is minimal, with no network activity, no data handling, and no explicit malicious operations.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies imports and initialization.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes the potential risk of `import *` from `src_file` but states no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.7, Obfuscated: 0, Malware: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The risk score is low, which is appropriate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Highlights that `import *` can hide malicious code, but in itself, no malicious activity is confirmed.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.2, SecurityRisk: 0.4, Confidence: 0.4.\n\n**Assessment:** The malware score of 0.2 seems somewhat high given no evidence of malicious code. The reasoning suggests potential concern but does not confirm malicious intent. I would **lower the malware score to 0** and keep the security risk low, perhaps around 0.2, reflecting the concern about obscured code but no evidence.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same observations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly points out that `import *` can obscure code, but no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes that `import *` can hide malicious code but states no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.3, Confidence: 0.6.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes that `import *` can obscure code but is not malicious by itself.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.1, Confidence: 0.7.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the main concern is the use of `import *` from a local module (`src_file`), which could hide malicious code.\n- The actual code snippet does **not** contain any malicious activity, network calls, or data leaks.\n- The **malware score** should be **0** across all reports unless there's evidence of malicious code, which isn't provided here.\n- The **security risk** is low, given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious operations.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware scores:** Should be **0** in all cases.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Slightly above 0 if `import *` is used, but since the content of `src_file` is unknown, a small value (e.g., 0.2) can be acceptable, but given no evidence, 0 is better.\n- **Risk scores:** Keep low unless evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Justification |\n|---------|----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0              | 0            | 0.2            | No malicious activity; wildcard import is risky but not malicious. |\n| 2       | 0              | 0.2          | 0.2            | Obfuscation concern, but no evidence of malicious code. |\n| 3       | 0              | 0            | 0.2            | Standard import; no malicious activity. |\n| 4       | 0              | 0            | 0.3            | Similar reasoning; no malicious code. |\n| 5       | 0              | 0            | 0.1            | No malicious activity; minimal risk. |\n\n---\n\n### **Final conclusion:**\n\n**Based on the provided code snippet and reports, the actual malware risk is negligible (0).**  \nThe obfuscation score can be slightly above zero due to the use of `import *`, but without inspecting `src_file`, we cannot confirm malicious intent.  \nThe overall security risk remains low.\n\n**Therefore, I recommend setting:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.2** (to reflect the potential risk of wildcard import)  \n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (consistent with low but cautious assessment)\n\nThis approach balances the potential for hidden malicious code with the lack of concrete evidence.",
