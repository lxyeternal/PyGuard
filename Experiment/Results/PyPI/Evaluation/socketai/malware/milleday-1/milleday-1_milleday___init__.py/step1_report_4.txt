{
  "purpose": "Import all contents from a local source module and initialize the colorama library, likely for terminal styling.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .src_file and call to initialize() from colorama.",
  "sinks": "initialize() may modify terminal behavior; no direct data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Import from local module; then initialize() affects terminal output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .src_file import *' can obscure imported content; no obvious malicious activity but can hide malicious code within src_file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a local module, which could conceal malicious code if src_file contains malicious payloads or backdoors. The call to colorama.initialize() is standard for setting up terminal colors. There are no evident suspicious network connections, data leaks, or malicious system modifications. However, the use of wildcard import and local source file without further inspection raises potential concerns about hidden malicious code, especially if src_file is malicious or compromised. Overall, the code itself appears benign, but the imported source could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard library initialization and local imports; no direct malicious behavior is apparent. The main concern is the contents of src_file, which could contain malicious code. Additional review of src_file is recommended to rule out hidden threats.",
