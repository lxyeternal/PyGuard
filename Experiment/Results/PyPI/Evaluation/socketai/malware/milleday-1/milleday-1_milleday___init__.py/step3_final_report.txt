  "purpose": "Minimal setup code importing all symbols from a local module and colorama, then initializing terminal styling.",
  "sources": "Imports from .src_file and colorama; call to initialize()",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or network activity present",
  "flows": "Import statements followed by initialize() call; no data flow to external systems",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' from a local module which can obscure imported symbols",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign imports and initializes colorama for terminal styling. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The wildcard import from src_file can hide malicious code if src_file is compromised, but this cannot be confirmed without inspecting src_file. The initialize() call is standard and safe. Scores should reflect low malware likelihood and minimal security risk, primarily noting the import style as a potential obfuscation concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity. The main security concern is the use of 'import *' from a local module, which could hide malicious code if src_file is compromised. Overall, the malware score should be 0, with a slight obfuscation concern reflected in a score around 0.2, and a low security risk score (~0.2). Further inspection of src_file is recommended for a definitive assessment.",
