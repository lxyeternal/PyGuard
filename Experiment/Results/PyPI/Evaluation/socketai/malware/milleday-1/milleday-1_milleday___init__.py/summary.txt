  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity. The main security concern is the use of 'import *' from a local module, which could hide malicious code if src_file is compromised. Overall, the malware score should be 0, with a slight obfuscation concern reflected in a score around 0.2, and a low security risk score (~0.2). Further inspection of src_file is recommended for a definitive assessment."
