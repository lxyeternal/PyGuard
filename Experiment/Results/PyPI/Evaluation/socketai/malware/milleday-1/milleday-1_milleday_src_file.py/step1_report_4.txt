{
  "purpose": "The code collects sensitive user data, including wallet files, configuration, and credentials from the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet, compresses this data into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates it via Telegram bot messages and document uploads.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables for user directories, specific wallet and config files (e.g., exodus.conf.json, seed.seco, passphrase.json), and system information like IP address and country code via HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration occurs through HTTP POST requests to Telegram API endpoints for sending messages and documents, transmitting sensitive user data and system info to an external attacker-controlled Telegram bot.",
  "flows": "The code gathers sensitive files and system info, compiles them into a ZIP archive, and then uploads this archive to Telegram using the bot API, thus creating a source-to-sink data flow from local files and system info to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, use of environment variables for sensitive directories, and the absence of any user consent or notification. The code also secretly exfiltrates user data without any explicit user interaction, indicating malicious intent. The message includes suspicious branding '[🧬]  1337 Wallet Stealer [🧬]', and the process is automated without user awareness.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by collecting user-specific paths and credentials, then checks for the existence of specific wallet-related files and directories. If such data exists, it archives the data into a ZIP file, appends a malicious message, and exfiltrates the data via Telegram API. It also collects IP and country information for context. The presence of hardcoded API tokens, filenames related to sensitive wallet data, and the automated exfiltration strongly suggest malicious intent aimed at theft of cryptocurrency wallet data. There is no evidence of obfuscation; the code is straightforward but designed for stealthy data theft. Overall, it exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior with high-confidence indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, functioning as a wallet stealer that exfiltrates sensitive user data and system information to an attacker-controlled Telegram account. It operates covertly, without user consent, and includes hardcoded credentials for remote data transfer. The overall security risk is extremely high.",
