{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect sensitive wallet and configuration files from the user's system and transmit them via Telegram, potentially for malicious data theft.",
  "sources": "User's environment variables, specific file paths related to Exodus wallet data, and system directories; also external HTTP requests to IP geolocation services.",
  "sinks": "Requests to Telegram API endpoints, writing and reading files locally, and network requests that transmit collected data.",
  "flows": "Sensitive files are collected from specific paths and added into a ZIP archive, which is then sent over the network via Telegram API calls, along with geolocation data.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token, hardcoded file paths to wallet data, and the behavior of exfiltrating user data without consent; no legitimate application purpose is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves user-specific directories and sensitive wallet files, compresses them into a ZIP archive, and sends both the data and geolocation information to a Telegram bot. The use of hardcoded credentials, the collection of wallet data, and network transmission without user consent indicate malicious intent. The code does not include any legitimate functionality, nor does it include safeguards for user privacy. It actively exfiltrates potentially private information, consistent with data theft behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions as a wallet stealer, exfiltrating sensitive wallet files and user geolocation data to an attacker-controlled Telegram bot. It exhibits clear malicious behavior with high confidence. The code is not obfuscated but intentionally malicious, and the security risk is extremely high.",
