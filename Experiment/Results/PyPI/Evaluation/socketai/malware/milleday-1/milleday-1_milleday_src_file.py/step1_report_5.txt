{
  "purpose": "This script appears to collect sensitive wallet and configuration files related to Exodus cryptocurrency wallet, compress them into a ZIP archive, and then exfiltrate the archive along with system IP information via Telegram messages and document uploads.",
  "sources": "User directories for wallet files, configuration files, and potentially sensitive data files such as exodus.txt, seed, passphrase, wallet info, and related config files.",
  "sinks": "Telegram API endpoints used for sending messages and documents; requests to external IP API for geolocation data.",
  "flows": "Collects wallet/config files -> compresses files into ZIP -> gathers IP info -> sends message and ZIP file via Telegram bot API.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; concatenation of system data and exfiltration commands; collection of potentially sensitive wallet data without user consent; no user notification or permission requests; use of requests to external IP geolocation service for tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code's main function is to locate specific wallet and configuration files associated with Exodus, package them into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrate the data by sending a message and the ZIP document to a Telegram bot. It uses a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, which are typical indicators of malicious intent. The code collects system IP and country code info for potential tracking or identification purposes. It handles sensitive wallet files in a way that suggests theft or malicious data collection, with no user interaction or consent. The exfiltration process involves sending both textual information and files over the internet, which can be used maliciously. There are no obfuscation techniques; the code is straightforward but suspicious due to its purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to steal sensitive wallet and configuration files, package them, and exfiltrate them via Telegram, indicating malicious intent. It employs hardcoded credentials and collects system data for tracking. Overall, this code constitutes a malicious wallet stealer with a high security risk.",
