{
  "purpose": "The code collects sensitive user data, including wallet information and system details, zips these files, and exfiltrates them via Telegram, likely for theft or unauthorized access.",
  "sources": "Reads system environment variables, user-specific file paths, and makes HTTP GET requests to retrieve IP and country code; reads several wallet-related files and configuration files from user directories.",
  "sinks": "Sends messages and files through Telegram API endpoints, including user wallet data and system IP info, which are exfiltrated over the network.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from user files and system info, then compressed into a ZIP archive, and finally transmitted via Telegram API calls to a remote server, indicating an exfiltration flow.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; extensive collection of wallet and configuration files, likely sensitive. The code does not verify the integrity or purpose of files before collecting. The message content suggests malicious intent ('Wallet Stealer'). Use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by retrieving user-specific paths and environment variables. It checks for the existence of wallet-related files or directories, then collects these files into a ZIP archive. It also gathers external IP and country code via HTTP requests. The collected data, including wallet files and system info, is exfiltrated by sending a message and document to a Telegram bot, using hardcoded credentials. The use of these credentials, along with the nature of the collected files, strongly indicates malicious intent to steal wallet data. The code's structure, including exception suppression and the extraction of sensitive files, suggests it is designed to operate covertly. The overall behavior aligns with data theft malware, specifically targeting cryptocurrency wallets.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear malicious intent by exfiltrating sensitive wallet data and system info via Telegram. It employs hardcoded credentials, targets user files, and transmits data covertly, fitting the profile of a wallet-stealing malware. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered unsafe for use.",
