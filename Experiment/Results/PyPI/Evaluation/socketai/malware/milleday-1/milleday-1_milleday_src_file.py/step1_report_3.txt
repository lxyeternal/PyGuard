{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather sensitive user data related to Exodus cryptocurrency wallet files and uploads it to a remote server via Telegram API.",
  "sources": "User environment variables, file system (specific wallet files and configuration files), network request to IP-API and Telegram API",
  "sinks": "Telegram API endpoints for sending messages and documents, file system (creating and deleting ZIP files), network requests to external IP geolocation service",
  "flows": "User data files are collected and compressed into a ZIP archive, then the ZIP file is sent via Telegram API; IP address and country code are retrieved and included in the message.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token, static file paths pointing to sensitive wallet data, immediate data exfiltration after collecting files, minimal error handling, use of requests without validation, encoding of country flag characters, and possible obfuscation of intentions through the use of vague messaging and data collection.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by obtaining user-specific paths and environment variables. If certain wallet-related files or directories exist, it creates a ZIP archive containing these files, along with configuration and wallet data. It then fetches the user's external IP address and country code from an IP geolocation API, encodes the country flag, and constructs a message. The collected data and the message are sent to a Telegram bot via its API, including an exfiltration of potentially sensitive wallet information. The code exhibits behavior characteristic of credential theft and data exfiltration, with no legitimate user consent indicated. The static token and specific file targeting strongly suggest malicious intent, designed to steal user wallet data covertly.",
  "conclusion": "This code acts as a wallet stealer by collecting Exodus wallet files and configuration data, compressing them, and exfiltrating the information via Telegram. It employs static secrets and targets user wallet data without apparent consent, indicating malicious behavior.",
