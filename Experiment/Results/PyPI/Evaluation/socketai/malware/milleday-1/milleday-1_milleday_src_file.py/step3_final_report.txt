{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates wallet and configuration files from the user's system, compresses them into a ZIP archive, and sends the data via Telegram API, including geolocation information, without user consent.",
  "sources": "Wallet files, configuration files, environment variables, and external IP geolocation services.",
  "sinks": "Telegram API endpoints for sending messages and documents.",
  "flows": "Wallet/config files and geolocation data are collected from sources, compressed into ZIP, and transmitted to a remote Telegram bot via HTTP POST requests.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, collection of sensitive files without user notification, use of broad exception handling to suppress errors, active data exfiltration, no obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers sensitive wallet data and configuration files from user directories, creates a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates it via Telegram API. It also retrieves IP and country information through external requests. The presence of hardcoded credentials, direct access to sensitive files, and covert transmission indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and operates silently. The behavior aligns with typical wallet-stealing malware, with active data theft and no user notification, confirming malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as wallet-stealing malware, exfiltrating sensitive user data and system information to an attacker-controlled Telegram account. The behavior is unequivocally malicious, with high severity and security risk.",
