  "malware_score": 0.85,
  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell payloads triggered conditionally, representing a high security risk. The behavior aligns with common malware tactics such as obfuscation, stealth, and conditional execution. Scores assigned in the reports are justified; decoding the payload is recommended for definitive analysis."
