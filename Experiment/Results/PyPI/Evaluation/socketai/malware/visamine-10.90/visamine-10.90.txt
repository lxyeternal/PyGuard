      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell payloads triggered conditionally, representing a high security risk. The behavior aligns with common malware tactics such as obfuscation, stealth, and conditional execution. Scores assigned in the reports are justified; decoding the payload is recommended for definitive analysis."
