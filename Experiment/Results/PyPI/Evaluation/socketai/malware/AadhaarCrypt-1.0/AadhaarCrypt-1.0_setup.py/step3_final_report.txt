  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data sources; static code with imports and function call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "N/A; code executes setup configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of setuptools with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and calls setup() with static parameters. It uses find_packages() to discover sub-packages. There are no external inputs, no data flows, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behaviors. The code is a minimal, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
