  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the original code.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\nsetup(name = \"AadhaarCrypt\", version = \"1.0\", packages = find_packages())\n```\n\n---\n\n### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Standard packaging setup.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no external input, straightforward.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign.\n\n### Report 2:\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, standard setup.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 3:\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no external data, straightforward.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 4:\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5:\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a standard, benign setup script.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** Should be **0**. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be **0**. The code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be **0**. No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Note:** Given the code's simplicity, there's no reason to assign any higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No modifications needed.",
