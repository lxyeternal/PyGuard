{
  "purpose": "The code is used to configure the packaging and distribution of a Python project named 'AadhaarCrypt'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package configuration data from the setuptools module and the find_packages function to identify package modules to include.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks in this code, as it only involves setup configuration without data processing or external data handling.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing functions from setuptools and passing package metadata to the setup function, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and typical for Python packaging; no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from the 'setuptools' library, then calls 'setup' with package name, version, and package discovery parameters. It performs standard package setup procedures with no indications of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security issues. There are no inputs from external sources, no dangerous functions, and no unusual code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard setup code for packaging a Python project, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
