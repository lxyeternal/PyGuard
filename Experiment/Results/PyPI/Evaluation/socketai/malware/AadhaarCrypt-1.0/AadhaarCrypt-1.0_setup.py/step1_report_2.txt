  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to critical functions; the script primarily calls setup routines with predefined arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed; the script is a standard packaging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script utilizing setuptools to prepare a package named 'AadhaarCrypt'. It calls 'find_packages()' to locate all packages in the current directory and passes them to 'setup()'. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. It appears to be a legitimate build script for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected functions for package distribution without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
