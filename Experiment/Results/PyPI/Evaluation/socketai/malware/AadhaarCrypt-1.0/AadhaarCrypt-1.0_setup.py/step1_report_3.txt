{
  "purpose": "The code is used to configure the packaging and distribution of a Python project named 'AadhaarCrypt'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package information from the 'setuptools' module and the 'find_packages()' function, which inspects the current directory for Python packages.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform data output that could leak information.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing 'setuptools', executing 'find_packages()' to identify packages, and passing this data to 'setup()' for packaging; there are no data flows involving external inputs or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code uses standard packaging practices with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal setup script for a Python package, using common functions from 'setuptools'. It simply defines the package name, version, and detects sub-packages automatically. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security issues. The code does not handle user input or external data beyond package discovery, and it performs a straightforward packaging task.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It follows typical conventions for package configuration and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code.",
