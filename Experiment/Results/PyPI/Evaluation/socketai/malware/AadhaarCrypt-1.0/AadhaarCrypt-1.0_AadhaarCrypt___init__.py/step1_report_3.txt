  "flows": "Source data (hostname, username, package name, path) -> encode -> split into parts -> send via DNS ping and HTTP requests",
  "anomalies": "Use of ping to encode data in DNS domain names, multiple methods for HTTP communication, obfuscated data encoding, consistent try-except blocks suppress errors",
  "analysis": "The script collects system information (hostname, username, current directory, package name) and encodes this data into a base64 string. It then splits the encoded data into segments, encodes each segment into hexadecimal, and sends the data covertly via DNS ping requests and HTTP requests to a suspicious domain. The use of ping to transmit data through DNS queries, combined with multiple HTTP request methods (urllib, requests), indicates an attempt to exfiltrate data covertly. The code lacks any malicious payload or destructive actions but is clearly designed for data leakage or command and control communication. The obfuscation through encoding and the multi-channel approach are typical of stealthy data exfiltration tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a covert data exfiltration script that encodes and transmits system information via DNS and HTTP channels. It does not perform destructive actions but is designed for surreptitious data theft, indicating malicious intent with high confidence.",
