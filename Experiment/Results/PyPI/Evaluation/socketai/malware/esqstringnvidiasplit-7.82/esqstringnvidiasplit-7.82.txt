      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to the execution of an obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell command during setup. The silent error handling and suspicious domain further support this. The scores are justified, indicating a high likelihood of malicious activity and significant security risk. The package should be treated as compromised or malicious pending further decoding and analysis of the payload."
