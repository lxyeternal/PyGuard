  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 1's code has signs of obfuscation and potential malicious behavior, warranting a malware score of approximately 0.6 and obfuscation score of 0.6. Other reports are benign with scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation. The overall security risk for Report 1 is justified at 0.6, while others remain low. Slightly increasing the malware score for Report 1 from 0.4 to around 0.6 would better reflect the suspicious features identified."
