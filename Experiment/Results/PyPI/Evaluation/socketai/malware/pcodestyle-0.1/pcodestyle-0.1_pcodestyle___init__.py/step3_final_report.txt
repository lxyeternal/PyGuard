  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic code execution ('exec', 'eval'), environment variables, module imports based on variable strings, data flows from untrusted sources to network or system calls.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, system commands, file operations, environment variables, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or untrusted input flow through dynamic import or execution functions to sinks like network or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec'/'eval' on untrusted data, dynamic module imports, suspicious string patterns, signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, complex or misleading code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are high-risk indicators. The presence of 'exec'/'eval' on untrusted data and dynamic imports suggest potential malicious intent, justifying a malware score around 0.5-0.6. No explicit malicious payloads or backdoors are confirmed, but behaviors warrant caution. Other reports show benign patterns with no suspicious activity, justifying low malware and obfuscation scores. The overall security risk aligns with the suspicion level, with Report 1 being the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 1's code has signs of obfuscation and potential malicious behavior, warranting a malware score of approximately 0.6 and obfuscation score of 0.6. Other reports are benign with scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation. The overall security risk for Report 1 is justified at 0.6, while others remain low. Slightly increasing the malware score for Report 1 from 0.4 to around 0.6 would better reflect the suspicious features identified.",
