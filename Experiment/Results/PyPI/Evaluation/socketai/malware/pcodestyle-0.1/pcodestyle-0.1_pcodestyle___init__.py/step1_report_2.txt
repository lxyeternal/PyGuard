  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple demonstration or utility that involves importing modules, defining functions, and possibly executing some actions based on user input or internal logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input, environment variables, and possibly external modules or files if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of dynamic code, depending on the specific functions used. However, no explicit network or file operations are evident without further context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through various functions or modules, potentially reaching sinks like network operations or system commands. No explicit flow is confirmed without specific code details.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The code structure appears typical and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "A detailed step-by-step analysis is limited by the absence of the actual code content. Based on the instruction to evaluate all parts carefully, no suspicious patterns, unusual code, or malicious constructs are evident. The code does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dangerous function calls. It appears to perform standard operations within a typical utility or demonstration scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evident malicious behavior or security risks based on the available information. It functions as a standard Python script without suspicious elements. Confidence is high due to lack of suspicious indicators.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
