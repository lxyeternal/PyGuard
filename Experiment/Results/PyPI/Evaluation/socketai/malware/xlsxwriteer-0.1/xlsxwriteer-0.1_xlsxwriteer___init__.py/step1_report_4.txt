  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python package or script, potentially involving some data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown, but common sources include environment variables, user input, or file reads (if present). No clear data input functions are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if invoked elsewhere. However, no explicit sinks like socket communications, system calls, or file writes are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows observable in this code fragment. It primarily consists of function definitions and variable assignments without data propagation from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are present. No unusual or deceptive language features are detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code includes standard imports, function definitions, and control structures. There are no indications of dynamic execution, obfuscated logic, or hidden behaviors. All components seem typical for a utility module. Without external context or additional code, no malicious activities or anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the visible code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign and standard. Due to limited context, confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
