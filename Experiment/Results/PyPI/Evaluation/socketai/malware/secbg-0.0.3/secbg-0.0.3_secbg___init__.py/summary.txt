  "malware_score": 0.6,
  "security_risk": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0.6,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior through dynamic subprocess execution and the import of a non-standard 'popen' module, which could be used maliciously or obfuscated. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware suspicion is significant enough to warrant further review. Adjusted scores reflect this moderate threat level, emphasizing caution."
