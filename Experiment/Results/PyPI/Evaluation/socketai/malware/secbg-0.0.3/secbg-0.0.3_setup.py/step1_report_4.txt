  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'secbg' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Package metadata provided directly in the setup() function: name, version, description, packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks; the code is purely declarative package setup.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated elements, or suspicious constructs; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static package metadata. No external input, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior present. The purpose is to define package info for distribution, which is typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
