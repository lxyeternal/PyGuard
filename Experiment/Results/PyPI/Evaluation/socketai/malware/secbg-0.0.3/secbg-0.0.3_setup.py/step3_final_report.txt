  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded package metadata within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input; no data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "N/A - static code with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with fixed parameters: name, version, description, and packages. It contains no dynamic code, external input, obfuscation, or suspicious functions. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, standard package configuration. No signs of malware, data leaks, or security issues are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The security and malware scores are correctly set to zero, and the overall assessment confirms its benign status.",
