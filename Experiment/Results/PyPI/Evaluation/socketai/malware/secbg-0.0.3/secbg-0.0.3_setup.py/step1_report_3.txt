{
  "purpose": "To define and package the 'secbg' Python module for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only specifies package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for a setup script; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with basic package metadata: name, version, description, and packages. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no embedded malicious behavior. It appears to be a straightforward packaging script for a Python module.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script used for packaging a Python module. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
