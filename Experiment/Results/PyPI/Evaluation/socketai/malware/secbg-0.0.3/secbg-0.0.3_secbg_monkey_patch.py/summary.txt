  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily aimed at environment-aware network and request handling modifications, with no explicit malicious payloads. Its extensive patching and environment-dependent behavior introduce moderate security risks, particularly for traffic manipulation or covert request tracking. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.55, reflecting caution due to its capabilities rather than malicious intent."
