  "purpose": "Serialize Django model objects and querysets into dictionaries, optionally including deserialized protobuf extended info.",
  "sources": "model_to_dict(obj), obj.ext_info_proto()",
  "sinks": "pb_to_dict() potentially processes protobuf data, model_to_dict() processes model data",
  "flows": "model_to_dict() reads model data, pb_to_dict() reads protobuf data from ext_info_proto()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. Use of protobuf conversion is standard for serialization.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward serialization functions for Django models and querysets. It includes optional deserialization of protobuf data. All functions rely on imported utilities, with no apparent suspicious logic. There are no evident data leaks, malicious code, or malicious behavior such as network communication or system manipulation. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present. The use of protobuf and model serialization is standard practice and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign serialization utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply serializes model data and optional protobuf info for likely internal use.",
