{
  "purpose": "The code provides serialization functions to convert Django model instances and querysets into dictionaries, with optional deserialization of protobuf data.",
  "sources": "Reads data from Django model objects (model_to_dict), protobuf objects (pb_to_dict), and model attributes (obj.ext_info_proto())",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or outputs data to external systems; the functions return data structures",
  "flows": "Data flows from Django model objects and protobuf data through serialization functions back into Python dictionaries and lists",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code structures detected. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The functions primarily convert Django model instances and querysets into dictionary formats. The optional deserialization of protobuf data could be a point of concern if the protobuf data is maliciously crafted; however, as it is a straightforward conversion, it is unlikely to be malicious. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoors present. The code relies on external libraries for data conversion, which are standard for Django and protobuf handling. Overall, the code appears to be a standard serialization utility without malicious intent or dangerous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical serialization utility for Django models with optional protobuf handling. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk score is low, with no significant threats detected.",
