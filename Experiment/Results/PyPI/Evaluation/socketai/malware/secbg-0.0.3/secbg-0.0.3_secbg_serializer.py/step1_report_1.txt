  "purpose": "The code serializes Django model objects and querysets into dictionaries, with optional protobuf deserialization for extended info.",
  "sources": "model_to_dict(obj), obj.ext_info_proto()",
  "sinks": "Data returned in dictionaries, potentially logged or transmitted",
  "flows": "model_to_dict outputs -> optional pb_to_dict -> returned data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code. The functions perform standard serialization tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard utility functions for model serialization and protobuf conversion, then defines functions to serialize individual Django model instances and querysets. The functions conditionally include deserialized protobuf data if 'with_extinfo' is True. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to perform straightforward serialization. No suspicious or malicious code constructs identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard serialization of Django models and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for data processing tasks within an application.",
