  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward serialization with optional protobuf deserialization",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard serialization of Django models and querysets, with optional protobuf extension info deserialization. It relies on external utility functions presumed safe. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The only potential concern is the deserialization of protobuf data, which could be risky if the data source is untrusted, but this is external to the code itself. The malware score is 0, as no malicious behavior is evident. The security risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting the potential danger of deserializing untrusted protobuf data. The code is clear, straightforward, and safe under normal assumptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard serialization utility with minimal external risk due to protobuf deserialization. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The scores are appropriate, with a very low security risk primarily due to external data concerns.",
