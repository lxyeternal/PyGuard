  "purpose": "To serialize Django model objects and querysets into Python dictionaries, optionally including deserialized protobuf data.",
  "sources": "model_to_dict(obj), obj.ext_info_proto()",
  "sinks": "Data returned by serialize and serialize_queryset functions",
  "flows": "model_to_dict extracts data from the Django model object; pb_to_dict potentially deserializes protobuf data from obj.ext_info_proto()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of protobuf deserialization is standard but should be verified for input safety.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for serialization: one for individual Django model objects, and another for querysets. It uses common, presumably safe, utility functions for model-to-dict conversion and protobuf deserialization. No input validation or sanitization is present, but the functions rely on the external utility functions which are assumed to be standard. The code appears straightforward and intended for data serialization, with no evident malicious behavior or suspicious logic. There is no network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated code. The protobuf deserialization could be a potential vector if obj.ext_info_proto() contains malicious payloads, but this depends on external data sources, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard serialization utility with no malicious intent. It relies on external functions that are presumed to be safe. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent within this code snippet.",
