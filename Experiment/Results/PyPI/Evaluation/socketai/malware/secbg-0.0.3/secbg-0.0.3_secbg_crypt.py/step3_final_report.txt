  "purpose": "AES CBC encryption and decryption of client IP addresses with manual PKCS#7 padding.",
  "sources": "Input data: raw IP string; key parameter for encryption/decryption.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted output in base64; decrypted plaintext returned as bytes.",
  "flows": "raw input + padding -> IV generation -> cipher creation -> encryption -> base64 encode; base64 decode -> IV extraction -> cipher -> decryption -> remove padding.",
  "anomalies": "Manual padding with chr() instead of standard PKCS#7; unused import 'common.crypt'; no input validation or key validation shown.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AES CBC encryption with proper IV handling and base64 encoding. Padding is manually implemented via chr(), which is functional but non-standard. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The import 'common.crypt' is unused, possibly indicating incomplete code. No suspicious network activity or malicious behavior is evident. The implementation aligns with typical cryptographic routines, with minor security concerns about padding and key management outside this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of AES CBC encryption/decryption for client IP addresses. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent. The main issues are the non-standard padding method and lack of input validation, which are common in cryptographic code but do not indicate malicious activity.",
