{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for encrypting and decrypting client IP addresses using AES encryption in CBC mode with base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'key' and 'raw' in encrypt_client_ip; 'key' and 'enc' in decrypt_client_ip.",
  "sinks": "Base64 encoding of encrypted data, decryption of data; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'raw' data is padded and encrypted with a key, resulting in base64 output; encrypted data is decoded, IV extracted, and data decrypted to retrieve original 'raw'.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses 'chr' for padding, which can be problematic with non-ASCII data; no explicit validation or key management, but these are common in encryption routines.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard AES CBC encryption and decryption functions, including IV generation and base64 encoding. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are present. Usage of cryptographic libraries appears appropriate, and no obfuscation or malware signs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides standard encryption/decryption functions without malicious intent. It appears secure for legitimate purposes, assuming proper key management elsewhere. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected within this code fragment.",
