{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for encrypting and decrypting client IP addresses using AES encryption in CBC mode with base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "Input data: 'raw' parameter for encryption, 'enc' parameter for decryption, and 'key' for both functions.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted output returned as base64-encoded string, potential for data leakage if keys are mishandled.",
  "flows": "Raw IP + padding -> AES encryption with key and IV -> base64 encode -> output; base64 decode -> AES decryption -> remove padding -> output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of raw string concatenation for padding (not standard PKCS7), no validation of inputs, use of a potentially insecure random IV generation, no explicit key handling or key validation shown, no suspicious network activity or data leaks evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs symmetric encryption of data with AES CBC mode, applying manual padding. It generates an IV with Crypto.Random, which is appropriate for cryptographic purposes. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The functions appear to perform standard encryption/decryption routines for IP addresses, with no evident malicious behavior or backdoors. The padding method is not standard but functionally correct; however, it could be improved for security. Overall, no malicious intent or suspicious activity is detected based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard AES CBC encryption and decryption functions for client IP addresses without any signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be legitimate encryption utility code, with no indications of malware or security risks beyond potential padding concerns.",
