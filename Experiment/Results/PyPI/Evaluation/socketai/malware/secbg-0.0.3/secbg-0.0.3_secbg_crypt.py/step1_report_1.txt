  "purpose": "This code provides encryption and decryption functions for client IP addresses using AES encryption in CBC mode.",
  "sources": "Input data: 'key' parameter (encryption key), 'raw' (plaintext IP address), 'enc' (encrypted data).",
  "sinks": "Encrypted output via base64 encoding, decryption returning plaintext IP.",
  "flows": "Key and raw data are input, raw data is padded and encrypted to produce cipher text, which can then be decoded and decrypted back to plaintext.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard cryptographic procedures are used. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AES CBC encryption with PKCS#7 padding. It uses the 'Crypto' library's Random module to generate an IV. The encrypt function pads the raw data, prepends the IV, encrypts, and encodes it in base64. The decrypt function reverses this process, decoding from base64, extracting the IV, decrypting, and unpadding. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The functions are typical for secure symmetric encryption.\n\nPotential concerns include the absence of key validation or management, but this does not indicate malicious intent; rather, it is typical cryptographic usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard cryptographic functions for encrypting and decrypting client IP addresses. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security sabotage. It is a straightforward implementation of AES CBC mode encryption with proper IV handling.",
