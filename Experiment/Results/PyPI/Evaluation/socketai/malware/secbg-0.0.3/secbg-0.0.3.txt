      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior through dynamic subprocess execution and the import of a non-standard 'popen' module, which could be used maliciously or obfuscated. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware suspicion is significant enough to warrant further review. Adjusted scores reflect this moderate threat level, emphasizing caution."

      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of AES CBC encryption/decryption for client IP addresses. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent. The main issues are the non-standard padding method and lack of input validation, which are common in cryptographic code but do not indicate malicious activity."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily aimed at environment-aware network and request handling modifications, with no explicit malicious payloads. Its extensive patching and environment-dependent behavior introduce moderate security risks, particularly for traffic manipulation or covert request tracking. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.55, reflecting caution due to its capabilities rather than malicious intent."
