{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer that exposes the 'greet' function from the 'core' module for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statement from the module's __init__.py file.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks, as the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing 'greet' from '.core' during package initialization; no data flows beyond this import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement within a package's __init__.py, importing a function for public API exposure. It does not execute code, handle untrusted input, or perform network operations. The code's simplicity and lack of dynamic behavior indicate no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify this benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
