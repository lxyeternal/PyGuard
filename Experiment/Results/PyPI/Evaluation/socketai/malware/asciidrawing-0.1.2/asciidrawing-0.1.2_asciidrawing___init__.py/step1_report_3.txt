  "purpose": "This module initializes the asciidraw package by importing the greet function from the core module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'greet' from '.core'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing or external communication in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is minimal and standard for package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package __init__.py file, used to expose functions from submodules. It imports 'greet' from the 'core' module, which could potentially be used elsewhere in the package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward and contains no suspicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply imports a function for use in the package.",
