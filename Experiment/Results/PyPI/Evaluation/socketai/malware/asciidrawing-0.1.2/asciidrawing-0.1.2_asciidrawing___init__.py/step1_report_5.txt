  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "This is a standard __init__.py file that imports a function from the core module to make it available at package level. It contains no user input handling, data processing, or code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation are present. The code's simplicity and lack of dynamic or external data interactions suggest no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a package initializer with no malicious or security concern. It performs a straightforward import operation with no suspicious activity.",
