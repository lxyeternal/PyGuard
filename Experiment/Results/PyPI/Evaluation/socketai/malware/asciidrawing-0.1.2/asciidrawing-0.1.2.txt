      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits privacy-invasive behavior by sending environment info to an external server during installation, with a hardcoded webhook URL. While it does not contain active malware or obfuscation, the covert data transmission is suspicious and warrants caution. The malware score should be moderate, around 0.4, and the security risk should be elevated (~0.6) due to privacy concerns. The behavior is more indicative of privacy violation than outright malware, but it poses a security risk if misused."
