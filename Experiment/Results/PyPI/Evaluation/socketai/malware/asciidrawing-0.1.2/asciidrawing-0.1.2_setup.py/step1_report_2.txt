{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package named 'asciidrawing', including a custom post-installation script that sends data to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables (user's home directory), current datetime, and the requests library for HTTP POST.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post call sends data to an external URL (Discord webhook), which could be used maliciously to exfiltrate information.",
  "flows": "Data from os.path.expanduser('~') and datetime is embedded in a JSON payload sent via requests.post to the webhook URL during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is unusual and suspicious. The post-install hook sends system information (user home directory and timestamp) without user consent or notification. The import of requests is delayed until after installation, which is typical but combined with the webhook raises concern.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, during installation, sends a POST request to a specified Discord webhook, transmitting the user's home directory and the current timestamp. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which indicates potential malicious intent to exfiltrate system information or monitor installations. This behavior occurs automatically upon package installation without explicit user approval. The code does not contain obfuscation or malware-like actions such as executing reverse shells or damaging files. However, the use of a webhook to transmit environment data is suspicious and may violate user privacy. No other malicious code or backdoors are present. The overall behavior suggests an attempt to covertly gather and transmit system info via a popular communication platform, which could be used for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a suspicious hardcoded webhook URL and transmits system information during installation without user consent, indicating malicious intent or privacy violation. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack or malicious package designed for data exfiltration.",
