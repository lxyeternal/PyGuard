{
  "purpose": "The code installs a Python package and, during installation, sends system environment information (user's home directory) along with a timestamp to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, potentially for data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "sources": "The code reads the user's home directory via os.path.expanduser(\"~\") and the current timestamp via datetime.datetime.now().",
  "sinks": "The requests.post() function sends data to the hardcoded webhook URL, transmitting environment info externally.",
  "flows": "The source (environment info and timestamp) flows into the requests.post() call, which transmits the data to the external webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code unconditionally sends environment info during package installation without user consent, using a hardcoded webhook URL; no obfuscation or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, during installation, performs an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook, sending the user's home directory and timestamp. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads, but it performs covert data exfiltration without user awareness. The webhook URL is embedded directly, and the data transmission occurs automatically during install. This behavior raises privacy concerns and could be exploited for malicious tracking or data theft. The code does not contain destructive actions, backdoors, or code obfuscation, but the privacy-invasive behavior is suspicious. The malware score should reflect the potential for malicious use but not be overly high given the absence of active malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits privacy-invasive behavior by sending environment info to an external server during installation, with a hardcoded webhook URL. While it does not contain active malware or obfuscation, the covert data transmission is suspicious and warrants caution. The malware score should be moderate, around 0.4, and the security risk should be elevated (~0.6) due to privacy concerns. The behavior is more indicative of privacy violation than outright malware, but it poses a security risk if misused.",
