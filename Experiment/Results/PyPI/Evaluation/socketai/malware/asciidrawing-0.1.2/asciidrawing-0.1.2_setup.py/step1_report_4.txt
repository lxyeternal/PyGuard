{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, which includes a custom post-installation step that sends a webhook with system information.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (user's home directory), system time, and potentially untrusted input during the requests.post call (if the webhook URL or data were manipulated), but primarily it sources data from system info and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "The webhook URL (a Discord webhook) where data is sent; the 'requests.post' method transmits system info to an external server.",
  "flows": "Upon installation, the custom run method triggers '_post_install_action', which gathers system info and sends it via 'requests.post' to the webhook URL, creating a source-to-sink data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a webhook URL hardcoded into the script, which is unusual and potentially malicious if used to exfiltrate data or notify an attacker upon installation. The webhook is used immediately after installation without user consent, and the information sent is limited but could be exploited for tracking.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup process with a custom install command that, after installation, sends a POST request to a specified Discord webhook URL containing the user's home directory and current timestamp. This behavior resembles a tracking or exfiltration mechanism. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which is suspicious. The code does not sanitize or verify the data sent. The use of 'requests' is standard, but the purpose of the webhook is questionable, as it could be used to inform an attacker of package installation or gather system info surreptitiously. There are no obfuscated code patterns or attempts to hide behavior, but the intentional sending of system info to a remote server immediately after install is a significant concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a malicious-like behavior by sending system information to an external webhook upon package installation, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration. The hardcoded webhook URL and automated request post-installation are suspicious and could indicate malicious intent or privacy violation.",
