{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom post-installation hook to send data via a webhook.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables (os.path.expanduser(\"~\")), current datetime (datetime.datetime.now()), and package installation data.",
  "sinks": "The code sends an HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL with embedded JSON data containing system info.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variable and datetime -> embed object -> data dictionary -> requests.post to webhook URL (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The webhook URL is hardcoded in the code, which is suspicious. The code sends system information (home directory path and timestamp) unconditionally during installation. No user input validation or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code installs a package named 'asciidrawing' and sets up a custom install command that, during installation, sends a POST request to a Discord webhook containing the user's home directory path and current timestamp. The webhook URL is embedded directly in the code, indicating hardcoded secret data. The code does not perform any malicious activity like data theft, system modification, or backdoor installation, but the act of sending environment info to an external server during install is unusual and potentially privacy-invasive. The webhook URL suggests possible malicious intent if used maliciously, but without further malicious code or data exfiltration, this appears to be an unusual but not overtly malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script includes a suspicious behavior of reporting system info to an external webhook during package installation, with a hardcoded webhook URL. While it does not contain clear malware, this behavior could be used maliciously for data collection without user consent, raising security and privacy concerns.",
