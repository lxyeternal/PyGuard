{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the 'asciidrawing' Python package, which installs the package and defines a custom post-installation action that sends data to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the environment variable (user's home directory) via os.path.expanduser(\"~\"), and the current date and time via datetime.datetime.now().",
  "sinks": "The requests.post call sends data to a Discord webhook URL, transmitting the user's home directory path and installation timestamp.",
  "flows": "The code reads environment data and current timestamp (sources) and then sends this data over the network to the specified webhook URL (sink) during post-installation.",
  "anomalies": "The webhook URL is hardcoded and publicly visible within the code, which could be malicious if used for data exfiltration or unauthorized notifications. The code sends environment and timestamp data without user consent. No validation or encryption of the data is performed. The request is executed automatically during package installation, which could be misused to leak system information.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation command that, upon execution, attempts to send a POST request containing the user's home directory path and the current timestamp to a Discord webhook URL. The URL is hardcoded and visible in the code, indicating potential malicious intent or malicious usage. The data sent is sensitive (user's home directory). The request is made during package installation without user awareness or consent, which is suspicious behavior. The code leverages 'requests' for network communication, loaded only after installation dependencies are installed. Overall, the code behaves maliciously by exfiltrating environment data to an external server during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes malicious behavior by sending environment information to an external webhook during package installation. The hardcoded webhook URL and automatic data transmission without user consent suggest malicious intent. This setup script is potentially harmful and should not be trusted.",
