  "purpose": "Generate ASCII art representations of input text using a predefined font dictionary.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter to generate_ascii_art function; static ascii_font dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Return value of generate_ascii_art, which outputs ASCII art as a string; print statement in greet() function.",
  "flows": "Input string -> convert to uppercase -> character lookup in ascii_font -> assemble lines -> join and return as string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is static, straightforward, with no hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple ASCII art generator with a static font dictionary. It processes input text by converting it to uppercase, then constructs ASCII art line-by-line for each character, appending spaces between characters. The function does not perform any external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The only potential minor concern is that unsupported characters are silently ignored, but this does not impact security. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no security risks or malware. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low or zero security risk. Slight adjustments could be made to set the security risk score to 0.0 across all reports, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign ASCII art generator with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The existing reports are accurate; minor score adjustments to reflect zero security risk are recommended. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward.",
