  "purpose": "Generate ASCII art representations of input text using a predefined font mapping.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'text' in generate_ascii_art function.",
  "sinks": "The generated ASCII art string returned by generate_ascii_art.",
  "flows": "Input text is processed in generate_ascii_art, which maps characters to ASCII representations and constructs the ASCII art output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No use of unsafe functions, code injection, or external network calls. The function is straightforward and limited to string processing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a font mapping for ASCII characters and a function to generate ASCII art based on input text. It converts the input text to uppercase, iterates over each character, and constructs a multi-line ASCII representation. The greet() function simply prints the ASCII art for the word 'Greetings'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks. The code is static and does not interact with external systems or sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs straightforward ASCII art generation, and contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
