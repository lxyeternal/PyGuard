{
  "purpose": "This code generates ASCII art for input text using a predefined font mapping and provides a greeting function that displays the word 'Greetings' in ASCII art.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text in the function 'generate_ascii_art' and the hardcoded 'ascii_font' dictionary containing character patterns.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that process untrusted data in a way that affects system security or leaks information. The output is printed to standard output.",
  "flows": "Input text is received by 'generate_ascii_art', which reads from the 'ascii_font' dictionary, processes each character, and constructs ASCII art lines to be displayed. The 'greet' function calls 'generate_ascii_art' with a fixed string and prints the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code only performs ASCII art generation and standard printing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static ASCII font dictionary mapping characters to patterns. The 'generate_ascii_art' function converts input text to uppercase, iterates over each character, and concatenates ASCII patterns line by line, adding spacing. The 'greet' function simply prints the ASCII art for the string 'Greetings'. There are no external inputs, network activity, or suspicious code constructs. The code appears to be purely for ASCII art generation with no malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and intended for ASCII art display. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It operates solely on predefined data and standard output, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
