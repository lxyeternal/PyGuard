{
  "purpose": "The code generates ASCII art representations of input text using a predefined font and provides a greeting function that prints 'Greetings' in ASCII art.",
  "sources": "The function generate_ascii_art reads input text and processes each character based on the ascii_font dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The code prints output to the console in the greet function. No external data sinks or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "Input text is converted to uppercase (source), then each character's ASCII representation is appended to output lines (sink), resulting in printed ASCII art.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The ascii_font dictionary is static and used solely for visual representation.",
  "analysis": "The code converts input text to uppercase, then constructs ASCII art line-by-line based on a predefined font. The generate_ascii_art function builds the ASCII art in memory and returns it as a string, which is printed in the greet function. There are no external inputs other than the text parameter, no dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward and benign, serving a purely visual purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign ASCII art generator with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not handle untrusted data in a way that would pose security concerns, nor does it contain malicious payloads or backdoors.",
