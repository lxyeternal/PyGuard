  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, which could be used for malicious payload delivery or backdoor installation. The use of obfuscation, stealth, and error suppression warrants a high malware and security risk score."
