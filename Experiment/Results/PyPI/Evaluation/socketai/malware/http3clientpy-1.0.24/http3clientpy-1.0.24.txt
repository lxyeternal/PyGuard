      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, containing only import statements with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but does not constitute malicious behavior. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0. The risk score remains low due to poor practice but not security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code pattern demonstrates high-risk malicious behavior through remote code fetching and execution without validation. All reports accurately identify this pattern, and their scores are appropriate. The code should be considered highly suspicious and potentially malicious, warranting caution and further review."
