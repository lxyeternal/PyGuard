  "purpose": "Dynamically fetches and executes code from a remote server, potentially for malicious remote code execution.",
  "sources": "requests.get() fetches data from a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "exec() executes the decoded code, which can run arbitrary code on the system.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves code from the URL -> base64.b64decode() decodes the fetched content -> exec() executes the decoded code.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic code execution via exec() on content fetched from an external URL; the code is encoded with base64, which is often used to obfuscate malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code imports threading, requests, and base64 modules. It defines a main() function that attempts to fetch code from a remote server via an HTTP GET request. The fetched response text is encoded and then base64-decoded before being executed with exec(). The execution is wrapped in a try-except block to handle KeyboardInterrupt gracefully and print any other exceptions. The main() function runs in a separate thread. The use of external URL fetching combined with dynamic execution and obfuscation suggests malicious intent, as this pattern is commonly used to hide payloads or malicious scripts. The code does not validate or sanitize fetched content, which poses significant security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This script is highly suspicious due to its use of dynamic code fetching, base64 obfuscation, and execution of external code. It is likely malicious, potentially serving as a remote code execution backdoor or payload delivery mechanism.",
