  "purpose": "Fetches remote code via HTTP, decodes it from base64, and executes it dynamically.",
  "sources": "requests.get() to retrieve code from URL; response.text for content",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decoded code",
  "flows": "requests.get() -> base64.b64decode() -> exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for code obfuscation; remote code execution without validation; running in a separate thread",
  "analysis": "The code fetches code from a remote URL, decodes it from base64, and executes it via exec() within a thread. No validation or sanitization is performed, which is a significant security concern. The pattern is characteristic of malicious scripts or backdoors. The use of base64 adds a mild obfuscation layer. All reports correctly identify this pattern as suspicious and potentially malicious. The high malware score (0.9), obfuscation score (0.8), and security risk score (0.9) are justified given the behavior. The code's pattern aligns with common malicious activity, such as remote code execution and obfuscation techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern demonstrates high-risk malicious behavior through remote code fetching and execution without validation. All reports accurately identify this pattern, and their scores are appropriate. The code should be considered highly suspicious and potentially malicious, warranting caution and further review.",
