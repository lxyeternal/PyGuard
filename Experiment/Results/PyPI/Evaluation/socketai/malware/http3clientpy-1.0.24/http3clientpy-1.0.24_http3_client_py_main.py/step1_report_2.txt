  "purpose": "Dynamically fetches and executes code from an external URL after decoding from base64.",
  "sources": "requests.get() call to retrieve code from 'https://pettish-morning.000webhostapp.com/code.php'.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing the decoded code, which can run arbitrary code with full privileges.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves code -> base64.b64decode() decodes it -> exec() executes the code.",
  "anomalies": "Code executes external data directly via exec() without validation; dynamic code execution from remote source is suspicious. No input validation or sandboxing.",
  "analysis": "The script runs in a separate thread. It retrieves code from a remote server over HTTP, decodes it from base64, and executes it directly. This pattern is typical for malicious payload delivery or remote command execution. The use of exec() with remote content is highly risky, as it can execute arbitrary malicious code. The exception handling suppresses KeyboardInterrupts and logs other errors, but does not prevent malicious activity. No other suspicious behaviors are evident in this fragment. Overall, the code is designed to execute external, possibly malicious, code dynamically, which constitutes a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code fetches and executes remote code dynamically, representing a high security threat due to the potential for malicious payload execution. The pattern suggests malicious intent or a backdoor. The use of remote code execution without validation is dangerous and should be considered malicious.",
