  "purpose": "Dynamically fetches and executes remote code at runtime",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to 'https://pettish-morning.000webhostapp.com/code.php'",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decoded code, which could be malicious",
  "flows": "requests.get() fetches code -> base64.b64decode() decodes it -> exec() executes it",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic code execution via exec() with code fetched over the network; lack of validation or verification; decoding from base64; running in a separate thread without logging or restrictions",
  "analysis": "The code imports threading, requests, and base64 modules. It defines a main() function that tries to fetch code from a specified URL, decodes it from base64, and executes it dynamically with exec(). If an exception occurs, it prints the error, except for KeyboardInterrupt. The main() function is started in a new thread. This pattern is characteristic of obfuscated or malicious code, as it downloads and runs arbitrary code from a remote source without validation, which poses significant security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code dynamically executes code fetched from an external server without validation, indicating high potential for malicious behavior. It resembles a backdoor or remote code execution mechanism. Overall, the code should be considered malicious or highly suspicious.",
