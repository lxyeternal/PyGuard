  "purpose": "Manage package versioning by reading, incrementing, and writing a version number in a local file during setup.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'version' file; writing to 'version' file",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; local file operations only",
  "flows": "Read 'version' -> increment -> write back -> use in setup()",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling (`except:`) masking all errors; no validation of file content",
  "analysis": "The code reads a version number from a local file, defaults to 1 if reading fails, increments it, and writes it back. It then uses this version in the setup() call. No external network activity or malicious code is present. The broad exception handling could hide errors but is not malicious. No obfuscation or secrets are involved. The version file could be manipulated externally, but this does not constitute malicious activity. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version management script with no malicious intent. The only minor concern is broad exception handling which could mask errors, but it does not pose a security threat.",
