  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code snippets and their implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports are based solely on import statements: `from requests import *` and `import .main`.\n- No actual code execution, data handling, network requests, or malicious payloads are shown.\n- The main concern raised is the use of `import *` from `requests`, which is a bad practice but not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior is present in these snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues in the code:\n- The code snippets are minimal and only contain import statements. No malicious activity can be confirmed from these lines alone.\n- The use of `from requests import *` can lead to namespace pollution, which might hide malicious functions if they were present, but in this context, there's no such activity.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is only import statements and does not perform any malicious actions.\n- They note the poor practice of using `import *`, which is valid.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n- They appropriately refrain from assigning high malware or security risk scores, given the minimal code.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the code.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the poor practice but not malicious intent.\n- Confidence levels vary but are generally reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are demonstrated, risk scores should remain low.\n- The only concern is the use of `import *`, which can be problematic but is not malicious.\n\n### Malware scores:\n- Correctly assigned as 0 across all reports, since no malicious activity is evident.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming vulnerabilities based solely on import statements.\n- No unwarranted claims about potential exploits are made.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- Scores are consistent with the minimal code and cautious analysis.\n- The confidence levels reflect the limited information.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven all the above, I concur with the reports' evaluations. The code snippets are benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (poor practice but not risky in isolation)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\nThese snippets are just import statements with no malicious or security concerns. The use of `import *` is discouraged but not malicious. No further action is needed unless more code reveals actual behavior.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Confirmed no malicious code.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n- No adjustments necessary.",
