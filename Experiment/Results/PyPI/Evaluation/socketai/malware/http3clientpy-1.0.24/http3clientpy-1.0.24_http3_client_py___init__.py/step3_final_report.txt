{
  "purpose": "This code imports all functions from the 'requests' library and imports a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the import statements, but no actual data or user input is processed within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only contains import statements without execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from requests import *' is a poor practice due to namespace pollution, but it is not malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, with no executable logic, network requests, or data processing shown. The import style is discouraged but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The minimal code indicates a benign intent, with the main concern being poor coding practice rather than security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, containing only import statements with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but does not constitute malicious behavior. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0. The risk score remains low due to poor practice but not security threat.",
