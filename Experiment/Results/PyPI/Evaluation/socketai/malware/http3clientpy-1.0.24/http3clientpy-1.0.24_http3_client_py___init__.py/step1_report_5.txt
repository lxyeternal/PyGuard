  "purpose": "Import all functions from the 'requests' library and import the 'main' module from the current package.",
  "sources": "Requests library functions (from requests import *)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this snippet; potential for data flow depends on subsequent code using imported functions and modules.",
  "flows": "Potential flow would be from the imported 'requests' functions or 'main' module to any subsequent processing, but no specific flow is shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from requests import *' is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but not inherently malicious. No other anomalies are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all functions from the 'requests' library, which is commonly used for HTTP requests, and imports a local module 'main'. There are no explicit data reads, writes, or execution of code that could indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal and does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Since this is only an import statement snippet, it lacks context about how these imports are used.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic imports without any signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The use of wildcard import from 'requests' is not best practice but is not malicious. Overall, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
