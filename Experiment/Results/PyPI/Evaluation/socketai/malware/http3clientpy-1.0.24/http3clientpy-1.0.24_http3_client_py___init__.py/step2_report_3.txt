  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and whether the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Only import statements; no actual code or malicious activity observed.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.4.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report correctly notes that only import statements are present.\n- The use of `from requests import *` is discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n- The low security risk score seems appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on import practices.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.7.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Again, only import statements, with no actual code or suspicious activity.\n- Slightly higher confidence score, which is acceptable given the emphasis on poor practice.\n- No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—imports only, with note on namespace pollution.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correctly identifies the poor practice but no malicious activity.\n- Slightly higher confidence, justified by the mention of potential issues with import style.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar import pattern; potential for network activity if functions are called later.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.7.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No actual network activity or malicious code shown.\n- The potential for misuse is acknowledged but not evidenced here.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others; import statements only.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1, confidence = 0.7.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Minimal code, no malicious activity.\n- Slightly lower security risk score aligns with the minimal code.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code only contains import statements with no active malicious behavior.\n- The use of `from requests import *` is consistently flagged as poor practice but not malicious.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal and benign nature of the code snippets.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nBased on the provided reports and analysis, I agree with the assigned scores. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk in these snippets. The main concern is the poor practice of wildcard imports, which is noted but not malicious.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2, consistent with the reports.\n- **Confidence:** Ranges from 0.4 to 0.8, depending on the report.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n> The code snippets are benign import statements with no malicious intent or activity. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
