  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, focusing on the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom requests import *\nfrom . import main\n```\n\n**1. Presence of Reported Issues in the Code:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code only contains import statements, with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity shown.\n- The use of `from requests import *` is consistently flagged as poor practice due to namespace pollution, but none of the reports suggest malicious intent or actual malicious activity.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n\n- The reports generally avoid overinterpreting the minimal code. They correctly note that no malicious behavior is evident.\n- However, they sometimes mention \"potential\" or \"possible\" risks associated with the import style without concrete evidence. This is appropriate given the limited context.\n- The reports do not mention that, while `from requests import *` is discouraged, it is not inherently malicious or dangerous in itself.\n\n**3. Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable since the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern. This seems appropriate considering only import statements are present, with no evident malicious activity.\n\n**4. Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n\n- A risk score higher than 0.5 would imply significant concern, such as active malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors, none of which are present here.\n- The only concern is the use of `import *`, which can lead to namespace pollution and obscure function origins, but it is not a security risk per se.\n\n**5. Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n\n- Since no malicious activity or obfuscation is present, the scores of 0 are justified.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n\n- The reports appropriately avoid assuming malicious intent solely based on import style.\n- They acknowledge that without further code, no malicious activity can be inferred.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the minimal code and the analysis provided.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0.2** (due to poor practice, but not malicious)\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code snippet is benign; it only performs imports.\n- The use of `from requests import *` is discouraged but not malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk beyond coding style concerns.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed to the scores; the current assessment aligns well with the evidence.",
