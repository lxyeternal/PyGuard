{
  "purpose": "The code imports the entire 'requests' library and a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "Imports requests module and local main module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this snippet, as it only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from requests import *' is a potential anomaly, as it imports all names into the namespace, which can lead to unclear or conflicting identifiers. The local import '.main' indicates a relative import, but without additional context, it is not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, which by themselves do not perform any malicious actions. Importing 'requests' with '*' can be considered a bad practice but not malicious. The presence of a relative import suggests modular code, but no other behavior is observable. No input reading, data processing, or network activity occurs in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal import statement code fragment with no evidence of malicious behavior. The use of 'from requests import *' is considered poor practice but not malicious. No security risks are apparent from this snippet alone.",
