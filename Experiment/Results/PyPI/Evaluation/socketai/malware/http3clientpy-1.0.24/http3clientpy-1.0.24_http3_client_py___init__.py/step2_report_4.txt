  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code snippets.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports involve only import statements: `from requests import *` and `import main` or `.main`.\n- No executable code, data handling, network requests, or malicious payloads are shown.\n- The main concern raised across reports is the use of `import *` from the `requests` library, which is considered poor practice due to namespace pollution but not inherently malicious.\n- All reports assign low confidence scores (mostly between 0.4 and 0.8), with malware scores at 0, indicating no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Issue Presence\n- **Code correctness:** The code snippets are syntactically correct and do not contain errors.\n- **Malicious activity:** There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or payloads.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are explicitly demonstrated; the only concern is the import style, which can lead to maintenance or clarity issues but not security risks per se.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in Reports\n- The reports correctly identify the risk associated with `import *` but sometimes overstate it as a security risk, whereas it's primarily a code quality concern.\n- The reasoning that the code could be malicious based solely on import statements is unfounded; no assumptions about unshown code are justified.\n- The reports appropriately note the lack of actual usage or network activity.\n\n### Score Justifications\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is reasonable; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Low scores (0.1 to 0.2) are justified, as the only concern is poor import practices, not active threats.\n\n### Recommendations for Score Adjustments\n- The scores seem consistent with the evidence. No significant adjustments are necessary.\n- The confidence scores could be slightly increased (e.g., from 0.4 to 0.5 or 0.6) in some reports, given the commonality of such import patterns, but given the minimal code, the current scores are acceptable.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- Since no actual malicious or suspicious activity is demonstrated, any higher malware or risk scores would be unjustified.\n- The use of `import *` from `requests` should be flagged as a poor practice but not as a security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary and Personal Estimation\n**Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (minor concern due to poor import practice, but not security-related)\n\n**Overall, the code snippets are benign.** The primary concern is style, not security.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the provided reports and code snippets, I agree with the assigned scores. No evidence suggests malware or malicious intent. The minimal code and lack of activity mean the risk remains very low. The main recommendation is to avoid `import *` for clarity and maintainability, but it does not elevate security concerns.",
