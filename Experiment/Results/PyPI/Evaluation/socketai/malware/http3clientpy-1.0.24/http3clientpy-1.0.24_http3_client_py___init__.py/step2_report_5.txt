  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the claims with the provided code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom requests import *\nfrom . import main\n```\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code only contains import statements with no executable logic.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, data leaks, or backdoors is present in this minimal snippet.\n- The use of `from requests import *` is flagged as a bad practice due to namespace pollution, but not inherently malicious.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n\n- The reports generally acknowledge that the code is minimal and lacks malicious indicators.\n- Some reports suggest that the broad import could be suspicious, but this is an overstatement; it's a coding style concern rather than a security flaw.\n- No report mentions the absence of any actual network requests or data handling, which is accurate.\n\n**3. Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the lack of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), which seems appropriate given the minimal code.\n- Confidence levels are moderate to high (0.7 to 0.8), reflecting the understanding that this is just an import snippet.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n\n- Since there is no evidence of malicious activity, malware scores should remain at 0.\n- The security risk is low because the code could be misused if the imported functions are later invoked with malicious inputs, but as it stands, the risk is minimal.\n\n**5. Malware Score Considerations:**\n\n- The code does not perform any network requests, data exfiltration, or code execution.\n- The import of `requests` does not imply malicious intent; it’s a common library.\n- Therefore, malware scores should be zero.\n\n**6. Assumptions about Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming vulnerabilities solely based on import statements.\n- No assumptions about unshown code are made, which is appropriate.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: malware = 0, low security risk, and moderate confidence.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** **0.1** (minimal, due to poor practice of wildcard import but not malicious)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code snippet is benign. The reports correctly identify the minimal nature of the code and the lack of malicious indicators. The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If future code shows actual usage of these imports, network activity, or data handling, reassessment would be necessary.",
