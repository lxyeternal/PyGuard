      "conclusion": "The script's core malicious indicator is the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup, executed silently and with error suppression. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity, warranting caution and further investigation. The high obfuscation and stealth suggest intent to conceal malicious payloads, making this package a significant security risk."
