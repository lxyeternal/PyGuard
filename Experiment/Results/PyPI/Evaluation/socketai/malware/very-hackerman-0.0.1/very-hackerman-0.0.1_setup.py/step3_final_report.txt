{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform malicious activities, including sending data to an external webhook and executing obfuscated code, likely for backdoor or data exfiltration purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'README.md' for description; the primary malicious source is the initial import and execution block, which includes the requests.post() call and the exec() of decoded payload.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post() sends data to an external URL; the exec() executes decoded code, which may perform further malicious actions such as system manipulation or data theft.",
  "flows": "Input data (if any) is not explicitly read; however, the flow involves the code executing a network request and then executing obfuscated code, which may perform additional malicious operations.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL with offensive message, use of broad try-except to suppress errors, heavily obfuscated base64 payload executed via exec(), and the immediate network communication upon import.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with an import of setuptools, then attempts to import requests and performs a POST request to a suspicious webhook with the message 'niger'. It then executes a base64-decoded payload via exec(), which is heavily obfuscated, indicating malicious intent. The code reads 'README.md' normally, which is benign. The setup configuration appears legitimate but is likely a facade. The network activity and obfuscated code strongly suggest a backdoor or data exfiltration mechanism. The broad exception handling may hide failures. Dependencies are standard but are used maliciously here. The overall behavior is consistent with a supply chain attack or malicious backdoor embedded in a package. The malicious activities include covert communication, code obfuscation, and dynamic execution, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through network communication to a suspicious webhook and execution of heavily obfuscated code. The package setup is a cover for these activities. The scores assigned in the reports (close to 1.0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk) are justified. This package should be considered malicious and avoided for use or distribution.",
