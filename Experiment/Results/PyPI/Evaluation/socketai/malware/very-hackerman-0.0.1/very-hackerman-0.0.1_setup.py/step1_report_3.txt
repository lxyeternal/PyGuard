  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'very-hackerman', including dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads a remote webhook URL and executes dynamically decoded code; reads README.md file; imports packages.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post call sends data to a Discord webhook; exec executes decoded base64 code, which may perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "requests.post('webhook URL') -> exec(decoded malicious code)",
  "anomalies": "The code makes an immediate POST request to a Discord webhook with a suspicious message. It executes obfuscated base64-decoded code, which could be malicious. No validation or sanitization of data, and the code is highly obfuscated. The setup process itself appears normal, but the embedded malicious behavior is hidden in the exec statement.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup, which is standard. However, it then attempts to import 'requests' and immediately sends a POST request to a Discord webhook with a message ('niger'), which is suspicious and potentially malicious. Following that, it executes a large, obfuscated base64-encoded string, decoded and run via exec. This decoded code is highly suspicious because it is obfuscated and likely performs malicious actions such as data exfiltration or backdoor installation. The code then reads 'README.md' for long description and proceeds with normal package setup, including dependencies and metadata, which is standard for a malicious script trying to hide its true intent. The use of dynamic code execution and external network communication at import time strongly indicates malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior hidden within an obfuscated exec statement and an immediate request to a Discord webhook with a suspicious message. These are clear indicators of malicious intent, likely for data exfiltration or control. The setup part is normal, but the embedded code and network activity are highly suspicious and dangerous.",
