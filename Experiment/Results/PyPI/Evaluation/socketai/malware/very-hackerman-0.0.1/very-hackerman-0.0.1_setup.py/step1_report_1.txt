{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'very-hackerman' with specified metadata, dependencies, and description.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'README.md' file; it imports 'requests' and 'setuptools'; it reads environment variables and package information.",
  "sinks": "The code performs an HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL, executing dynamically decoded and encoded code via exec; the decoded code likely contains malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'requests' and posts data to an external URL, then executes dynamically decoded code, which may lead to malicious activities such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoor installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a hardcoded Discord webhook URL used to send data; it executes base64-decoded and obfuscated code via exec(), which is highly suspicious; the code attempts to import 'requests' and performs an HTTP request without any clear legitimate purpose; the overall structure suggests hidden malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "Initial setup appears typical for a Python package with metadata and dependencies. However, at the very start, it tries to import 'requests' and immediately sends a POST request with the content 'niger' to a Discord webhook, which is suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. The code then attempts to execute dynamically decoded base64-encoded code via exec(), which is obfuscated and commonly used to conceal malicious payloads. The encoded code likely contains further malicious actions such as data theft, system compromise, or remote control. The package metadata and dependency list are standard and do not raise alarms, but the embedded webhook and dynamic code execution are significant red flags. The code reads 'README.md' normally, but the initial malicious code overshadows this. Overall, the script contains malicious behaviors masked under legitimate package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent, primarily due to the hardcoded webhook URL, the immediate attempt to send data to an external server, and the obfuscated dynamic code execution. These actions are indicative of a supply chain attack or backdoor implant within a seemingly legitimate package setup script. The package should be considered dangerous and should not be used.",
