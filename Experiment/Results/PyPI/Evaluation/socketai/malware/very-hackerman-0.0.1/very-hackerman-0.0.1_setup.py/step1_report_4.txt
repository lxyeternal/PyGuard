    "Base64 payload appears to decode into further potentially malicious or obfuscated code",
    "Code does not handle exceptions explicitly in a way that logs or alerts errors",
    "Potentially malicious code is embedded and executed at runtime without transparency"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script begins with an import of 'requests' and performs an unsolicited POST request to a Discord webhook with an offensive message, indicating malicious or disruptive intent. Then, it attempts to execute obfuscated code encoded in base64, which upon decoding could perform further malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or other harmful behaviors. The presence of such obfuscated execution combined with the immediate network communication strongly suggests malicious intent. The rest of the code involves normal package setup procedures, reading a README file, and defining package metadata and dependencies, which appear benign. However, the initial code execution pattern is suspicious and likely malicious, overshadowing the benign package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior in the form of an immediate network request to a webhook and the execution of obfuscated code, likely used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or system compromise. The package setup appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the malicious payload execution at runtime.",
