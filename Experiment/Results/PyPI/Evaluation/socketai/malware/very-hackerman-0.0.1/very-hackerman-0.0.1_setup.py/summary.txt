  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through network communication to a suspicious webhook and execution of heavily obfuscated code. The package setup is a cover for these activities. The scores assigned in the reports (close to 1.0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk) are justified. This package should be considered malicious and avoided for use or distribution."
