{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'very-hackerman' with specified metadata and dependencies, and perform an initial attempt to send data to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "The code reads a remote URL for a webhook, reads a local README.md file for description, and imports dependencies such as requests, base64, and pycryptodome.",
  "sinks": "The code sends a POST request to a Discord webhook URL with a fixed content. It executes dynamically decoded base64 code which could lead to malicious activity. It also reads local files (README.md).",
  "flows": "The script attempts to send data to an external URL immediately upon import. It then executes dynamically decoded code, which may contain further malicious actions. Data from README.md is used for description but no untrusted input is evident in that part.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an HTTP POST to a Discord webhook with a potentially offensive message ('niger'). It dynamically executes code decoded from base64 without any verification, which is suspicious. The 'exec' statement contains obfuscated code execution, indicating potential malicious intent. The code does not use the imported modules directly in the visible snippet except for the initial request and dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by attempting to import 'requests' and then immediately makes a POST request to a Discord webhook with a fixed, offensive message. It then executes code decoded from a base64 string, which is a major red flag for malicious activity. The base64-decoded code appears to be a complex, obfuscated script, potentially a backdoor or malicious payload. The setup configuration appears normal, with no apparent malicious dependencies or configurations. The use of dynamic code execution and unsolicited network activity are high security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through unsolicited external communication and dynamic code execution of obfuscated payload. The initial POST request with a provocative message suggests malicious intent. Overall, this package appears malicious and should not be used.",
