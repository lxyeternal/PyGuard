{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration, including metadata and dependencies, for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads a README.md file for long_description; it imports modules such as requests, base64, setuptools, and pycryptodome; it also reads package dependencies and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post call with a webhook URL and payload 'niger'; the exec with base64-encoded code that decodes and executes malicious-looking Python code.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves an initial attempt to send data to a remote webhook, followed by executing decoded base64 code which appears to be obfuscated and potentially malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an immediate POST request to a Discord webhook with a suspicious payload; execution of dynamically decoded base64 code; the base64 string decodes to code that appears to execute further potentially malicious operations; use of try-except that suppresses errors, which can hide malicious activity; no comments or legitimate indications of malicious intent, but suspicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by attempting to send a POST request containing the string 'niger' to a Discord webhook, which could be used for covert communication or exfiltration. Then, it executes a large block of base64-decoded code, which is intentionally obfuscated; decoding reveals it likely executes further malicious commands, possibly backdoors or data exfiltration routines. The setup configuration is standard and harmless, but the initial request and exec suggest malicious intent. The try-except block suppresses errors, potentially hiding failures of malicious payload execution. The package dependencies include 'requests', 'base64', and 'pycryptodome', which are common and do not inherently indicate malicious activity, but their presence alongside malicious code is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, notably the attempt to send data to an external webhook and the execution of obfuscated code that likely performs malicious actions. The setup portion appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the malicious payload. The overall security risk is high due to the embedded malicious code and covert communication attempts.",
