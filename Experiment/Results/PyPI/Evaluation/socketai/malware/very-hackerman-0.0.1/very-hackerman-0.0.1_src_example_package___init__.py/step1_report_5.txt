{
  "purpose": "The code appears to decode a base64-encoded string and execute it dynamically, likely to run hidden or obfuscated code.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded via b64decode, then executed with exec().",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decoded code, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if the decoded content is malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the base64-encoded string through b64decode() into exec(), creating a direct source-to-sink path.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on decoded data, combined with base64 decoding, strongly indicates obfuscation. The decoded string could contain malicious commands. The code is highly obfuscated and designed to hide the true intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports base64, decodes a long base64 string, and executes the result via exec(). The base64 string likely contains additional code that could perform malicious activities such as network requests, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation and dynamic execution are classic indicators of malicious or suspicious behavior, especially since the actual payload is hidden until runtime. No other third-party libraries are involved, and the code doesn't read external inputs directly, but the use of exec() on decoded content is a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, designed to hide its true functionality through obfuscation and dynamic execution. It could execute arbitrary malicious code on the host system. This pattern is common in malware or backdoors.",
