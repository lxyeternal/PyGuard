      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through network communication to a suspicious webhook and execution of heavily obfuscated code. The package setup is a cover for these activities. The scores assigned in the reports (close to 1.0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk) are justified. This package should be considered malicious and avoided for use or distribution."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits classic malicious obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns, indicating high likelihood of malware. All reports correctly identify the suspicious pattern, and the scores are justified. The pattern should be flagged as high severity, and further analysis of the decoded payload is recommended if possible. The overall assessment confirms this is malicious code with maximum security risk."
