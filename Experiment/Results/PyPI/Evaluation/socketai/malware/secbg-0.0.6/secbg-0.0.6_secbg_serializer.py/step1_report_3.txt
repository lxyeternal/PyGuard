  "purpose": "The code provides serialization functions to convert Django model instances and querysets into dictionaries, with optional protobuf deserialization.",
  "sources": "model_to_dict(obj), obj.ext_info_proto()",
  "sinks": "pb_to_dict(), data[extinfo_key]",
  "flows": "model_to_dict -> pb_to_dict (if with_extinfo) -> data[extinfo_key]",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No use of untrusted input sources or insecure data handling. No suspicious network activity or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The functions serialize Django models and querysets into dictionaries, with optional protobuf deserialization. The use of model_to_dict, pb_to_dict, and log (though unused) are standard and benign. The code does not handle untrusted input directly, nor does it contain code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign serialization utility for Django models with protobuf support. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
