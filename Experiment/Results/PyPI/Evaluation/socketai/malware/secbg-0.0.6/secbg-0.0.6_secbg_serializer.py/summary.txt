  "conclusion": "The code is a benign serialization utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk stems from optional protobuf deserialization, which is standard practice and not inherently dangerous here. Scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and a very low security risk."
