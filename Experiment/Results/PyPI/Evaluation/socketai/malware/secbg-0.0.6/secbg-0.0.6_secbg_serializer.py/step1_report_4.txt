  "purpose": "The code provides serialization functions for Django model objects and querysets, converting them into dictionaries, with optional deserialization of protobuf data.",
  "sources": "model_to_dict(obj), obj.ext_info_proto()",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified, no data output or external data transmission shown",
  "flows": "model_to_dict reads model data; pb_to_dict deserializes protobuf; serialize_queryset iterates over queryset and calls serialize for each object",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious patterns detected; usage of common serialization functions is typical",
  "analysis": "The functions perform standard data serialization for Django models, with optional protobuf deserialization. No data leaks, external network communication, or malicious code execution present. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies observed; the code appears legitimate and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard serialization logic for Django models with protobuf support. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified. The code is safe.",
