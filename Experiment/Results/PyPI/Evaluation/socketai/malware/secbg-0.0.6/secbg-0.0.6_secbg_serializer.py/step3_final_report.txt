  "flows": "model_to_dict -> data, obj.ext_info_proto() -> pb_to_dict",
  "anomalies": "Optional protobuf deserialization; no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward serialization of Django models and querysets, optionally deserializing protobuf extension info. It relies on trusted external functions and does not process untrusted input directly. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident. The optional protobuf deserialization introduces minimal risk if data is untrusted, but no evidence suggests misuse. The code is clean, purpose-specific, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign serialization utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk stems from optional protobuf deserialization, which is standard practice and not inherently dangerous here. Scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and a very low security risk.",
