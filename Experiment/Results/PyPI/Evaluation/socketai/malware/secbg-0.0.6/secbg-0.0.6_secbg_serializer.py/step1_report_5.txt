{
  "purpose": "The code serializes Django model objects and querysets into dictionaries, with optional deserialization of protobuf extensions.",
  "sources": "Reads data from Django model objects (`model_to_dict`), protobuf objects (`pb_to_dict`), and model's `ext_info_proto()` method.",
  "sinks": "Data is transformed and returned as dictionaries or lists; no external sinks such as network, file, or environment variables are directly involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model objects and protobuf methods into dictionaries, optionally including extended info, then into lists of dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code primarily performs data serialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions for model serialization, protobuf conversion, and logging. It defines two functions: 'serialize' and 'serialize_queryset'. The 'serialize' function converts a Django model object into a dictionary, optionally adding deserialized protobuf extension info. The 'serialize_queryset' function applies 'serialize' across a queryset. No dynamic code execution, external data injection, or suspicious patterns are present. The functions rely on external, presumably safe, imported utilities. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware. The code appears to be straightforward serialization logic with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard serialization utility for Django models with protobuf extensions. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It performs safe data transformations with no suspicious anomalies.",
