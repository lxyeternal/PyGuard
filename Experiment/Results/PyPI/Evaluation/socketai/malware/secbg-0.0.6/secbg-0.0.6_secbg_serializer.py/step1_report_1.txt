  "purpose": "Serialize Django model objects and querysets into dictionaries, with optional deserialization of protobuf data.",
  "sources": "model_to_dict, pb_to_dict, obj.ext_info_proto()",
  "sinks": "pb_to_dict (deserialization), data manipulation",
  "flows": "model_to_dict -> serialize -> pb_to_dict (if with_extinfo) -> data assignment or removal",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation detected. The use of protobuf deserialization is standard; no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for serializing Django models and querysets into dictionaries. It optionally deserializes protobuf objects via pb_to_dict. The functions rely on external, presumably trusted, library functions (model_to_dict, pb_to_dict). There are no signs of malicious data handling, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code appears straightforward and purpose-specific.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard serialization tasks with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious anomalies.",
