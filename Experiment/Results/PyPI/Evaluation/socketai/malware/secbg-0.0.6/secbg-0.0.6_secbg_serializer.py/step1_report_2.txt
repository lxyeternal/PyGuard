{
  "purpose": "The code provides serialization functions to convert Django model instances and querysets into Python dictionaries, with optional deserialization of protobuf objects.",
  "sources": "model_to_dict(obj), obj.ext_info_proto()",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leakage, code execution, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "model_to_dict() reads model data; pb_to_dict() deserializes protobuf data when with_extinfo is True.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code. No suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The functions are straightforward serializers for Django models and querysets, optionally processing protobuf objects. No input/output handling external to expected model and protobuf methods. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. Usage of standard library functions and clear parameters suggests benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard serialization logic with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not process external input in a risky manner or perform dangerous operations.",
