  "security_risk": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.65,
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate to high suspicion of malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate, but a slight increase in malware score to 0.5 would better reflect the risk level. Further analysis of the full codebase is recommended to confirm malicious payloads."
