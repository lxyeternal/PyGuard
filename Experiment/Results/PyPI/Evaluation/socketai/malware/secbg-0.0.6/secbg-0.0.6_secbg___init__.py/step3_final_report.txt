  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variables, dynamic execution points (eval, exec), hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system modifications, data exfiltration points, system commands, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., eval, exec, network) leading to potential data leaks, system modifications, or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (0.8), dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, misleading variable names, unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent. The presence of hardcoded secrets and eval/exec functions further increase suspicion. The obfuscation score of 0.8 and malware score of 0.4 are justified but could be slightly increased given the patterns. The security risk score of 0.6 aligns with the potential for hidden malicious behavior. The confidence score of 0.65 reflects moderate certainty based on the described features.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate to high suspicion of malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate, but a slight increase in malware score to 0.5 would better reflect the risk level. Further analysis of the full codebase is recommended to confirm malicious payloads.",
