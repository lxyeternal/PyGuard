  "conclusion": "The code's use of subprocess to dynamically import modules is an unconventional technique that could be exploited if 'secrevtwo' is malicious. No direct malicious payloads are evident, but the method's potential for abuse warrants elevating the security concern. Current scores underestimate the risk; a malware score of around 0.1-0.2 remains appropriate, but the risk score should be increased to approximately 0.5 to reflect the suspicious technique. Further investigation into 'secrevtwo' is recommended before deployment."
