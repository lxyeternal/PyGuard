      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code's use of subprocess to dynamically import modules is an unconventional technique that could be exploited if 'secrevtwo' is malicious. No direct malicious payloads are evident, but the method's potential for abuse warrants elevating the security concern. Current scores underestimate the risk; a malware score of around 0.1-0.2 remains appropriate, but the risk score should be increased to approximately 0.5 to reflect the suspicious technique. Further investigation into 'secrevtwo' is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign serialization utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk stems from optional protobuf deserialization, which is standard practice and not inherently dangerous here. Scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and a very low security risk."

      "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate to high suspicion of malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate, but a slight increase in malware score to 0.5 would better reflect the risk level. Further analysis of the full codebase is recommended to confirm malicious payloads."

      "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated set of environment-dependent runtime patches affecting DNS resolution, socket connections, request handling, and logging. While no explicit malware or malicious payloads are detected, the extensive control over network behavior could be exploited for traffic interception, redirection, or covert monitoring. The overall security risk is moderate to high (~0.6), primarily due to its potential for misuse rather than inherent malicious intent. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0, but caution is advised when deploying in untrusted environments."
