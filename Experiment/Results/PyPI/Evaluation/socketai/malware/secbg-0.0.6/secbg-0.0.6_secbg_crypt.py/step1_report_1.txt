  "purpose": "This code provides functions to encrypt and decrypt client IP addresses using AES encryption in CBC mode.",
  "sources": "The functions take 'key' and 'raw' data as input; the raw IP address string and the key for encryption/decryption.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted data is returned as base64-encoded string; decryption returns raw IP data. No external sinks or network transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Input raw IP + key -> Encryption function -> Base64-encoded ciphertext (output). Encrypted data -> Decryption function -> Raw IP (output).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network or file operations. Use of standard cryptographic library appears legitimate. No signs of malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AES encryption/decryption with CBC mode. It applies PKCS#7-like padding for block size alignment, uses a random IV for each encryption, and encodes the ciphertext with base64. All operations follow conventional cryptographic practices. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns. The use of external 'common.crypt' module is noted but presumed benign unless further details show otherwise. No data leakage, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement standard, legitimate cryptographic functions for IP address obfuscation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
