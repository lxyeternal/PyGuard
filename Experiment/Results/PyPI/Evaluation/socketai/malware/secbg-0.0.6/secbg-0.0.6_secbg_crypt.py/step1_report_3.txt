  "purpose": "Encrypt and decrypt client IP addresses using AES encryption in CBC mode with base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'key', 'raw', 'enc'; imports from 'Crypto', 'common.crypt', and 'base64'.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted data output, decrypted plaintext output.",
  "flows": "Input raw data -> pad -> encrypt -> base64 encode -> output; Input encrypted data -> base64 decode -> decrypt -> output plaintext.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a static block size, a custom padding scheme, and relies on 'common.crypt' for AES; no obvious anomalies in code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard AES CBC mode encryption and decryption with base64 encoding. It pads data manually and generates a random IV for each encryption. No hardcoded secrets are present. The use of 'common.crypt' is unclear but presumably contains the AES implementation. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or executing external commands. It appears to be a straightforward encryption utility without suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard AES CBC encryption/decryption implementation with no evident malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It securely handles IVs and encrypts client IP data. No malicious activity or security risks are identified based on this code segment.",
