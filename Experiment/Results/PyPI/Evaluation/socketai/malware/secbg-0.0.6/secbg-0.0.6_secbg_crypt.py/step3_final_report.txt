  "purpose": "Provides AES CBC encryption/decryption for client IP addresses with manual PKCS#7 padding, IV generation, and base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "Input data: raw IP address string; Key parameter passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted output (base64 string), decrypted raw IP string.",
  "flows": "Input raw IP -> padding -> encrypt with AES (using key and IV) -> prepend IV -> base64 encode -> output; base64 decode -> extract IV -> decrypt -> remove padding -> output raw IP.",
  "anomalies": "Manual padding implementation; reliance on external 'common.crypt' module; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AES CBC encryption with proper IV handling and PKCS#7-like padding. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The padding logic appears correct, and the use of base64 encoding is appropriate. External dependencies are not shown but presumed benign. No obfuscation or backdoors are present. The security practices are sound, and the code's purpose is legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, correctly implemented AES encryption utility for client IP addresses. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or high security risks are detected. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
