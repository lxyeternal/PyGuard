  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, correctly implemented AES encryption utility for client IP addresses. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or high security risks are detected. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1) are justified and appropriate."
