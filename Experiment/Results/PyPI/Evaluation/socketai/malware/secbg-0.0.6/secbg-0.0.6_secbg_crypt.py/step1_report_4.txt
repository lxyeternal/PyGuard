{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encrypt and decrypt client IP addresses using AES encryption in CBC mode with base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "The functions read 'key' and 'raw' (plaintext IP data) as input parameters; 'enc' (encrypted data) is also an input for decryption.",
  "sinks": "The encrypted output is returned as base64-encoded data; decryption outputs plaintext. No external data sources or output sinks are explicitly used outside these functions.",
  "flows": "The raw IP is padded, encrypted with a key and IV, then base64 encoded for output; for decryption, data is base64 decoded, IV extracted, and plaintext decrypted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated padding method (manual PKCS7 padding), reliance on external 'Crypto' library without validation, and lack of key handling details. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard symmetric encryption/decryption of IP data with proper IV generation and padding. There are no suspicious behaviors like network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The padding scheme is manual but typical for such implementations. The code relies on external 'Crypto' library and 'common.crypt', but no malicious or maliciously obfuscated code is apparent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of AES encryption/decryption for IP addresses with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose of securing IP data, with no malicious or suspicious features detected.",
