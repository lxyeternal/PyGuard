{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for encrypting and decrypting data (specifically client IP addresses) using AES encryption in CBC mode with PKCS#7 padding, encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'key' and 'raw' in 'encrypt_client_ip', input parameter 'enc' in 'decrypt_client_ip'.",
  "sinks": "Return of base64-encoded encrypted data; decryption output.",
  "flows": "Input 'raw' data is padded, encrypted with a key and IV, and then encoded; during decryption, the process is reversed to recover the original data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; use of standard cryptography practices; no unusual code patterns. 'key' is passed as a parameter, reducing risk of hardcoded secrets. The padding scheme is manually applied but correct. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses the 'Crypto' library to generate a random IV and perform AES encryption in CBC mode with PKCS#7 padding. The raw data is padded manually before encryption. During decryption, the IV is extracted from the encrypted data, and the original data is recovered by removing the padding. The use of base64 encoding facilitates safe transmission or storage of encrypted data. No malicious behaviors such as network activity, data leakage, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of symmetric encryption for client IP addresses, likely used to securely transmit or store this data.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard encryption and decryption functions without evident malicious intent or security flaws. No suspicious behavior or malware signs are present. The implementation appears correct and secure for its intended purpose.",
