  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encrypt and decrypt client IP addresses using AES encryption in CBC mode with PKCS7 padding.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'key' (encryption key), 'raw' (plaintext IP address), 'enc' (encrypted data).",
  "sinks": "Encrypted output returned as base64 string, decrypted plaintext IP address.",
  "flows": "raw input -> padding -> IV generation -> encryption -> base64 encode -> output; base64 decode -> IV extraction -> decryption -> remove padding -> output plaintext.",
  "anomalies": "Uses custom padding method; relies on external 'common.crypt' which is not shown; no apparent malicious behavior in this snippet; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements AES-CBC encryption with PKCS7 padding manually applied via appending characters. It uses Crypto.Random for IV generation, which is standard. The decryption correctly removes padding based on the last byte. No dangerous or suspicious operations are present. No external suspicious behaviors or code obfuscation are evident. The overall structure is typical for symmetric encryption functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard AES encryption/decryption for client IP addresses with no apparent malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate utility for encryption tasks, assuming proper key management. No malware or malicious behaviors are detected.",
