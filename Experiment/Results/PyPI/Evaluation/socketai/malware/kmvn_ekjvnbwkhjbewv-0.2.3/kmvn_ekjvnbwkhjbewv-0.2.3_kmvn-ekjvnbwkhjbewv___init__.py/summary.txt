  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external, suspicious URL over unencrypted HTTP. While it does not execute malicious payloads or obfuscate its code, its intent and behavior are highly suspicious and indicative of data theft. Therefore, it should be considered malicious with high security risk."
