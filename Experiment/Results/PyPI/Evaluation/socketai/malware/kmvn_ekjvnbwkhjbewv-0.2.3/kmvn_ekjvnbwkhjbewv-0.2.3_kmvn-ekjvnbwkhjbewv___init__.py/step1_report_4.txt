  "purpose": "Collect system metrics and send them to an external server",
  "sources": "os.uname(), os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname(), os.getlogin(), and the constructed URL with query parameters",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to an external URL with system data as query parameters",
  "flows": "Data from os.uname(), os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname(), and os.getlogin() flows into the URL query parameters, then sent via HTTP GET request",
  "anomalies": "The URL used in requests.get() is suspicious, with a non-standard domain and an obfuscated-looking URL; no validation or sanitization of inputs; use of os.getlogin() without error handling; no indication of user consent or explicit purpose",
  "analysis": "The code gathers basic system information: OS name and release, current working directory, hostname, and login username. It then constructs an HTTP GET request to a suspiciously obscure domain with this data as query parameters. The URL appears intentionally obfuscated or generated, possibly to hide malicious intent. Sending system details to an external server without user consent or transparent purpose is suspicious. There are no safeguards or validation mechanisms. This pattern resembles data exfiltration behavior, potentially malicious depending on context.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects system information and transmits it to an external, suspicious domain without transparency, which is indicative of potentially malicious activity such as data exfiltration. The overall behavior warrants caution and further investigation, especially regarding the external server's purpose.",
