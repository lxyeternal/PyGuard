{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and uses setup() parameters for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the script primarily prepares package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md (source) to include in long description; passing parameters to setup() (sink) for package creation.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'kmvn_ekjvnbwkhjbewv' appears non-descriptive or intentionally obfuscated; author email is a generic or suspicious address, potentially indicating obfuscation or malicious intent. The long_description is static and uninformative, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities, reads a README file, defines version and description variables, and calls setup() with package metadata. No user input is processed, and no code execution beyond static setup configuration occurs. The obfuscated-looking package name and generic email are unusual but not necessarily malicious. The script does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or other suspicious activities. It appears to be a standard package setup script with some signs of obfuscation or minimalism, but no malicious code or behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with some suspicious naming conventions, but it does not contain malware or security risks. The overall security risk is low, though the obfuscated package name and generic contact email merit further review for intent.",
