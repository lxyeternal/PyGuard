  "purpose": "This script configures and sets up a Python package distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long_description; input data not present in code; no external input sources",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "N/A — setup configuration without data flows or external untrusted data handling",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated package name 'kmvn_ekjvnbwkhjbewv' which could be used to mask malicious intent; minimal descriptive information; no version control or security measures present",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration script. It reads a README.md file for long description, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with required parameters. The package name appears intentionally obscure and non-descriptive, which can be suspicious but isn't inherently malicious. No user input, environment variables, or network activity is involved. The dependencies are limited to 'requests', which is common. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The script is minimal and straightforward, serving a typical packaging purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script for a Python package. The obscured package name could suggest an attempt to hide its purpose, but there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or malware in this code. Overall security risk is low.",
