  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, static package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no code execution, network activity, or data handling present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated package name 'kmvn_ekjvnbwkhjbewv'; suspicious but not malicious. Author email from 'wearehackerone.com' with a suspicious username 'serverinspector+2'. Placeholder descriptions ('test', 'Learning stuff or whatever').",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, standard setup script with no dynamic or malicious behaviors. The main concern is the obfuscated package name and the suspicious email, which could indicate red flags but do not constitute malicious activity. No network calls, code injection, or data exfiltration are present. The package name's obfuscation warrants further review of the package contents, but based solely on this script, there is no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with an obfuscated package name that warrants further inspection but no current evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
