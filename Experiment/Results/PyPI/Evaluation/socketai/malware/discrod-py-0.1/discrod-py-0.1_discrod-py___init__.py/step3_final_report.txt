{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be minimal, straightforward, and free of malicious patterns or obfuscation, serving likely as a benign utility or placeholder.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, input, or data reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network connections, or data leaks are detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists due to the absence of code or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is either empty or contains standard, non-suspicious constructs; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or dynamic execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either minimal, standard, or empty, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The reports' assessments are consistent, assigning zero malware and obfuscation scores, with very low security risks (0.0 to 0.2). The confidence levels are appropriate given the limited or absent code. No suspicious patterns, external connections, or data leaks are identified. The overall evaluation indicates a benign nature with negligible security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scoring and assessments across all reports are accurate and justified based on the provided information.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
