{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python script performing specific data processing or utility functions, but without more context, it is unclear what the exact application is.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, environment variables, and potentially external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to standard output, logs, or possibly written to files; there are also potential network connections if socket or requests modules are used.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (outputs, logs, network).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code constructs, or unusual dynamic code execution detected. No obfuscated code patterns or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure suggests standard practices with function definitions, input handling, and output. No malicious patterns like data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are visible. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical. No suspicious network activity, system modification, or credential handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility or processing script with no indicators of malicious intent. The overall security risk is low.",
