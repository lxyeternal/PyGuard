{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or utility functions. No explicit purpose indicating malicious activity is evident from the visible structure.",
  "sources": "Input data could originate from function parameters, imported modules, environment variables, or file reads if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, system commands, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Data flow from inputs (e.g., user input, environment variables) to outputs or network requests, if any, could indicate data exfiltration or malicious command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is either minimal or absent of suspicious behavior. It uses standard Python structures and libraries without any signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. There are no indicators of data leakage, unauthorized network activity, or malicious modifications. The code structure does not suggest supply chain compromise or embedded malware. Due to lack of apparent malicious components and standard practices, the overall security posture appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. The code seems to be a typical, benign Python script without suspicious patterns.",
