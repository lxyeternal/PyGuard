  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and covert execution of a PowerShell command, which is highly suspicious and likely malicious. The high scores are justified by the obfuscation, silent execution, and potential for remote code activity. It should be treated as a security threat until further analysis confirms safety."
