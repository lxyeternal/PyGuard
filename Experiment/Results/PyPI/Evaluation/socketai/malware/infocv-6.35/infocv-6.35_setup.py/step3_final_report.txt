{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package 'infocv' and conditionally executes an obfuscated PowerShell command if the directory 'tahg' does not exist.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; execution of subprocess with encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "Execution of a hidden, encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen",
  "flows": "Filesystem check -> Conditional branch -> PowerShell command execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently with suppressed errors; broad try-except blocks hiding failures",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup but contains a suspicious conditional execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command. The command is encoded, executed with hidden window flags, and errors are suppressed, indicating attempts to conceal malicious activity. The scores across reports (malware ~0.75, obfuscation ~0.8-0.9, risk ~0.8) are justified given the evidence of covert, potentially remote code execution. The obfuscation and silent execution are common tactics in malicious payloads, warranting high suspicion. Decoding the PowerShell command is necessary for definitive analysis, but current signals strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and covert execution of a PowerShell command, which is highly suspicious and likely malicious. The high scores are justified by the obfuscation, silent execution, and potential for remote code activity. It should be treated as a security threat until further analysis confirms safety.",
