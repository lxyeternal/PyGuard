  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, including pre- and post-install scripts.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET requests to 'http://poiqwe.info/install_*' URLs within custom command classes.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs which could be used for command-and-control or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "During package installation/development, the custom run methods execute HTTP GET requests to external server, potentially triggered during package install.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external HTTP requests during installation processes; URLs are obscure and suspicious; no input validation or authentication on requests.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom setuptools commands that perform HTTP GET requests to external URLs during both pre- and post-installation phases, in development and installation modes. These requests could be used to trigger malicious activities such as executing remote commands, downloading malicious payloads, or exfiltrating data. The URLs are obscure, and the code lacks any verification or encryption for these requests. The rest of the code is standard setup logic with no additional suspicious activity. No hardcoded secrets are visible; the main concern is the external calls during installation, which could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes external HTTP requests during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious, as it could serve as a backdoor or command-and-control channel. The URLs are obscure and could be used for malicious purposes, representing a security risk.",
