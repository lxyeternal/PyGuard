  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The setup script defines custom commands for pre- and post-installation (both for development and standard installation).\n- Each custom command performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL ('http://poiqwe.info/...') during execution.\n- The code imports modules like `requests` and `pty`, with the latter seemingly unnecessary.\n- The `install_requires` list contains an empty string, which is invalid and suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Are the reported issues present in the code?**\n\n**Yes.**  \nAll reports correctly identify that during the execution of custom commands, HTTP requests are made to external, suspicious URLs (`poiqwe.info`). This is clearly visible in the code's `run()` methods of each custom command class.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning**\n\n- **Accurate detection of malicious behavior:** The reports correctly interpret the network requests as potentially malicious, given the suspicious domain and their placement in setup routines.\n- **Potential benign explanations:** While the reports lean towards malicious intent, they do not consider that such code could be used for legitimate purposes (e.g., telemetry, license checks). However, given the domain and context, suspicion is justified.\n- **Empty string in `install_requires`:** The reports note this as suspicious, which is correct; it could be an obfuscation or a mistake.\n- **Unnecessary import (`pty`):** The reports mention this but do not dwell on it; it's a minor flaw but worth noting.\n\n**Overall:** The reports' reasoning is sound and aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores given to each issue**\n\n- **Malware score:**\n  - Reports assign malware scores between 0.75 and 0.9, reflecting high suspicion.\n  - The code's behavior (external network requests during setup to suspicious domains) justifies high malware scores.\n\n- **Security risk score:**\n  - Also high (0.6 to 0.9), which seems appropriate given the context.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nThe scores seem reasonable. The high malware scores are justified by the malicious nature of making unsolicited external requests during setup.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for high risk scores (>0.5)**\n\n- The code makes network requests to obscure domains during installation, which can be used for:\n  - Command and control (C2) operations\n  - Data exfiltration\n  - Tracking or user identification\n  - Triggering malicious payloads on the client system\n\n- The external URLs are suspicious and not related to standard package behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHigh risk scores (>0.5) are justified due to the potential for malicious activity and the suspicious nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware score reflection**\n\n- The malware scores (around 0.75–0.9) are justified because:\n  - External requests during setup can be used maliciously.\n  - The domain is obscure and suspicious.\n  - No safeguards or validation are present.\n  - The code could be part of a supply chain attack.\n\n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims based on assumptions**\n\n- The reports assume malicious intent based on the external requests and suspicious URLs.\n- While the code could be benign (e.g., telemetry), the context and behavior strongly suggest malicious activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets or payloads are visible, but the network behavior alone warrants suspicion.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe assumption of malicious intent is reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of scores with the report**\n\n- The scores are consistent across reports, reflecting high suspicion.\n- The malware scores align with the behavior.\n- The security risk scores are also consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment and recommendations:**\n\n**Overall, the code's behavior is highly suspicious and likely malicious.**  \nThe external requests during setup are a common tactic in supply chain attacks or malware distribution.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                                                 |\n|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**   | **0.9**           | External network calls to suspicious domains during setup are highly malicious. |\n| **Obfuscated**| **0**             | The code is straightforward; no obfuscation is evident.                     |\n| **Risk**      | **0.9**           | High potential for exploitation, data exfiltration, or remote control.     |\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code contains malicious behavior with high confidence.\n- The network requests are the primary indicator.\n- The overall security risk is very high.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis package should be flagged, and the external URLs should be blocked or scrutinized further. If encountered in the wild, it warrants immediate removal from supply chains and further forensic analysis.",
