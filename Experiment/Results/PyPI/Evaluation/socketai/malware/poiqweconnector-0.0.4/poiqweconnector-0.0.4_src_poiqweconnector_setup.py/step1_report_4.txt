{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with custom pre- and post-installation commands that perform HTTP GET requests to specific URLs during installation and development setup.",
  "sources": "Requests are made to external URLs within the run methods of custom command classes (PostDevelopCommand, PostInstallCommand, PreDevelopCommand, PreInstallCommand).",
  "sinks": "The external requests could potentially be used to trigger malicious server-side actions, or to exfiltrate data if the URLs are controlled by an attacker. The code itself does not leak data directly but contacts external servers.",
  "flows": "During package installation or development setup, the custom commands trigger HTTP GET requests to external URLs. These requests occur before or after the main install/develop routines, establishing a source-to-sink flow from command execution to external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending HTTP requests to suspicious domains ('poiqwe.info') during installation processes, which is not standard for typical setup scripts. The URLs are hardcoded and suspicious. The commented-out 'apt-get' calls are harmless but suggest possible further malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom setup commands that execute HTTP GET requests to external URLs at various points during installation or development setup. These URLs ('http://poiqwe.info/install_post_dev', etc.) are suspicious and could be used to trigger malicious server-side scripts, exfiltrate information, or perform other malicious activities. The code does not process or verify the responses, nor does it handle errors, increasing the risk that malicious actions could occur silently. The inclusion of requests in setup routines is a red flag for supply chain attack vectors, as it could be used to activate malicious payloads upon installation. The code overall is suspicious due to the external calls to questionable domains and the lack of security checks.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script contains suspicious behavior with hardcoded URLs that perform HTTP requests during installation and development. The external calls could be malicious, potentially used to activate or download malicious payloads, constituting a security risk. The overall code should be regarded as suspicious, and the URLs should be verified or blocked.",
