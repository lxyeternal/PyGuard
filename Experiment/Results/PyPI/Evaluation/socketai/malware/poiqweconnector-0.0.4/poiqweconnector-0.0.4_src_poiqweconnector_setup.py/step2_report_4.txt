  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code indeed makes HTTP GET requests to suspicious URLs ('http://poiqwe.info/...') during the execution of custom setup commands.\n- These requests occur during installation and development setup, unconditionally, with no validation or user notification.\n- The URLs are obscure, and making network calls during setup is atypical and suspicious.\n- The 'install_requires' includes an empty string, which is invalid and could be a sign of obfuscation or incomplete code.\n- The code does not contain explicit hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads, but the external communication during setup is a red flag.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify the external HTTP requests during setup as problematic.\n\n- **Are the reasons justified?**  \n  Yes. Unconditional external requests during package setup are suspicious, potentially malicious, and can be used for tracking, exfiltration, or command-and-control.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The malware scores are high (0.75–0.9), which aligns with the potential malicious intent. The security risk scores are also high, reflecting the danger of such behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis per report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- Malware: 0.4  \n  Slightly lower, possibly considering that no payload or direct malicious code is shown, but network behavior is suspicious.\n- Confidence: 0.8  \n  Justified, given the suspicious URLs and behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. The malware score could be slightly increased to 0.5 to reflect the potential for malicious server-side actions.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- Malware: 0.9  \n  Justified due to the high suspicion and the potential for malicious server interactions.\n- Confidence: 0.9  \n  Justified.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. The report emphasizes malicious intent strongly.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- Malware: 0.8  \n  Justified, given the external calls and suspicious URLs.\n- Confidence: 0.9  \n  Justified.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate. Slightly higher malware score could be considered, but 0.8 is acceptable.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- Malware: 0.75  \n  Justified, with suspicion but no direct payload shown.\n- Confidence: 0.9  \n  Justified.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- Malware: 0.8  \n  Consistent with other reports.\n- Confidence: 0.9  \n  Justified.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n\n- The **malware scores** are generally high, reflecting the malicious potential of such external requests during setup.\n- The **security risk scores** are also high, which is justified.\n- The **confidence levels** are consistent, given the suspicious nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The **malware scores** could be slightly increased (e.g., from 0.75 to 0.8 or 0.9) in some reports to reflect the high risk of malicious activity.\n- The **security risk scores** are appropriate.\n- The **obfuscated** score remains at 0, which is correct, as the code is straightforward but suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final personal assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** ~0.85  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n**Risk score:** ~0.9\n\nThis package exhibits behaviors typical of supply chain attacks or malicious backdoors, and the high external communication during setup is a serious concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the malicious behavior. The scores are reasonable, with slight room for adjustment based on the severity of external network calls. The behavior warrants caution, and such packages should be flagged or blocked until further investigation confirms benign intent.\n\n**Next step:** Recommend banning or scrutinizing this package further, and possibly contacting the maintainers for clarification.",
