  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step to determine the actual security implications and appropriate scoring.\n\n**1. Code confirmation:**\n- The code clearly contains `requests.get()` calls to external URLs (`http://poiqwe.info/...`) within custom setup commands (`PostDevelopCommand`, `PostInstallCommand`, `PreDevelopCommand`, `PreInstallCommand`).\n- These requests are executed during installation or development setup phases, unconditionally.\n- The URLs are suspicious, obscure, and not related to typical package setup routines.\n- The code includes an invalid dependency (`\"\"`), which suggests poor maintenance or an attempt at obfuscation.\n\n**2. Issues identified:**\n- **Presence of malicious behavior:** The code contacts external servers during setup, which can be used for:\n  - Tracking installations\n  - Command and control (C2) activities\n  - Data exfiltration\n  - Triggering malicious payloads server-side\n- **Potential for malicious server-side code execution:** Since the server responses are not validated or sanitized, malicious payloads could be delivered.\n- **Unusual code practices:** Making network requests during package setup is highly atypical and suspicious.\n- **Obfuscation or incomplete code:** The empty string in `install_requires` and commented-out lines suggest possible obfuscation or incomplete malicious modifications.\n\n**3. Scores assessment:**\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Security Risk Score | Obfuscated | Confidence |\n|---------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------|------------|\n| 1       | 0.4             | 0.6                 | 0            | 0.8        |\n| 2       | 0.9             | 0.9                 | 0            | 0.9        |\n| 3       | 0.8             | 0.8                 | 0            | 0.9        |\n| 4       | 0.75            | 0.75                | 0            | 0.9        |\n| 5       | 0.8             | 0.9                 | 0            | 0.9        |\n\n- The malware scores are generally high, especially in reports 2, 3, 4, and 5, reflecting the malicious intent of external network calls during setup.\n- The security risk scores are also high, indicating a significant threat.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 across all, which aligns with the code being relatively straightforward, but the suspicious behavior outweighs this.\n\n**4. Justification for higher scores:**\n- The malware scores are justified as the code performs network communications to suspicious domains during package setup, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks.\n- The security risk is high because such behavior can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise.\n- The confidence levels are appropriately high given the clear malicious indicators.\n\n**5. Additional considerations:**\n- The reports correctly identify the URLs as suspicious.\n- The assumption that the code is malicious is justified; no benign explanation supports making HTTP requests to obscure domains during setup.\n- The presence of commented-out code and invalid dependencies further suggest malicious or at least poorly maintained code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.9** — due to external communication during setup with suspicious URLs, indicative of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — the code is not obfuscated; the suspicious behavior is clear.\n- **Security risk score:** **0.9** — high risk of malicious activity, including potential remote code execution or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is highly suspicious, performing external network requests during package installation, which is a red flag for supply chain compromise or malware activity. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. The reports' assessments are consistent with this conclusion.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** **0.9**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.9**\n\nThese reflect the significant malicious potential of this code.",
