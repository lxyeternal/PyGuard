{
  "purpose": "This code customizes the setup process for a Python package, adding pre- and post-installation hooks that perform HTTP GET requests to specific URLs during development and installation phases.",
  "sources": "The code reads external URLs ('http://poiqwe.info/...') during the run methods of custom commands for pre- and post-installation steps.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get calls send HTTP requests to external servers, potentially exfiltrating information or triggering malicious actions based on server responses.",
  "flows": "During installation or development setup, the code executes requests.get to external URLs, which could be triggered automatically without user consent, possibly leading to malicious server interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The code makes HTTP GET requests to a suspicious domain ('poiqwe.info') during setup steps, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The URLs do not indicate legitimate package behavior. The setup includes an empty string in 'install_requires', which is nonsensical. The comments suggest potential further malicious actions (e.g., installing packages via apt-get).",
  "analysis": "The code overrides standard setuptools commands to include requests to external domains during the install and develop processes. This behavior is suspicious because it could be used to track, control, or exfiltrate data. The URLs used are obscure and could be malicious command-and-control servers. The inclusion of requests calls in setup procedures is uncommon and indicative of malicious intent. The code does not verify responses or handle errors, increasing the risk of unintended consequences. Overall, these network calls during setup are a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script includes malicious behavior by making external HTTP requests to suspicious URLs during installation and development setup, which could be used for malicious control or data exfiltration. The code structure suggests intentional sabotage or malware activity.",
