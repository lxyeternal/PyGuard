{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom setup commands for a Python package, adding pre- and post-installation steps that perform HTTP GET requests to specific URLs.",
  "sources": "The code reads external URLs ('http://poiqwe.info/...') during the run method of custom commands, which are triggered during package installation or development setup.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get calls transmit data or request resources over the network to external domains, potentially revealing system information or triggering malicious responses.",
  "flows": "During package installation or development setup, the custom commands invoke requests.get to the specified URLs, which occurs immediately upon running these commands, possibly before any user interaction or validation.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs used are suspicious and non-standard ('poiqwe.info'), which is often associated with malicious activity. The requests are made unconditionally during installation steps, with no validation or user consent. The presence of these network calls in setup scripts is unusual and potentially malicious. Additionally, the 'install_requires' list includes an empty string, which is invalid and may cause issues or conceal malicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code implements custom setup commands that execute HTTP GET requests to external, suspicious URLs during both pre- and post-installation phases. These requests are executed unconditionally, which can be used to track installations, exfiltrate system information, or trigger malicious content. The use of unverified external URLs without any safeguards or user notification raises security concerns. The inclusion of an invalid dependency ('') in 'install_requires' further indicates suspicious or poorly maintained code. Overall, the code exhibits malicious intent by communicating with external domains during package installation, which could compromise system security or privacy.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior through forced network communication to suspicious external URLs during installation and development setup. The behavior could be used for tracking, data exfiltration, or delivering malicious payloads. The presence of such network calls in setup scripts is highly suspicious and warrants banning or further scrutiny.",
