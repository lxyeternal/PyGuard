{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup procedures for a Python package, including pre- and post-installation commands that perform HTTP requests to specific URLs during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "Requests to URLs 'http://poiqwe.info/install_post_dev', 'http://poiqwe.info/install_post', 'http://poiqwe.info/install_pre_dev', and 'http://poiqwe.info/install_pre' during the run methods of custom commands.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP GET requests send data to external servers, potentially leaking information or executing malicious server-side code. The code also imports potentially unnecessary modules such as 'pty'.",
  "flows": "During installation or development setup, the custom commands trigger HTTP requests to external URLs, which could be used for tracking, command and control, or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The code makes unsolicited HTTP requests to suspicious domains during setup, which is unusual and suspicious. The URLs are obscure and not related to common package setup routines. An empty string in 'install_requires' is also unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code extends standard setup commands to include HTTP requests to external URLs during the install and develop phases. This behavior could be benign but is more commonly associated with malicious activity such as tracking or command and control. No other malicious actions or hardcoded credentials are present. The requests could be used to confirm installation or to trigger malicious payloads on the server side. The presence of commented-out code and an empty string in dependencies suggest potential obfuscation or incomplete code.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs network requests to suspicious URLs during package setup, which could be used for malicious tracking, data exfiltration, or command-and-control purposes. This behavior is suspicious and warrants caution before using this package.",
