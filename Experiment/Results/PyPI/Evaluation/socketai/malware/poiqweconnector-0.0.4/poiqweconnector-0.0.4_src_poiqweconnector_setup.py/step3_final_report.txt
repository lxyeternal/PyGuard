{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom setup commands that perform HTTP GET requests to suspicious URLs during installation and development setup, likely for malicious purposes such as tracking, command-and-control, or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'http://poiqwe.info/install_post_dev', 'http://poiqwe.info/install_post', 'http://poiqwe.info/install_pre_dev', and 'http://poiqwe.info/install_pre' during run methods of custom commands.",
  "sinks": "External servers that could deliver malicious payloads, receive exfiltrated data, or establish command-and-control channels.",
  "flows": "Unconditional HTTP GET requests triggered during the execution of setup commands, during both install and develop phases.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious URLs, making network requests during package setup, invalid empty string in 'install_requires', commented-out code suggesting further malicious activity, and unnecessary import of 'pty'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs external network requests during setup routines, which is highly unusual and suspicious. The URLs are obscure and not related to standard package operations. The 'install_requires' contains an invalid empty string, indicating potential obfuscation or malicious intent. The requests are unvalidated and could be used for malicious activities such as data exfiltration or remote command execution. The code lacks error handling, increasing the risk of silent failures or malicious payload delivery. The overall behavior aligns with supply chain attacks or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75-0.9, risk ~0.6-0.9) are justified, but the malware scores could be slightly increased to reflect the high malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior indicative of malicious activity, primarily due to external communications to obscure domains during setup. The behavior aligns with supply chain malware or backdoors, warranting a high malware and security risk score. The package should be flagged and scrutinized further, with external URLs blocked or investigated.",
