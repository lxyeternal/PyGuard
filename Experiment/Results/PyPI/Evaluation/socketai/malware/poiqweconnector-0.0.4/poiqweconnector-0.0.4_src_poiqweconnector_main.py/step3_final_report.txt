{
  "purpose": "Establishes a reverse shell backdoor controlled via DNS TXT records, spawning a bash shell and redirecting IO over a network socket.",
  "sources": "DNS TXT query for 'poiqwe.info', socket connection to retrieved port, HTTP GET request on import",
  "sinks": "Socket file descriptor, os.dup2 for stdin/stdout/stderr, pty.spawn for shell execution",
  "flows": "DNS TXT answer -> socket connection -> IO redirection -> shell spawn",
  "anomalies": "Use of DNS TXT records for dynamic control, minimal error handling, HTTP request on module import, persistent polling loop",
  "analysis": "The code performs DNS TXT resolution to obtain a port, then connects to 'poiqwe.info' on that port, redirecting system IO to this socket and spawning a bash shell, effectively creating a reverse shell. When imported as a module, it makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL. These behaviors are characteristic of a malicious backdoor. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and uses standard Python libraries. The DNS-based control channel and the spawning of a remote shell indicate malicious intent. The HTTP request may be for signaling or exfiltration. The code's behavior aligns with known malicious patterns, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1, security risk: 1, obfuscated: 0) are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a malicious backdoor establishing a reverse shell via DNS control, with additional HTTP signaling. The reports correctly identify this behavior, and the scores are appropriate given the severity and clarity of malicious intent.",
