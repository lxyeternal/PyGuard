  "purpose": "Establish a covert reverse shell connection to a remote server by resolving a DNS TXT record for command-and-control instructions.",
  "sources": "DNS TXT record for 'poiqwe.info', which provides the port number; socket connection to the specified target and port.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection that redirects stdin, stdout, and stderr to the remote server, spawning a bash shell; HTTP GET request to 'http://poiqwe.info/install_bad' upon module import.",
  "flows": "DNS TXT record ('port' value) → socket connection to remote server → input/output redirection → shell spawn; Import trigger causes an HTTP request to remote URL.",
  "anomalies": "Continuous DNS polling for port information; redirecting system I/O to a network socket for remote command execution; executing '/bin/bash' via pty.spawn; making an HTTP GET request on import.",
  "analysis": "The script repeatedly resolves DNS TXT records to extract a port number associated with 'poiqwe.info', suggesting dynamic control. Upon obtaining the port, it establishes a socket connection to the domain and redirects all standard I/O to this socket, then spawns a bash shell—classic reverse shell behavior. The presence of DNS resolution, socket manipulation, and spawning a shell indicates malicious remote command execution capability. Additionally, when imported as a module, it makes an HTTP request to a remote server, possibly for reporting or further command/control signaling. These behaviors are typical of malware intending to provide remote control and data exfiltration.\n\nThe code does not include any apparent legitimate functionality; it’s designed for covert remote access, indicating malicious intent. The DNS-based port retrieval and persistent connection setup are characteristic of a backdoor or command-and-control component. The code does not seem obfuscated, but its behavior and control flow are suspicious and malicious in context.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a malicious backdoor, establishing a reverse shell via DNS and socket communication, with a side request to a remote URL. It is intended for unauthorized remote control, posing a significant security risk.",
