  "purpose": "Detect and evaluate malicious behavior in the Python code, specifically covert remote shell and command-and-control activities.",
  "sources": "DNS TXT records for 'poiqwe.info', socket connection to retrieved port, HTTP GET request when imported.",
  "sinks": "os.dup2 calls redirecting stdin, stdout, stderr to socket; pty.spawn executing shell; HTTP request on module import.",
  "flows": "DNS TXT answer -> port extraction -> socket connection -> I/O redirection -> shell spawn; import triggers HTTP GET.",
  "anomalies": "Use of DNS TXT for stealthy C2, spawning shell with redirected I/O, HTTP request on import, no authentication or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs DNS TXT resolution to obtain a port, connects to a remote server, redirects I/O streams to this connection, and spawns a shell, effectively creating a covert backdoor. When imported, it makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL. These behaviors are characteristic of malware, enabling remote command execution and stealth communication. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the malicious activities are clearly implemented. The high severity of these actions justifies maximum malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a malicious backdoor establishing a stealthy remote shell via DNS-based C2, with additional tracking or control via HTTP request. It poses a severe security threat and should be classified with maximum malware and risk scores.",
