{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'tpultragui' with an embedded potentially malicious subprocess call.",
  "sources": "Reading files ('tahg'), importing modules ('subprocess', 'os'), checking file existence, and executing subprocess command.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess command execution which could execute arbitrary code via encoded PowerShell command.",
  "flows": "Check if 'tahg' exists -> If not, run encoded PowerShell command -> Setup package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen, which is unusual in a legitimate setup script. The command URL contains suspicious domain 'esquelesquad.rip'. The code ignores exceptions silently.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import standard modules and conditionally executes a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64, which points to a suspicious domain. This command could be malicious, potentially downloading or executing harmful payloads. The setup function appears normal but is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors. The embedded PowerShell command and silent error suppression indicate malicious obfuscation and stealth tactics. No other malicious activities like data exfiltration or backdoor setup are explicitly visible, but the encoded command's purpose is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, likely for malicious purposes such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The package includes obfuscated code that suggests malicious intent, especially given the suspicious domain and silent exception handling.",
