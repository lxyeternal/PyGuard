{
  "purpose": "Detects malicious or suspicious behavior in the setup script, specifically the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during package installation, which may be used for malicious payload delivery or backdoor access.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen; external URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' in comments.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the encoded PowerShell command; potential network connection to external domain; silent error handling masking failures.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers the conditional execution; if 'tahg' does not exist, the subprocess runs the encoded PowerShell command, which may connect to external servers or perform malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Base64-encoded PowerShell command; silent broad exception handling; contact to suspicious external domain; execution during setup without explicit user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a filesystem check and conditionally executes an obfuscated PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is indicative of malicious obfuscation techniques. The command is run silently with no window, masking errors. The presence of a suspicious external domain ('www.esquelesquad.rip') further suggests malicious intent. The broad exception handling prevents error detection, increasing stealth. The setup call appears legitimate but is compromised by this hidden malicious payload. The high scores for malware (0.85), obfuscation (0.85), and security risk (0.9) are justified given these indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains high-probability malicious behavior through obfuscated remote code execution during setup, with external domain contact and error masking. It should be flagged as malicious or at high risk, and further investigation or removal is recommended.",
