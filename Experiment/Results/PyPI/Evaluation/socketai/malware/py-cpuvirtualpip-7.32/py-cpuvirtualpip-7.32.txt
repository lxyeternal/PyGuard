      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally during package setup. The obfuscation, silent execution, and embedded URL point to malicious activity with a very high security risk. The scores across reports are justified, though the obfuscation score in one report should be increased. Overall, this package should be considered malicious or at least highly suspicious."
