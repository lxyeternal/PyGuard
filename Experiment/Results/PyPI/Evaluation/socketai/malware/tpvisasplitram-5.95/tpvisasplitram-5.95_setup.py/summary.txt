  "malware_score": 0.85,
  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command connecting to a suspicious domain, with silent, conditional execution. The setup function is likely a cover. The scores are appropriate, and the overall security risk is high."
