      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, which is characteristic of malicious activity or backdoor behavior. The high obfuscation, hidden execution, and conditional logic strongly suggest malicious intent. The package should be treated as potentially malicious until the payload is decoded and verified. The scores assigned are appropriate and reflect the high suspicion level."
