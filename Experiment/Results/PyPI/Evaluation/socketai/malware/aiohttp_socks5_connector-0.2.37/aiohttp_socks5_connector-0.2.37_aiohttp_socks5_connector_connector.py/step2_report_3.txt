  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a proxy connector implementation for aiohttp, supporting configurable proxies, custom DNS resolution, and socket wrapping.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- Proxy URL construction relies on user inputs, which is standard.\n- Socket wrappers are created conditionally based on proxy type, with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nCorrectly identifies the code as a legitimate proxy connector with custom DNS resolver support. No suspicious behavior or backdoors.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 (very low, aligns with no suspicious activity)  \n- Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe low scores are appropriate given the absence of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nAccurately describes the code as a customizable aiohttp proxy connector. No malicious activity is detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 (still low, consistent with the analysis)  \n- Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nScores seem reasonable; no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nAgain, confirms standard proxy connection handling with no malicious signs.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2  \n- Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nAppropriate, consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nNotes that proxy credentials are used in URL formation, which could be exposed if mishandled, but in this context, it is standard. No malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2  \n- Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nScores seem justified; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nAgain, confirms standard proxy handling with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.1  \n- Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nAppropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate zero, which is justified. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1-0.2), reflecting standard proxy handling without evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a proxy connector with no signs of supply chain risk or malware.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- Maintain malware score at 0.  \n- Keep obfuscated at 0.  \n- Keep security risk low (~0.1-0.2), as the code handles proxy configurations responsibly.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears safe, well-structured, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified based on the code's content.",
