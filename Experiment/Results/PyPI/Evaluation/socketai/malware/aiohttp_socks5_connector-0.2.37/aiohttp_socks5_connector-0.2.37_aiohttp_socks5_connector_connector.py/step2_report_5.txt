  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of classes for managing proxy connections with aiohttp, including custom DNS resolution and socket handling.\n- Proxy URL construction is dynamic based on user input, with support for authentication.\n- Socket wrappers are created conditionally, depending on proxy type.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code aligns with standard proxy handling practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Well-reasoned, notes the use of custom resolver, proxy URL formation, socket creation, and legitimate proxy management.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (low)\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scoring. The high confidence (0.9) aligns with the reasoning.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard proxy configuration, dynamic URL creation, and socket management.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (still low)\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent with the code and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Focuses on proxy connection management, custom resolver, and socket creation. No suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Highlights proxy URL handling, socket wrapping, and connection setup. No suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate proxy handling.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Summarizes proxy configuration, URL parsing, socket creation, and connection management. No suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent with the code and the analysis. No malicious activity or code obfuscation is present.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1-0.2), appropriate given the code's purpose and the lack of suspicious activity.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured proxy connection handler with no signs of supply chain or malicious risks.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1-0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**In conclusion, the code is safe, and the scoring reflects that accurately.**",
