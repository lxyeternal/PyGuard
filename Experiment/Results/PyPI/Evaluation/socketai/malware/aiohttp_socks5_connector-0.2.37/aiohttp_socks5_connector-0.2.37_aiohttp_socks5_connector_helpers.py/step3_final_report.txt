{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for managing SOCKS proxy connections using asyncio, including URL parsing, socket wrapper creation, and connection establishment.",
  "sources": "URL input for proxy configuration, host and port parameters, optional proxy URL string",
  "sinks": "Untrusted proxy URLs and connection parameters used to establish network connections",
  "flows": "Input URLs and parameters are parsed and validated, then used to create socket wrappers which connect to proxies and target hosts",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URL parsing, socket wrapper creation, and connection setup with proper validation and error handling. It accepts user input for proxy configuration, which could be misused if malicious URLs are supplied, but this is inherent to proxy client functionality. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections in asyncio. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores accurately reflect its safety profile.",
