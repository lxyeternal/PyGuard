  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Finds no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is a standard SOCKS proxy client implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is indeed a typical implementation of SOCKS4/5 with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The low security risk score (0.2) aligns with the absence of known vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n- The confidence level is high, given the straightforward, standard code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, emphasizes standard asyncio SOCKS proxy wrappers, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is consistent with standard practices.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.\n- The very low security risk and malware scores are justified.\n- The confidence is high.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment is accurate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard SOCKS proxy wrappers, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code appears clean, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The low risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n- The reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues; the report's scoring and reasoning are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same general conclusion—standard implementation, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no hidden or suspicious elements.\n- The risk score is appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious features.\n- Malware score remains justified at zero.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning and scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SOCKS proxy implementation with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No obfuscation or backdoors are evident.\n- The code follows standard protocols.\n- The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk around 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The high confidence levels are justified.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1-0.2 (low, due to network code exposure but no vulnerabilities or malicious features)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears secure, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on this review, I would concur with the provided scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2.",
