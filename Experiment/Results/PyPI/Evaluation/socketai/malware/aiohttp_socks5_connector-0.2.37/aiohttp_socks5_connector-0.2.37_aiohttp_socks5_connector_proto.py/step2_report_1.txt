  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments, the code, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurate description of the code's functionality; standard proxy negotiation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no backdoors. Protocol adherence is correct.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.95), malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation. The low security risk score aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, correctly describes the code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1, reinforcing the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurate; standard proxy connection management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or secrets; standard protocol handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Similar confidence (0.9), malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Also aligns with previous reports, confirming no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly describes the code's functionality.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Same confidence (0.9), malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with prior evaluations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurate; describes typical SOCKS proxy client.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard implementation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Same confidence (0.9), malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Also aligns with previous reports.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None. All reports agree on the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting standard network proxy code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxies with asyncio.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network behaviors are present.\n- The protocol handling appears correct, with proper error handling and no signs of malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk ~0.1–0.2) are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and readable.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — standard network proxy code, minimal security concern.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nNo changes needed to the scores or assessments. The overall security posture of this code is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation detected.",
