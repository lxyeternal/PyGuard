{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS proxy client wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols for network connections, including negotiation and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters such as host, port, username, password, and target address. Reads data from network sockets during connection negotiation.",
  "sinks": "Sends constructed request data to proxy servers via socket, potentially sending user credentials or address data. Receives data from network sockets, which may include proxy responses or address information.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) flow into request construction, which then flow into socket send operations. Network responses from proxy servers flow into receive functions and influence control flow for success/failure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret keys present. No obfuscated code, no hidden backdoors, and no unusual code structures. Proxy negotiation logic appears standard and appropriate for SOCKS protocols. No external data leaks, code injections, or suspicious external communications are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers with support for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5. It performs address resolution, constructs protocol-specific request packets, and handles proxy server responses. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, secret theft, or network-based command and control. It adheres to expected protocol behaviors and uses standard libraries and structures. No suspicious anomalies or backdoors are evident in the code structure or logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with no indications of malicious intent. It does not include any malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms. It is a typical network proxy client wrapper with standard security considerations.",
