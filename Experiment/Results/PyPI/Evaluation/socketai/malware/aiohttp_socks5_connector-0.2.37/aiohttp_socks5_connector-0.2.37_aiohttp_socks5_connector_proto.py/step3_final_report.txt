  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers supporting connection negotiation, address resolution, and data transfer using asyncio.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hostnames, IP addresses, and connection requests during socket connection and address resolution.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows through socket send and receive operations, including connection requests and address data.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostnames/IPs) is resolved and sent via socket connections; responses are received and processed for establishing proxy connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; protocol handling appears standard and correct.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard asyncio-based SOCKS proxy client wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with proper error handling, address resolution, and negotiation procedures. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network anomalies are present. The code adheres to protocol specifications, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are justified based on the straightforward, standard implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. It poses minimal security risk and can be considered safe for use in secure environments.",
