{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy client wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols for establishing network connections through proxies.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration and credentials from class attributes (e.g., username, password, host, port) and network input from socket operations.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets for connecting to proxies and remote addresses; data sent over sockets during negotiation and connection process.",
  "flows": "Sources (e.g., credentials, hostnames) flow into socket requests and address resolution; data flows from input parameters through network socket communication during proxy negotiation and connection setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code follows standard proxy negotiation procedures. No unusual or misleading code structures or obfuscated code are present. Exception handling seems appropriate, focusing on network errors and protocol issues.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an asynchronous interface for establishing proxy connections using SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols. It manages socket creation, address resolution, and negotiation steps securely, without hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors. Usage of standard libraries and clear protocol implementations indicate no malicious intent. No data leakage, credential theft, or covert channels are evident. The error handling is standard for network operations. All network interactions rely on explicit parameters and proper exception handling, with no suspicious data exfiltration or backdoors observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers for network connection management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It does not include any suspicious or obfuscated code. Overall, the implementation is transparent and adheres to expected proxy negotiation procedures.",
