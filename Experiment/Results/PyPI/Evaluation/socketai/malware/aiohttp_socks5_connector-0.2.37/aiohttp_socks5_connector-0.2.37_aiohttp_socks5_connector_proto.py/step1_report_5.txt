{
  "purpose": "Implement SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols with authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data from network sockets (_receive, sock_recv), user input or parameters (host, port, username, password), and DNS resolution (_resolve_addr).",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions (_send, sock_sendall, sock_connect), potentially sending untrusted data over the network, and resolving hostnames.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from user-provided host/port, DNS resolution, and network socket receive/send functions to network communication, including authentication and connection negotiation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets found. No obfuscated code or unusual code constructs detected. The code properly handles network operations and exceptions. No backdoors or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SOCKS proxy protocols for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 with support for authentication, DNS resolution, and address handling. It uses common async socket operations, exception handling, and clean separation of protocol logic. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or backdoors. No suspicious network connections are initiated outside the protocol. No embedded secrets or obfuscated logic are present. The code appears to be a legitimate and typical implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy clients with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected network proxy operations with proper error handling, showing no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
