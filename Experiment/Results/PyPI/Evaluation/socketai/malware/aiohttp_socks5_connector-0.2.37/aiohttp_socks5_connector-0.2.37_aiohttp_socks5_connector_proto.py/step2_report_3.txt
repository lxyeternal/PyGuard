  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** The report accurately describes the code as a SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with standard request/response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors are identified. The code follows standard protocol implementations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that the code is legitimate and low-risk seems well-founded, with high confidence (0.95).\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. No issues are evident, and the scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** The code is an asyncio SOCKS proxy wrapper, with data flows typical for such implementations.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are noted. The code appears standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The low security risk (0.1) and malware score (0) are justified.\n- **Scores:** Same as above, reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent with the code, and the low scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Standard SOCKS proxy wrapper, with typical network data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. The code follows standard practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n- **Scores:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues detected; the report's conclusions and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** As expected, the code manages SOCKS connections, with data flowing through socket operations.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Same as above, standard SOCKS proxy implementation.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious code or backdoors are identified.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's evaluation appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, matching the code's straightforward implementation.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher (0.1-0.2) but still low, justified given the network operations involved.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, standard code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, mostly due to network exposure; no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**In conclusion,** the reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and accurate. The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (considering network exposure but no evident vulnerabilities or malicious behavior)",
