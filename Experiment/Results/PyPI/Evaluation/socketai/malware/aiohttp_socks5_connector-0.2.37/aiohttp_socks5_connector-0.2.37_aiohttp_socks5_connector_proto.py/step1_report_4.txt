{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of classes and functions for managing SOCKS proxy connections (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5) using asyncio, including negotiation, address resolution, and connection handling.",
  "sources": "Input data includes user credentials (_user_id, _username, _password), hostnames/IP addresses for destination and proxy, and data received from network sockets during negotiation.",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations such as sock_sendall and sock_recv, which could potentially transmit or receive untrusted data; data sent during authentication and connection requests; address resolution functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (hostnames, credentials) into network requests (negotiation, connect commands), and responses flow back from the server, with potential handling of untrusted server responses or data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code performs address resolution and socket communication following standard practices. No unusual or obfuscated code is detected. Exception handling is standard, and no backdoors or hidden behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a SOCKS proxy client with support for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, including authentication, address resolution, and connection negotiation. It uses asyncio for asynchronous network operations, handles errors appropriately, and does not contain suspicious code patterns or obfuscated sections. The data flow involves typical socket operations, and there are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy client functionality using asyncio, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles network communications securely and does not contain hidden or malicious code.",
