{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be part of a Python package related to proxy connections, providing classes, errors, and helper functions for establishing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no network or external data processing shown",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules are used for functionality; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior; the version string is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes, error definitions, and helper functions from internal modules and sets up module exports. It does not contain runtime logic, input handling, or data processing. No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns are present; it functions as a typical Python module setup for a proxy connection library.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard module initialization code with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply imports and exports components for a proxy connection package.",
