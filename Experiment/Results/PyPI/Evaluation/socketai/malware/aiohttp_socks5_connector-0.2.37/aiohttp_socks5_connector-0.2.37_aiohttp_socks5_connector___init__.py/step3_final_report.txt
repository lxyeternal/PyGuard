{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer for a SOCKS proxy library, importing and exporting relevant classes, errors, helpers, and protocol types.",
  "sources": "The code reads static import statements, version info, and defines __all__ for exports.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows exist; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely structural, consisting of import statements, version declaration, and export definitions. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, network activity, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, structural module setup for a SOCKS proxy library. All analyses and scores are accurate, and there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security concerns.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
