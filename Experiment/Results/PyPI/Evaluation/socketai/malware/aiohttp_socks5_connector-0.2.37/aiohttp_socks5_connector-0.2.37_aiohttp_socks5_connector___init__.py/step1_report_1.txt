{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a proxy client or library, defining imports and exposing certain classes and functions for proxy handling and errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems observed",
  "flows": "Imports from modules to the current module; no data processing or flow logic in this fragment",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements, versioning info, and __all__ exports. It functions as an initialization or interface setup for a larger package. No input sources, no data flows, and no sink actions are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The module's purpose is to organize and expose proxy-related classes and functions, with no evidence of harmful intent or malicious code inclusion.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup for a proxy library, with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign, structural part of a larger package.",
