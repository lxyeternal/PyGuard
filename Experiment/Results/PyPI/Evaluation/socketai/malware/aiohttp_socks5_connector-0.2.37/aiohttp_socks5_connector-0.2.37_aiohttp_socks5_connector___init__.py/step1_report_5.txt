{
  "purpose": "This module appears to define and expose classes, functions, and constants related to proxy connections, specifically SOCKS proxy handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or dangerous operations; no network calls, file operations, or data processing present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines module exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; code is straightforward and modular",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components related to SOCKS proxy handling and exposes them via __all__. It specifies a version string and organizes exports. No data processing, input handling, or network activity occurs within this snippet. The code appears to be a typical library module setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module definition for a Python package handling SOCKS proxy connections. It contains no malware, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is safe and exhibits typical structure for such a package.",
