  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the associated scores and claims.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward module setup for a proxy library, primarily importing and exporting classes, functions, and constants.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code is static, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external communication within this snippet.\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with their analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Presence of Issues:\n- The code snippet is purely import/export declarations with no dynamic or executable logic.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or harmful behavior is present.\n- The reported issues, such as malware or obfuscation, are **not** supported by the code.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**No issues are present in the code.** The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign and standard.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are appropriately set to 0 across all reports.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**No errors or flaws are found in the reports.**\n\n---\n\n### Score Justification:\n- The scores for malware, obfuscated, and risk are all 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n**No adjustments needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- Since the code is purely structural and does not perform any operations, it cannot be malicious or obfuscated.\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- Based on this review, I agree with the assigned scores:  \n  - **Malware Score:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  - **Risk Score:** 0\n\n- The overall assessment is that this code is safe, benign, and poses no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, benign module setup with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
