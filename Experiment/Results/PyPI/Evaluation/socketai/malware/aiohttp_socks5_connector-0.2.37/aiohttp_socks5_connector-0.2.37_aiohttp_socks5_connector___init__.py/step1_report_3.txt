  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports for a proxy-related package, setting up imports and exposing certain classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication in this snippet",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this code snippet",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed; no obfuscation or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and setting module-level metadata (__version__, __all__). No runtime data processing, external communication, or data handling occurs here. It merely exposes certain classes and functions for external use. There are no suspicious or malicious activities evident based solely on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup for a proxy package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this fragment.",
