{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and export components related to a SOCKS proxy implementation, including errors, connection helpers, and protocol types.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and components from local relative paths: .connector, .errors, .helpers, and .proto.",
  "targets": "There are no obvious sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations such as network requests, command execution, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports and re-exports components; no dynamic data flow, user input, or untrusted data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, serving as an index or __init__ module for a package, exposing classes, errors, and helpers. There are no signs of malicious logic, no data leaks, no network activity, and no code injection points. The code only imports and declares exports. No credential handling, environment variable use, or external data processing is visible. The versioning and module listing are standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization file that defines exports for a SOCKS proxy-related library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this snippet.",
