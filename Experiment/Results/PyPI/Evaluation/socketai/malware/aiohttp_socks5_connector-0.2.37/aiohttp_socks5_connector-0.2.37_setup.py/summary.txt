  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits heavy obfuscation, dynamic execution of embedded scripts, environment variable manipulation, and stealth techniques, strongly indicating malicious activity. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.9, obfuscated: 0.9, security risk: 0.9) are justified and consistent with the observed behavior."
