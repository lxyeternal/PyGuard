  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exception classes; no data input/output or external communication.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external effects.",
  "flows": "None; static class definitions with no dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class hierarchy with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from built-in exception classes. There are no executable statements, data processing, or external interactions. The class names are descriptive and standard for error handling. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The static nature and simplicity of the code strongly suggest it is benign and intended for error categorization within a larger application. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk detected. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
