  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy operations.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic behavior, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - No evidence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n   - The code appears to be a standard exception hierarchy, which is common in network-related modules.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that these are benign class definitions.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The reports appropriately dismiss any suspicion of malicious intent or security risks based on static analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores are consistent and justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since all evidence points to benign class definitions with no malicious behavior, raising the risk, malware, or obfuscated scores would be unjustified.\n   - The risk scores are appropriately low (0), reflecting the absence of security concerns.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the lack of malicious activity.\n   - No evidence suggests any malware or malicious intent.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as purely structural.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed, only logical, static analysis.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable ratings are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct, no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Assessment:\nThis code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions used for error handling in SOCKS proxy modules. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, static nature of the code and the thorough analysis provided in the reports.",
