  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy and connection errors.",
  "sources": "No data input sources or external data reads; all classes are simple exception definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; exception classes do not perform actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as this code only defines exception classes without logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exception handling, inheriting from standard exception classes. No data processing, external inputs, or operations are performed. There is no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation. The structure is straightforward and aligns with standard practices for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign part of a larger codebase intended for error handling related to SOCKS proxy operations.",
