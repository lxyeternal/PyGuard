{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only defines exception classes without reading external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input/output, or source-to-sink paths in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely consists of class definitions for exceptions without any unusual or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes for various SOCKS proxy errors and connection failures. It appears to be part of a larger application that manages SOCKS proxy connections. The class hierarchy is straightforward, extending base exception classes without any embedded logic, data handling, or external calls. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code serves a structural purpose only, defining error types.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for handling SOCKS proxy errors. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a benign component likely used for error handling in a larger system.",
