  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from standard exception classes.\n- No data input/output, external communication, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are identified.\n- The confidence level is high (1) across all reports, which aligns with the static and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and evaluations:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code is purely class definitions with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are present in this static code fragment.\n- **Confirmed:** No issues or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and standard for exception handling.\n- No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n- **No errors found.**\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score of 0 aligns with the absence of any malicious or suspicious code.\n- The \"malware\" score of 0 correctly indicates no malicious activity.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score of 0 correctly indicates no obfuscation.\n- **Scores seem reasonable and consistent.**\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- Since there is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk, a score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- All scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- The code is benign; no malware behavior is present.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**6. Challenging claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the static, non-malicious nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk:** 0 (no security issues)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is purely structural, defining exception classes.\n- There are no embedded malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, and no vulnerabilities.\n- The purpose is standard error handling, common in many codebases.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**System Note:** The overall assessment confirms that this code fragment is a standard, safe component of a larger system, with no security concerns.",
