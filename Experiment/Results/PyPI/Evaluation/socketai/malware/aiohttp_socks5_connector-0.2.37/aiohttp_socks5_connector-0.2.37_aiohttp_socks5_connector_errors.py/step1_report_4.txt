{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy and connection errors.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading; purely class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no operations that could leak data or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as these are exception class declarations only.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code contains straightforward class definitions for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines several custom exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions, mainly for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The structure and syntax are normal, and the code serves as a typical exception hierarchy for error management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger proxy or network-related project, focusing solely on error handling.",
