  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy and connection error handling.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only class declarations without executable code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions without unusual patterns or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions, with no data input, output, or external interactions. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The class hierarchy appears conventional for error handling in network or proxy contexts. No signs of malicious code, data leakage, or malicious behavior are present. The code is simple, structured, and follows typical Python exception declaration practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and related connection issues. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
