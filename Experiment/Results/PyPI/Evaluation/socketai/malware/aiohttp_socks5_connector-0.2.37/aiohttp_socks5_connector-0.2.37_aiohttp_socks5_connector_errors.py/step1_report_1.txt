{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various errors related to SOCKS proxy connections and authentication.",
  "sources": "No input data sources or external data reads; class definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; purely exception class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths, as this is only class declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, inheriting from standard exception classes. There are no data inputs, external communications, or dynamic behaviors. The classes are named appropriately for error handling related to SOCKS proxy operations. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks in this static code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes intended for error handling in SOCKS proxy modules. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior based on this content.",
