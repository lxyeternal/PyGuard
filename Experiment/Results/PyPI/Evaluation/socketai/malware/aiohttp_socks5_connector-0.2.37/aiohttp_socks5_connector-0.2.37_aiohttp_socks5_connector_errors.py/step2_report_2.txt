  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - No dynamic behavior, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected in these static class definitions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - No justification needed for higher scores, as the code is purely structural.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign malware = 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or exploits; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n   - They do not assume malicious intent where none exists.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and appropriate for static exception class definitions.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, straightforward set of exception class definitions for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Own Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities detected)\n\n**Final Note:**\n- These exception classes are typical boilerplate code, likely part of a larger, secure codebase.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on this static code snippet.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate, thorough, and appropriately score the static exception class definitions.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.",
