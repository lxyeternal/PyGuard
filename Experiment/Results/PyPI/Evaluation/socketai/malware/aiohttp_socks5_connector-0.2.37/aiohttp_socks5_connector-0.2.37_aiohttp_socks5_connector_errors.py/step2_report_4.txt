  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no data inputs, external communications, or executable logic. The classes inherit from standard exception classes, and their naming aligns with typical error handling patterns.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**  \nAll reports uniformly conclude that there are no anomalies, suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malware. Given the static nature of the code, this assessment appears accurate.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** 0, since the code does not introduce vulnerabilities or malicious activities.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws in the Reports**  \n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify that the code is benign and serve a structural purpose only.  \n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent that are unsupported by the code content.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Justification**  \n- Since the code is purely class definitions with no executable or malicious elements, higher scores are unwarranted.  \n- The reports' conclusions are justified, and their scores are reasonable.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**  \n- The static code is benign, with no security risks or malware.  \n- The exception classes are standard and do not pose any security threat.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**  \n- I agree with the scores assigned in all reports: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.  \n- No changes are necessary.  \n- The reports correctly interpret the code as a benign, structural component.\n\n**My own estimate after review:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the static nature of the code.",
