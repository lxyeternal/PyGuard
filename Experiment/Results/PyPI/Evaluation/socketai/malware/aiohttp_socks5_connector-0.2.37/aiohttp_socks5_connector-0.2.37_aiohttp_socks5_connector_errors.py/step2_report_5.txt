  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only consists of class definitions for exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no signs of data processing, external communication, or dynamic behaviors. The code is static and purely structural.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident. The conclusions about benign nature are well-founded given the static class definitions.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n- All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which aligns with the static, non-malicious nature of the code.  \n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, which is reasonable since the code is straightforward and clear.  \n- The `confidence` score is 1 across all reports, reflecting high certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores**:  \n- Since there is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities, no higher scores are justified.  \n- The reports are consistent in this regard.\n\n5. **Malware and Obfuscated Scores**:  \n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is indicated.  \n- The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n- The reports avoid assumptions; they only describe the static class definitions and their benign purpose.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Content**:  \n- The scores are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious code or behavior present.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Clear, straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks identified; the code is purely structural.\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n\nGiven the static nature of this code snippet, I agree with the assessments provided. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The exception classes are standard and benign.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- The reports are accurate and consistent.  \n- The scores are appropriate.  \n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \n- Maintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- Confirm that the code is safe and benign as part of the larger system.\n\n---\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' conclusions and scores.**",
