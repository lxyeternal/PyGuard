      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to encrypted payload decryption and execution during installation, obfuscation, and conditional Windows-only execution. The pattern indicates potential malware or backdoor activity. The scores of malware (approaching 1), high obfuscation, and high security risk are justified. The package should be treated as malicious until further payload analysis confirms benign behavior."
