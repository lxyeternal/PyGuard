{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with a custom installation step that executes potentially malicious code on Windows systems during installation.",
  "sources": "The custom install class executes code that imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and runs code via 'exec'.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec' function executes decrypted code which is retrieved dynamically, representing a potential sink for malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows ('os.name == \"nt\"'), the code imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a string and executes the result, which could perform malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated class and variable names, hardcoded Fernet key and ciphertext, and executes decrypted code without any validation. The purpose of the long description strings appears nonsensical. The presence of 'exec' with decrypted payload is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that runs only on Windows. It imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' libraries, then decrypts a hardcoded ciphertext with a hardcoded Fernet key, and executes the decrypted code. This pattern indicates deliberate obfuscation and potential malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads at install time. The use of obfuscated class names and encrypted code suggests an attempt to hide malicious behavior. The code's behavior is consistent with malware designed to run arbitrary code during package installation, especially on Windows systems. No other benign functionality is apparent. Overall, the code appears malicious, designed to execute hidden code at install time, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, encrypted, and dynamically executed code during installation on Windows, indicating a high likelihood of malicious behavior. It is designed to run arbitrary code during package installation, which poses a significant security risk.",
