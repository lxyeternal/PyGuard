  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, with a custom install command that decrypts and executes embedded code if on Windows.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment data (os.name), imports modules ('os', 'requests', 'fernet'), and executes decrypted code via exec().",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code with exec() (potentially malicious), network request imports, environment variable check.",
  "flows": "If on Windows, import requests and Fernet, then decrypt and execute code, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names, encrypted payload executed dynamically, conditional execution based on OS, decryption and eval-like behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a package with metadata and a custom installation class. The custom class 'ZmCMZcsgNgqcGOxkfCtkTLqizMdkEbFTQvlOHIrBbicMInJZbvxGwrLSMxImHjLjobxpDAwxxHmLbTsAvo' overrides the run method to execute code only if the OS is Windows ('nt'). It imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes an embedded payload via Fernet. The payload could contain malicious code, such as reverse shells, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The obfuscation of class and variable names suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. The decrypted code is executed directly, which is a high-risk activity.\n\nOverall, the presence of encrypted payload execution conditional on OS, obfuscation, and dynamic code execution strongly indicates malicious intent or backdoor behavior, especially since the decrypted content is unknown and executed without validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, encrypted payload execution conditioned on Windows OS, which is highly suspicious. It is likely malicious or intended as a backdoor, given the obfuscation and dynamic code execution practices. The package should not be trusted without further analysis of the decrypted payload.",
