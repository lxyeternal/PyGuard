{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform a custom installation process that, on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a hidden payload via exec(), likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), hardcoded encrypted payload and decryption key, and imports modules requests and fernet during install.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload executed with exec() acts as a sink, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Source: environment check and hardcoded encrypted data -> decryption with Fernet -> exec() of decrypted code (sink), only on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name, nonsensical description strings, hardcoded encrypted payload and key, conditional execution only on Windows, import of modules not used elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a conditional decryption and execution of a payload during installation on Windows, using obfuscation and hardcoded encrypted data to conceal malicious intent. The pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a classic malware tactic, indicating high suspicion. The obfuscation and encrypted payloads suggest an attempt to hide malicious activity, possibly a backdoor or remote control mechanism. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a significant security risk, and the code's behavior aligns with known malicious patterns. The high obfuscation and encrypted payload strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting a malware score close to 1. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to encrypted payload decryption and execution during installation, obfuscation, and conditional Windows-only execution. The pattern indicates potential malware or backdoor activity. The scores of malware (approaching 1), high obfuscation, and high security risk are justified. The package should be treated as malicious until further payload analysis confirms benign behavior.",
