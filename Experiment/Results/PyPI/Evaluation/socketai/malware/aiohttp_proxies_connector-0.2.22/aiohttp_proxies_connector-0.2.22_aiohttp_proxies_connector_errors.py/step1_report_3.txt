{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data input sources; only class definitions and exception hierarchy setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to external systems or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; these are class declarations for exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class declarations for various SOCKS proxy error scenarios. It establishes an inheritance hierarchy for error handling but does not include any input processing, data manipulation, network activity, or other potentially malicious operations. No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or obfuscated code is present. The structure is typical for defining exceptions and does not indicate malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application for handling SOCKS proxy errors, with no indication of malicious intent or supply chain security issues.",
