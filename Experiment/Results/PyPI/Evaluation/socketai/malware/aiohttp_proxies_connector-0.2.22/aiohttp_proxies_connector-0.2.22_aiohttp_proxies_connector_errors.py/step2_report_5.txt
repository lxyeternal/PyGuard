  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-examine the code and reasoning.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n- There is no runtime logic, data processing, network communication, or external input/output.\n- The classes are straightforward, inheriting from standard exception types.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are present.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is just class definitions with no malicious behavior or anomalies.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of each report:\n\n**Report 1-5:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** All correctly state that these are standard exception class definitions, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** All at 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated, malware, securityRisk scores:** All at 0, consistent with the code content.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- No issues are observed in the code or reasoning.\n- The reports do not overstate or underestimate risk.\n- The reasoning dismisses any possibility of malicious intent, which is correct given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Are the scores appropriate?**  \n  Yes. All scores are correctly set to zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n- **Are the conclusions justified?**  \n  Yes. The code is purely class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Any overlooked risks?**  \n  No. Given the code snippet, there is no indication of hidden malicious logic, obfuscation, or supply chain attack vectors.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, standard exception class definitions, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. No changes needed.",
