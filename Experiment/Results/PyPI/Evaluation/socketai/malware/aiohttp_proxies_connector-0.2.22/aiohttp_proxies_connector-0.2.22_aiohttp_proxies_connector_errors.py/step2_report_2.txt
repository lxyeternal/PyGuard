  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n   - No runtime data handling, network operations, or malicious logic are present.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are observed.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for error handling.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, aligning with the analysis.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, there is no need to justify higher risk scores.\n   - The code is purely definitional, with no malicious or security-threatening content.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports, matching the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - No suspicious or malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's straightforward nature.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is safe and standard.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments are evident.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context.\n- There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports' conclusions and scores are appropriate and well-justified.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final Remarks:**\nThe code appears entirely benign and serves a typical purpose in error handling. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
