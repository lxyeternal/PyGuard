  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors related to SOCKS proxy connections and authentication.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data ingestion; class definitions serve as error handling constructs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only defines exception classes without logic or data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors present; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard exception types. No data input, external interactions, or logic is present. All classes are standard inheritance structures with no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or obfuscation. The classes are likely meant for use in a larger SOCKS proxy handling library or application, serving as error indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply establishes exception classes for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context.",
