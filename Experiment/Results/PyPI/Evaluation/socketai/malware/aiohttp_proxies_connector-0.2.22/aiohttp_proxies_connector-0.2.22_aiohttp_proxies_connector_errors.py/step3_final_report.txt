  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues, serving as error handling mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exception types; no input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class inheritance without data or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with no unusual code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions inheriting from standard exception types. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. The code is clear, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
