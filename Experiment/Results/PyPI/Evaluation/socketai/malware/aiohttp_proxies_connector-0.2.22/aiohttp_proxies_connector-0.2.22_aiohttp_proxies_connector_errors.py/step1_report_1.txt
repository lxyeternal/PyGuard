{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general connection issues.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; code only defines exception classes without runtime data handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow; no processing or data manipulation occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only declares exception classes with no operational flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward class definitions for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class declarations for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy and connection errors. There are no data inputs, outputs, or suspicious behaviors such as data leaks, code injection, or malicious logic. The absence of executable logic, data handling, or network communication indicates no malicious intent or security concerns. The classes are standard practice for error handling and do not involve obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines standard exception classes for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears safe and straightforward.",
