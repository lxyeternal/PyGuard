  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, user input, or environment variables are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output or data handling occurs; this code only defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow involving untrusted data; this is purely class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns present. The class hierarchy is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exception types. There are no data processing, network operations, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or malicious patterns are visible. The structure is straightforward and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This code purely establishes exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and related connection issues. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be standard, harmless exception class definitions.",
