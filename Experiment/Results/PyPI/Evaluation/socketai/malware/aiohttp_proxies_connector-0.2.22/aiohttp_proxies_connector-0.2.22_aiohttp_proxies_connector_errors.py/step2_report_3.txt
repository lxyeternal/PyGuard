  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. There are no runtime behaviors, data processing, network interactions, or other executable logic. All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent. This is accurate given the code snippet. They do not overlook any potential issues, as the code is purely class declarations.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports, which is appropriate since the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security risk score:** 0 for all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks, there is no justification for raising the scores.\n\n5. **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify that the code is only exception class definitions without any executable or malicious components.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the reports:**  \n   The scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk evident)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no signs of supply chain attacks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### My estimated scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the code's simplicity and lack of malicious or suspicious features.",
