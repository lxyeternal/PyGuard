  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SOCKS proxy operations.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output, no untrusted data handling or vulnerabilities detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only defines exception classes without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code structures observed. The code solely defines exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for various custom exceptions inheriting from built-in exception types. These are standard practice for error handling in Python and contain no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. No sources, sinks, or flows are present. The classes are straightforward, with no malicious code or suspicious behavior. The structure indicates intended use for error handling related to SOCKS proxy operations, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, establishing custom exceptions for SOCKS proxy error management. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a standard, benign pattern of exception class definitions.",
