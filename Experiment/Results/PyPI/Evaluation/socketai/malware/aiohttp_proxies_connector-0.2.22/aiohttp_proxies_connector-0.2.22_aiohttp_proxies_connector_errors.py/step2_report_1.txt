  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details of the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No runtime data, network activity, or executable logic is present.\n- The code is straightforward, standard practice, and contains no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Evaluations:\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious logic, data leaks, or vulnerabilities.\n- The exception classes are standard and do not perform any operations or contain any data that could be exploited.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of data handling, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n**3. Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n- These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The confidence scores are 1, which is justified due to the straightforward, unambiguous nature of the code.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n\n- No risk scores are above 0.5, which is correct.\n- The code does not pose any security threat.\n\n**5. Malware Score Justification:**\n\n- Since the code only defines exception classes, there is no malicious activity.\n- Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n\n- All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations:\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.** They correctly identify the benign nature of the code and assign appropriate scores.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- Since the code is purely definitional and contains no operational logic, there is no need to adjust scores.\n- The thorough reasoning and high confidence levels are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0).
