  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- The code is straightforward class definitions with no runtime logic, data handling, or network operations.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are noted.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, and malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are 0.\n\n**Confirming issues in the code:**\n- The code matches the description: it's a set of exception class definitions. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that these are benign class definitions with no malicious intent.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated = 0 is correct.\n- Security risk = 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are indicated.\n- The purpose of these exception classes is standard practice, and the reports correctly reflect that.\n\n**Risk scores justification:**\n- Since all reports conclude no malicious or security issues, the risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**\n- No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is present. The code is purely class definitions.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports do not assume any malicious intent; they are cautious and accurate.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is appropriate.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores align well with the code and the analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and non-malicious.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no signs of supply chain attacks, malicious code, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are correct. The code poses no security risk, malware, or obfuscation concerns.",
