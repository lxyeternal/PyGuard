  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's behavior, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions for establishing SOCKS proxy connections using asyncio.\n- It parses proxy URLs, creates socket wrappers, and manages network connections.\n- The code uses external libraries like `yarl` and custom modules `aiohttp_proxies_connector.errors` and `aiohttp_proxies_connector.proto`.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The data flow is standard: input parameters → URL parsing → socket creation → connection establishment.\n- No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears to function as intended for setting up SOCKS proxy connections. No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No malicious code or backdoors are present.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No apparent vulnerabilities in input handling or logic.\n\n### Score assessments:\n\n#### Malware score:\n- All reports assign `0`. This aligns with the analysis that the code is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score should remain at **0**.\n\n#### Obfuscated score:\n- All reports assign `0`. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score should remain at **0**.\n\n#### Security risk score:\n- The reports assign low scores (~0.1–0.2). Given the code's purpose and proper validation, this seems reasonable.\n- The only potential concern is if untrusted proxy URLs are supplied, but this is standard practice.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely for establishing SOCKS proxy connections with proper validation, and no malicious activity is evident, higher scores are unjustified.\n- The functions do not perform any data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoor behaviors.\n- The use of untrusted input (proxy URLs) is typical for such utilities and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n| Metric          | Score (per reports) | Justification / Recommendation                         |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                   | No malicious code detected.                            |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                   | Clear, straightforward implementation.                 |\n| Security risk   | 0.1–0.2             | Low, acceptable given the context.                     |\n\n---\n\n### Final estimate:\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.2** (average of reports, acceptable)\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n- The reports are consistent with the code's analysis.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, secure utility for SOCKS proxy connections with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate, and I agree with the assessments provided.",
