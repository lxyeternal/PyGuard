{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for parsing SOCKS proxy URLs, creating socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies, and establishing asynchronous network connections through these proxies.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL input in parse_proxy_url; user-supplied host and port parameters; optional socks_url parameter for proxy configuration.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment via sock.connect; asyncio.open_connection and loop.create_connection using the socket; potential data flow from untrusted proxy URLs.",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url processes socks_url -> create_socket_wrapper creates socket -> connect() establishes proxy connection -> open_connection or create_connection uses the socket to establish network connection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials; straightforward URL parsing and socket handling; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard proxy connection setup with proper validation and exception handling. It uses external libraries appropriately and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. No vulnerabilities or backdoors are evident. The logic is sound, and the code aligns with typical network connection patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and the malware score remains at 0. Overall, the code is safe for use in its intended context.",
