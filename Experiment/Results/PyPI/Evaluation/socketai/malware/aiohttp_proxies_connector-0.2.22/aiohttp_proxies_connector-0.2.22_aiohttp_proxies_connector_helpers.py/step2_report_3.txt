  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**1. Code Functionality & Logical Validity:**\n- The code provides functions to parse SOCKS proxy URLs, create socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, and establish network connections asynchronously.\n- It validates input parameters, handles exceptions, and uses standard libraries (asyncio, yarl) and custom socket wrappers.\n- No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL patterns, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The functions are typical for proxy connection management, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors.\n\n**2. Presence of Malicious Code or Backdoors:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, code injection, or hidden behaviors.\n- Proxy URL parsing and socket creation are handled securely, with validation.\n- No suspicious external requests or data leaks are detected.\n- The external dependencies (aiohttp_proxies_connector, yarl) are standard and seem trustworthy.\n\n**3. Potential Vulnerabilities or Risks:**\n- The main risk lies in untrusted proxy URLs, but this is inherent in proxy configuration and not indicative of malicious intent.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are observed.\n\n**4. Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low risk due to potential misuse of untrusted proxy URLs, but overall low severity.\n\n**5. Logical Flaws or Errors in Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying the code's purpose and security posture.\n- No unreasonable score adjustments are necessary.\n- The high confidence levels (0.9 to 0.95) are justified given the straightforward, secure nature of the code.\n\n**6. Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, secure implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The low security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Estimated Malware Score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Estimated Risk Score:** 0.1 (low, mainly due to potential misuse of proxy URLs from untrusted sources)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a legitimate utility for SOCKS proxy management, with no evidence of malicious intent or security flaws. The reports' scores are reasonable and align with the code's behavior.\n\n**Critical conclusion:** The code is safe, with minimal security risk, and no malware or obfuscation concerns.",
