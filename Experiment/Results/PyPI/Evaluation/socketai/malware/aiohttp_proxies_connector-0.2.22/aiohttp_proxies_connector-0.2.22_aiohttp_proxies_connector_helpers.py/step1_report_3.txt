{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions to create and manage SOCKS proxy connections, including parsing proxy URLs and opening network connections via proxies.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters such as socks_url, host, port, and configuration values like proxy_type, username, password.",
  "sinks": "Uses asyncio's open_connection and create_connection with socket objects; connects to remote hosts via proxies.",
  "flows": "Inputs from parameters and parsed URLs flow into socket creation and connection functions, ultimately establishing network connections through proxies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or unusual code patterns detected. Proxy URL parsing is straightforward. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of SOCKS proxy connection helpers. It securely parses proxy URLs, handles connection setup, and manages proxy configurations. Usage of standard libraries and clear separation of concerns reduces risk. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The code does not perform any unintended data transmission or system manipulation. The only potential concern is if the proxy URLs are supplied from untrusted sources, but this is standard practice and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing SOCKS proxy connections with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
