  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the described code with the actual code snippet provided.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python module, primarily importing classes/functions from local modules and defining the module's public API via `__all__`.\n- It sets a version string and does not perform any runtime logic, data processing, or network operations.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Claim:** The code is a standard module setup with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The report correctly notes that the code only imports and exports symbols, with no runtime logic.\n- The confidence is high (1), and malware risk is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Claim:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the absence of data processing or external data handling.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The analysis aligns with the code: no data flows, no suspicious constructs.\n- The report's confidence is high, malware risk is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Claim:** Same as above—standard module setup, no malicious activity.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The assessment is consistent with the code snippet.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Claim:** The code is a typical Python package module setup, with a slight mention of a security risk score of 0.1.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The report states the code is standard, with no input/output or dynamic behavior.\n- The `securityRisk` score of 0.1 appears to be a cautious default or a minor concern, but given the code's simplicity, this is likely an overestimation.\n\n**Justification for adjusting the score:**\n- The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks.\n- The minimal `securityRisk` score seems unwarranted; it should be 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The `securityRisk` score should be lowered to 0 for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Claim:** The code is a package initializer with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Correctly notes the code's role as an import/export setup.\n- No external data handling or network operations.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings:**\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, as expected.\n- **Risk scores:** Most are 0, except Report 4's 0.1, which appears unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n- The code itself is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only point of contention is the `securityRisk` score in Report 4; it should be adjusted to 0.\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks evident)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a simple, standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy client library, with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are generally accurate, with a minor overestimation of security risk in one case.",
