  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code only imports local modules and sets up module exports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; straightforward static code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears to be a typical module initialization script with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. This seems appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the lack of data processing or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, a standard module setup with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), possibly due to the general pattern of module setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Given the code's simplicity, this is acceptable, though perhaps slightly conservative.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: no external data, no malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard module initialization file for a Python package, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the actual code content.\n- No changes are necessary; the evaluations are appropriate.\n\n### My overall estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk present)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that.",
