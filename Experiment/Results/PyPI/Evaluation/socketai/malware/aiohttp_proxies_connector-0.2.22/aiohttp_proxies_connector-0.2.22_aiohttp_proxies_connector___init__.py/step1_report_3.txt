{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a Python module related to proxy connections, including imports, versioning, and exports of classes and functions for proxy handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) which provide the core functionality and error handling.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no network connections, data transmissions, or external data handling are directly visible.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up imports and exports, with no runtime data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code; the module is straightforward and standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code only includes import statements, version declaration, and export definitions (__all__). It does not process input, handle data, or execute any logic that could be malicious. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module definition file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Since the code is purely declarative and structural, it does not pose security risks or contain malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a Python package related to proxy handling. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements and does not pose any security threats. It is a benign, structural part of a larger package.",
