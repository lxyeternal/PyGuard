  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code content, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward module setup: importing internal components, defining `__version__`, and listing exports via `__all__`.\n- No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- The code appears to be a typical `__init__.py` or module index file for a Python package.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correctly states that the code sets up module exports for a SOCKS proxy client library.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; version string is static.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; the code is purely declarative.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct, reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the code's role as a module setup without data processing or network activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct, consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- Reiterates the module's purpose, no data flow or suspicious activity.\n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Confidence: 1  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), perhaps due to cautious default.\n- No actual suspicious behavior identified.\n- The reasoning is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Confidence: 1.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but acceptable; no actual risk found.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- Similar to others, emphasizing the benign nature.\n- Correctly notes no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Confidence: 1.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** all 0, matching the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard module initializer with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code snippet is benign and purely structural, serving as an interface for a proxy library. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns.",
