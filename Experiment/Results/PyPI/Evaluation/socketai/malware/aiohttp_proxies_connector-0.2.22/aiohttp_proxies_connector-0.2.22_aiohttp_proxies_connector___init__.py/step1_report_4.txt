{
  "purpose": "The code defines module metadata, imports, and exports for a proxy-related Python package, likely to facilitate proxy connections and handle related errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module metadata (__version__), imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), and exports specific components.",
  "sinks": "Exports are used elsewhere when the package is imported; no direct sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up imports and exports for the package's API.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure appears standard for a Python package index module.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, error class imports, module versioning, and an export list (__all__). There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling. It appears to be a straightforward module initializer with no malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply organizes and exposes components of a proxy connection library.",
