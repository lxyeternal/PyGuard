{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer for a Python SOCKS proxy client library, importing internal components and defining the public API.",
  "sources": "Static imports from local modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto; no runtime data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely declarative setup.",
  "anomalies": "None; static code with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup, importing classes and functions, defining version and exports. It contains no runtime logic, network activity, or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard module initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, non-malicious component.",
