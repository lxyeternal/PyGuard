{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a proxy library, providing classes, errors, and helper functions for establishing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the __version__ string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that handle untrusted data or user input are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules, defines version, and exports symbols, without processing or passing data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of import statements, a version string, and an __all__ declaration for exports. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or other potentially unsafe actions. There are no sources of untrusted input, no sinks where data could leak or be exploited, and no evident flow of untrusted data. The structure is straightforward and aligns with standard Python module organization. The code appears to be a typical library interface setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module definition with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It serves as an interface for a proxy-related package and does not include any suspicious or harmful logic.",
