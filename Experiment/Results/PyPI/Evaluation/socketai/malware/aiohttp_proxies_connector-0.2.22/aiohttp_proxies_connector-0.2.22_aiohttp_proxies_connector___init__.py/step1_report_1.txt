{
  "purpose": "The code defines module exports for a SOCKS proxy client library, including imports of various components and setting up the module's API.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external communications are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports and exports setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements. The version number is straightforward. No dynamic code execution or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports classes and functions from local modules and declares module metadata and export variables. There is no indication of reading user input, network data, or performing any runtime operations that could be malicious. The version string is static. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious behavior are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module initialization script for a SOCKS proxy client library. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up the module's API and version information.",
