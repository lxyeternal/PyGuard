  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module setup: importing local components, defining version, and exporting symbols.\n- No untrusted data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The code appears to be an `__init__.py` or similar module setup for a SOCKS proxy client library.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware and obfuscation scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security risk scores:** Mostly 0, with one report giving a 0.1, likely due to the module's role in network operations, but since there's no actual network code here, this is minimal.\n- **Logic and reasoning:** All reports correctly identify that this code is purely structural and does not perform any malicious or insecure actions.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent in their assessments. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The only minor discrepancy is the one report assigning a security risk of 0.1, which might be slightly overcautious given the code snippet, but it's acceptable considering the module's purpose.\n\n**Risk scoring justification:**\n- Since the code does not perform any data handling, network operations, or dynamic execution, the risk scores should remain very low, close to 0.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that because the code is purely structural, it cannot be malicious. This is correct; however, if this module were part of a larger package that could be exploited, the overall risk might be higher. But based solely on this snippet, no such concern exists.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or 0.1 at most, but I would argue 0 is more accurate)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a benign, standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy client library. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident, and the assessments provided are consistent with this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- The scores are reasonable; I would keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- The risk score should be 0, given the lack of any security concerns in this code snippet.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Set the overall security risk score to 0.\n- Confirm that the code is safe and non-malicious based on the provided snippet.",
