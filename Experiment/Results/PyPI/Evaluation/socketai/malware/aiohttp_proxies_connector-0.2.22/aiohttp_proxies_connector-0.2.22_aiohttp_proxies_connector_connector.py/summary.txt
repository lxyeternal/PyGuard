  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a proxy connector with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary concern is the external create_socket_wrapper function, which should be reviewed separately for security. Overall, the code's security posture is low risk, with scores appropriately set at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a slight risk elevation due to external dependencies."
