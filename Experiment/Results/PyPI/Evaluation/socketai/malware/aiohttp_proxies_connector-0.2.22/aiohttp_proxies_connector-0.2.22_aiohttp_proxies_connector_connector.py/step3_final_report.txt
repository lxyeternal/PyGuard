  "purpose": "Provides an aiohttp proxy connector supporting HTTP/HTTPS proxies with optional rDNS and socket wrapping.",
  "sources": "Proxy configuration parameters, external functions create_socket_wrapper and parse_proxy_url, socket module, environment variables (if any), user inputs for proxy details.",
  "sinks": "Network socket connections, URL formation, proxy request updates, socket creation via external wrapper.",
  "flows": "Input proxy URL and parameters → parse_proxy_url → create_socket_wrapper (if non-HTTP proxy) → socket connection → request proxy update → establish connection.",
  "anomalies": "Reliance on external create_socket_wrapper function; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; standard code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard aiohttp proxy connector with configurable proxy types and optional rDNS. It constructs proxy URLs dynamically, uses an external socket wrapper for non-HTTP proxies, and manages connections appropriately. No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected. The main external dependency, create_socket_wrapper, could be a vector if malicious, but no evidence suggests malicious intent. The code's logic is straightforward, and the data flows are typical for such implementations. The risk is primarily associated with the external socket wrapper's trustworthiness. Scores are assigned as malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, reflecting low but non-zero concern due to external dependency.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a proxy connector with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary concern is the external create_socket_wrapper function, which should be reviewed separately for security. Overall, the code's security posture is low risk, with scores appropriately set at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a slight risk elevation due to external dependencies.",
