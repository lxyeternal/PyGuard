  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward aiohttp proxy connector supporting HTTP/HTTPS proxies, with optional rDNS, socket wrapping, and URL formation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The logic is standard, and the data flows are typical for such implementations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — reasonable given the straightforward nature.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing support for different proxy types, custom DNS resolution, and secure handling.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets. Socket handling appears standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — justified.\n- **Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on support for HTTP and non-HTTP proxies, with proxy URL construction and socket wrapping.\n- **Findings:** The main point of concern is the `create_socket_wrapper` function, which could be a vector for malicious behavior if maliciously implemented.\n- **Critical Point:** The code relies on an external function `create_socket_wrapper`. Its security depends on its implementation, which isn't provided. If this function is malicious or poorly implemented, it could introduce risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — conservative, assuming external functions are safe.\n- **Assessment:** While the code itself looks safe, the potential risk hinges on `create_socket_wrapper`. Without its implementation, we cannot fully rule out malicious behavior. However, in the absence of evidence, the report's conclusion that it appears safe is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on flexible proxy handling and no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes dynamic proxy URL construction, socket creation, and request header updates.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior or secrets. The reliance on external functions is noted but not deemed malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears legitimate and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Final Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's apparent purpose and lack of malicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 for some reports (0.1-0.2), justified by the reliance on external functions like `create_socket_wrapper`. The main concern is the potential for malicious implementation within such external functions, which isn't provided.\n\n**Important Note:** The primary potential security concern is the `create_socket_wrapper` function. If malicious or poorly implemented, it could introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. Since its implementation isn't available, the safest stance is to consider this as a low but non-zero risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to account for external function dependency)\n\nThis aligns with the overall assessment that the code is a standard, legitimate proxy connector implementation, with a minor concern related to external socket handling.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of an aiohttp proxy connector supporting various proxy types and configurations. No malicious or obfuscated code is evident. The main potential risk lies in the external `create_socket_wrapper` function, which should be reviewed for security if possible. Given the current information, the scores are justified and consistent.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2",
