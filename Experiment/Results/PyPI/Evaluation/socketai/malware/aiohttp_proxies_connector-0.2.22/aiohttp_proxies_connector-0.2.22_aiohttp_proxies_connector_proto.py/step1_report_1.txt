{
  "purpose": "The code implements asynchronous SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers to facilitate proxy connections and negotiations, including handling authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostnames, ports, user credentials, and potentially untrusted address inputs through function parameters such as host, port, username, password, and rdns flags.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over the network via sock_sendall, and address resolution results are obtained through getaddrinfo. The code also processes server responses and errors, which could potentially leak information if misused.",
  "flows": "Inputs (hostnames, credentials, address info) flow into address resolution and request construction, then data flows out via network socket operations such as sock_sendall and sock_recv, with server responses being parsed to determine success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious logic are evident. The code uses standard network operations and error handling. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present. The code appears to follow standard proxy connection procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly handles SOCKS proxy negotiation, including address resolution, authentication, and connection setup, without evident malicious modifications. It employs typical async socket operations and handles errors appropriately. No data exfiltration, malicious payload delivery, or hidden backdoors are detected. Usage of exceptions and input processing is standard. Overall, the code appears legitimate and secure in its intended function.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected operations for proxy connection and negotiation without suspicious or malicious code. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to proper handling of network data and credentials, which is standard for such modules.",
