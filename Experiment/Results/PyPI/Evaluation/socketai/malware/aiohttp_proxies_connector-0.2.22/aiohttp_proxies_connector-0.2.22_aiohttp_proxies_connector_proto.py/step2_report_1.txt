  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and considering the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers using asyncio.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The code performs expected address resolution, authentication, and connection procedures.\n- The malware scores are all 0, and obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no suspicion of malicious code.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in the code's function, mainly related to handling potentially sensitive data like credentials.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports find no malicious or suspicious code, and the code functions as intended for proxy connections.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None are evident. The code appears well-structured, standard, and correct.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2. These seem reasonable given the code's purpose and the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since no malicious activity or backdoors are detected, a malware score of 0 is appropriate across all reports.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs, so 0 is justified.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The risk score of 0.2 is low but acknowledges that handling network credentials and data could pose some minimal security considerations if misused. This seems appropriate.\n\n- **Potential discrepancies:**  \n  No discrepancies are evident. The reports are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign the following scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Slight inherent risk due to handling network credentials and data, but overall low.\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client wrapper. It does not contain any malicious logic, obfuscation, or backdoors. The low risk score appropriately reflects minimal security concerns, mainly related to proper handling of sensitive data.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are reasonable and justified given the code's functionality and the analysis. No changes are necessary.",
