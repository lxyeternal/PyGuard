{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, enabling connections through proxies with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Data sources include input parameters such as host, port, username, password, and data read from network sockets (sock_recv, getaddrinfo).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow into network requests sent via _send and into responses received via _receive and socket.recv().",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (host, port, credentials) through address resolution and into network requests; responses from the proxy server are read and processed for establishing connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious hardcoded secrets are present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. The code appears to handle network communication and proxy negotiation straightforwardly.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of asynchronous SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers using asyncio and socket modules. It manages connection setup, authentication, and response parsing, with error handling for common proxy errors. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden backdoors are evident. The code uses typical network programming patterns and proper exception handling. There are no suspicious external network connections or data leaks embedded within the code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asynchronous communication without any malicious intent. It follows conventional patterns and does not contain any malicious or sabotage code based on the analysis.",
