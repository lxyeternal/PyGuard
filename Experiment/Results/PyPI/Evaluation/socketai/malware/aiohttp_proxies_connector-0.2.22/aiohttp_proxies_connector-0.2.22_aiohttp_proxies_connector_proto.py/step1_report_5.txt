{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions to implement SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket connections using asyncio, allowing clients to connect through proxies with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "User-provided host and port inputs for destination and proxy addresses, data received from network socket reads, environment or configuration for proxy credentials.",
  "sinks": "Network socket send and receive operations, particularly _send, _receive, and connect methods that transmit or receive data over the network, including potentially sensitive data like credentials.",
  "flows": "Input from user or configuration (host, port, credentials) -> _build_dest_address or _socks_auth methods -> network socket send (_send) and receive (_receive) -> proxy negotiation -> destination connection.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, unusual variable names, or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code handles error cases explicitly and does not perform suspicious operations like system data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines asyncio-based SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connection classes, including methods for resolving addresses, authenticating (with optional username/password), and handling proxy responses. It includes standard error handling for network issues and proxy errors, using predefined error codes and exceptions. The credential handling appears limited to optional username/password for SOCKS5, and no hardcoded secrets or unusual data flows are detected. The network communication is direct and follows standard proxy protocols. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system command execution, or suspicious network activity are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of proxy socket wrappers with appropriate safeguards.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of asyncio-based SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections with proper error handling and optional authentication. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. It appears safe and focused solely on proxy negotiation and connection management.",
