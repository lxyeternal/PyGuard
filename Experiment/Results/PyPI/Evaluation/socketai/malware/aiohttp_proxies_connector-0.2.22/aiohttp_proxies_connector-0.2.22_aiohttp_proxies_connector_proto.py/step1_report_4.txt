{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS proxy client wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling asynchronous proxy connections with support for authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user-provided hostnames, ports, and optional credentials, as well as network responses received during negotiation.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows include sending connection requests, authentication credentials, and address data over the network, as well as receiving responses from the proxy server.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input (host, port, credentials) through address resolution and socket connection, then through negotiation steps involving sending and receiving protocol-specific requests and responses.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain obvious malicious or backdoor code; it primarily handles proxy negotiation. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network behaviors are present. No obfuscated code, code injection, or data exfiltration routines are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for establishing SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections in an asynchronous manner. It performs standard address resolution, protocol negotiation, and optional authentication. All data exchanges are typical for proxy protocols and are limited to connection setup procedures. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network communications are present. Error handling is consistent with expected proxy behaviors. The code adheres to normal patterns for proxy client implementations without unusual or covert activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio-based Python applications. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware within this module. It responsibly manages network connections, resolves addresses, and negotiates proxy protocols without suspicious behavior.",
