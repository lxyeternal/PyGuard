  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The code implements SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy clients, handling address resolution, authentication, and network communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Standard network operations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, secure, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears standard and benign. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on SOCKS proxy connections with address resolution and authentication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. Uses typical patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, no malicious intent, high confidence (0.9). Malware score: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns; code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Implements SOCKS proxy connection with optional credentials, handling address resolution and proxy negotiation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Proper error handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, secure, with high confidence (0.95). Malware score: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Looks safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar SOCKS proxy wrappers with proper handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard, safe, high confidence (0.95). Malware score: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** As above, with focus on connection setup and optional credentials.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Proper error handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, straightforward implementation, high confidence (0.9). Malware score: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code snippets are consistent across reports and show standard implementations of SOCKS proxy clients.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors, backdoors, or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores & Justification:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis. The security risk scores are low (~0.2), which is reasonable given the nature of proxy client code handling potentially sensitive data (credentials, addresses), but no malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (standard risk level for network code handling credentials and address resolution)\n\n**Note:** The code's purpose is to facilitate proxy connections; it does not contain any signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malware. Proper security practices should still be followed when deploying such code, especially regarding credential management.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The provided scores are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
