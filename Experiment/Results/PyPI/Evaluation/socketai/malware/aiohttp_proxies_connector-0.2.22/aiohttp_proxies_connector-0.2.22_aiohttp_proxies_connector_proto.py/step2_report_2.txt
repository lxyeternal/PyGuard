  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements async SOCKS4/5 proxy wrappers, handling authentication, address resolution, and connection setup. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity. The low risk score reflects minimal security concern, primarily about correct handling of credentials and network data.\n- **Justification for scores:** The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code isn't obfuscated. The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, given the potential for misconfiguration or credential mishandling but no active threats.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard SOCKS proxy implementation with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's nature. No suspicious patterns or malicious logic are present.\n- **Justification:** Same reasoning as above. The low risk score is appropriate, and malware/obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS4/5 proxy wrappers, with input parameters for host, port, credentials, and address resolution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. The low risk score remains justified.\n- **Justification:** The scores are consistent; no malicious or obfuscated code is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; standard async SOCKS proxy client classes, handling address resolution and authentication.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the code performs expected proxy functions without malicious intent.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score is appropriate, and no malware or obfuscation is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements SOCKS proxy wrappers with address resolution and optional authentication, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies the code as standard, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Justification:** The scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network behaviors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, matching the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Uniformly 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern primarily related to correct handling of credentials and network data.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n- The overall assessment indicates this is a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard network handling, minor concerns about credential management and error handling, but nothing active or dangerous)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, secure SOCKS proxy client implementation with negligible security risks.",
