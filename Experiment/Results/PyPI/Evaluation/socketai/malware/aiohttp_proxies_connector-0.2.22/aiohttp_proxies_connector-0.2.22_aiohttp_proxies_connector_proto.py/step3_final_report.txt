  "purpose": "Implementation of asynchronous SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers with support for address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation.",
  "sources": "Host and port inputs for proxy server and destination, credentials for authentication, address resolution functions.",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations for connecting, sending, and receiving data; potential data leakage if credentials are mishandled.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, credentials) are processed through address resolution and authentication routines, then used to establish network connections via sockets.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Code follows standard patterns for proxy communication.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers using asyncio, with proper error handling, address resolution, and optional authentication. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The security considerations involve handling credentials and network data, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the context of network operations and credential handling.",
