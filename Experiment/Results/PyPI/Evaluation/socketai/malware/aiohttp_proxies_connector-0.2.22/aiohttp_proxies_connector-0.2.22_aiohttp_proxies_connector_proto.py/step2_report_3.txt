  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence, reasoning, and scores, to determine if they are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements standard async SOCKS4/5 proxy wrappers with proper handling; no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code appears legitimate, following standard protocols.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n- The risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable, given the potential for misuse if credentials are compromised, but not inherently malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are consistent with the analysis. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard implementation, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Same reasoning applies; the code is a typical SOCKS proxy client.\n- No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n- Risk score remains appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy wrappers, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent with previous assessments.\n- Slightly higher confidence, but no evidence of issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy implementation, no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Similar reasoning; no signs of malicious activity.\n- The risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Straightforward SOCKS proxy code, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code appears secure, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.\n- The risk score remains appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports consistently identify the code as standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy wrappers.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The risk scores of 0.2 are reasonable, considering the potential misuse if credentials are compromised, but no inherent malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all, as the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 remains appropriate, reflecting minimal inherent risk.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe reports are accurate and well-justified; no adjustments are necessary.",
