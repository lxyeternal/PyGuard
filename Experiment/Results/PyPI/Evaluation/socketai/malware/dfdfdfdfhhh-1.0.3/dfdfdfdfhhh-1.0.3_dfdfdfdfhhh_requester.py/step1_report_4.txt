{
  "purpose": "Defines a class named 'send' and prints 'Hi' immediately upon loading.",
  "sources": "The code reads nothing from external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to standard output via print statement; no untrusted data is sent or leaked.",
  "flows": "No data flows from any source to a sink; the print statement executes during class definition.",
  "anomalies": "The class contains only a print statement, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no code execution or data handling anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with no methods or attributes and executes a print statement at class scope. It does not process or handle external data, nor does it perform any network or system operations. The print statement may be considered unconventional inside a class, but it poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign; it simply defines a class and outputs a message during module load. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
