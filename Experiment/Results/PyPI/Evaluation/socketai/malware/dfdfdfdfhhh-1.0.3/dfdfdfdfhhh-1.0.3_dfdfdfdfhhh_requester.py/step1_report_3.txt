  "purpose": "Define a class named 'send' and print a greeting message.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No output sinks, data leaks, or untrusted data usage observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply prints a message during class definition.",
  "anomalies": "Class definition with a print statement at the top level; unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, no code injection, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'send' and immediately executes a print statement during class declaration. There are no inputs, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. The print statement is benign and does not involve any data leakage or malicious activity. Overall, the code is minimal and harmless, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple class definition with an immediate print statement. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The print statement executes upon class definition but does not pose any security threat.",
