{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package with custom installation behavior that executes embedded code during installation.",
  "sources": "The embedded base64-encoded string decoded and executed in the CustomInstallCommand.run() method.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decoded code that contains potential network requests, system commands, or other malicious activities.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, decoding base64-encoded payload, executing the payload which may perform malicious actions, and then proceeding with the setup process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and exec() to run hidden code during installation; presence of heavily obfuscated code that loads and runs external or malicious scripts; lack of transparency in code behavior; embedding potentially malicious code in setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines a custom installation command. Within this custom command, it imports base64, then decodes a long base64 string, and executes the decoded code with exec(). The decoded code appears to import several modules, perform network requests, and possibly execute malicious actions. The code is heavily obfuscated, likely to hide malicious intent. The presence of dynamic execution during installation strongly suggests malicious behavior, such as retrieving additional payloads or exfiltrating data. The setup function proceeds with normal package setup but the embedded code execution during install indicates a supply chain attack or backdoor. The obfuscation and hidden code strongly imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains a malicious backdoor that executes obfuscated code during installation, likely to perform unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration or system compromise. The obfuscated code and use of exec() with base64-encoded payload pose significant security risks.",
