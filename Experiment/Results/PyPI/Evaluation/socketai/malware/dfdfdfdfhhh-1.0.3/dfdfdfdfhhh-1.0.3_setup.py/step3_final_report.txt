{
  "purpose": "The code executes heavily obfuscated base64-encoded payload during installation, likely for malicious purposes such as remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "The `run()` method in `CustomInstallCommand` reads the base64 string and imports `base64` module.",
  "sinks": "The `exec()` function executes the decoded payload, which may perform network requests, system modifications, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The code imports `base64`, decodes the long string, and passes it directly to `exec()`, executing potentially malicious code during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of the payload, use of `exec()` on decoded code, and execution during package install are suspicious and indicative of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, during execution, imports `base64`, decodes a large obfuscated string, and executes it with `exec()`. The payload is heavily encoded, which is a common tactic to hide malicious activities such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors. The use of `exec()` on decoded code during installation is a significant red flag, indicating potential malicious behavior. The high obfuscation level and execution pattern align with known supply chain attack vectors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=1, obfuscated=0.9-1, securityRisk=1) are justified given the evidence of malicious intent and the potential for system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a heavily obfuscated payload executed during installation, which strongly suggests malicious behavior. The pattern of executing hidden code during package setup is a classic indicator of supply chain compromise. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified. This package should be flagged, further analyzed, and avoided to prevent potential security breaches.",
