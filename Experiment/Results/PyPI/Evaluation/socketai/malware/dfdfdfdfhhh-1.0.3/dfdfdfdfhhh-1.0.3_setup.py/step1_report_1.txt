{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package with specific metadata and a custom installation command that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata (e.g., version, description), and the custom install command imports modules and executes embedded base64-decoded code.",
  "sinks": "The obfuscated code executed during installation can act as a sink, potentially performing malicious actions such as network communication or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Source: installation script and imported modules → Obfuscated base64 code decoded and executed during 'run' method → Potential malicious actions depending on the decoded content.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an obfuscated base64 string that is decoded and executed at install time, which is suspicious. The use of 'exec' with decoded code is a strong anomaly. Additionally, the code attempts to import modules and perform operations without clear purpose, and the obfuscated code seems to involve network or system operations.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package and defines a custom installation command that, when run, imports 'base64' and executes a base64-decoded script via 'exec'. The decoded script appears to be heavily obfuscated, with multiple layers of encoding and a pattern typical of malicious code designed to hide its true intent. The decoded payload, based on the presence of URLs, network operations, and the obfuscation pattern, suggests it could be executing malicious actions during installation, such as connecting to remote servers or performing unwanted system modifications. The rest of the setup code appears benign and standard for package setup, but the inclusion of the obfuscated execution is highly suspicious and indicates potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior in the form of executing obfuscated payload during installation, which could lead to system compromise or data exfiltration. The presence of an encoded and executed script is a strong indicator of malicious intent, making this package highly dangerous for use.",
