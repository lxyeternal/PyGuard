{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, including a custom installation command that executes obfuscated base64-decoded code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the obfuscated base64 string within the CustomInstallCommand.run() method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decoded code using exec(), which can run arbitrary code, and the use of the exec() function itself.",
  "flows": "The setup script calls CustomInstallCommand.run() during installation, which decodes and executes obfuscated code, potentially executing malicious code during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated base64-encoded code decoded and executed via exec(), which is suspicious. The code within the base64 string appears to include malicious patterns such as network requests, possible data exfiltration, and hidden backdoor activities. The code also contains unusual import statements, dynamic execution, and encoded payloads. The purpose seems to be to hide malicious activity during the package installation process.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, but it contains a custom installation command that, upon execution, imports base64, then decodes and executes a large obfuscated payload. The payload, once decoded, contains code that appears to perform malicious activities such as sending data over the network, executing system commands, and potentially exfiltrating user data. The use of exec() with decoded code from base64 is a common technique to hide malicious behavior. No benign functionality is evident in this payload; it strongly indicates malicious intent. The rest of the script, such as package metadata, appears normal and unrelated to the malicious payload. The pattern of obfuscation and the payload’s content suggest this is a supply chain attack, attempting to hide malicious code inside a seemingly legitimate package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes malicious code embedded within an obfuscated payload that executes during installation, representing a supply chain security threat. The intent appears to be to run hidden malicious activities when the package is installed, likely for malicious data exfiltration or system compromise. The overall security risk is high due to this hidden malicious behavior.",
