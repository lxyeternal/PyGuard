  "conclusion": "The code contains a heavily obfuscated payload executed during installation, which strongly suggests malicious behavior. The pattern of executing hidden code during package setup is a classic indicator of supply chain compromise. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified. This package should be flagged, further analyzed, and avoided to prevent potential security breaches."
