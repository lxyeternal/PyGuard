{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with custom installation behavior that includes executing obfuscated code.",
  "sources": "Code reads external modules (setuptools, base64), and within CustomInstallCommand.run() it imports base64, then executes base64-decoded code embedded as a string.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executes decoded code, which could run malicious or unauthorized commands, including network or system actions.",
  "flows": "import base64 -> decode string -> execute decoded code with exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on a base64-decoded string is highly suspicious, especially as the decoded content contains obfuscated and possibly malicious code. The code is heavily encoded and includes references to network requests, potentially to malicious servers, and includes hidden strings and obfuscated imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for package setup and defines a custom install command 'CustomInstallCommand'. Within its run() method, it imports 'base64' and executes a base64-encoded string using exec(). The encoded string decodes to complex, obfuscated Python code that appears to perform network requests, possibly to malicious domains, and includes numerous suspicious elements like encoded scripts, encoded URLs, and hidden commands. This indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity, possibly to perform unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, command execution, or malicious network communication during installation. The rest of the setup code seems benign, merely setting package metadata and dependencies. The inclusion of obfuscated code that executes during installation is a significant red flag for malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated, encoded code that executes during installation, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent. The use of exec() on decoded code with network activity and obfuscated strings strongly suggests malicious behavior designed to run hidden scripts or connect to malicious servers during install.",
