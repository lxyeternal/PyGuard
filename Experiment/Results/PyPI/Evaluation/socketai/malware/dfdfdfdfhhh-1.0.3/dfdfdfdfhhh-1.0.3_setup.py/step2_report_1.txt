  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n### **General Observations Across Reports:**\n\n- All reports identify the presence of a heavily obfuscated base64 string decoded and executed via `exec()` during the custom install command.\n- The decoded payload appears to perform network operations, possibly malicious.\n- The use of `exec()` on decoded code is a significant red flag.\n- The reports assign high confidence (0.9) and malware scores (0.9 or 1) consistently.\n- The obfuscation levels are high, with some noting heavy encoding and multiple layers.\n\n---\n\n### **Specific Review of Each Report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** The script executes obfuscated code during installation.\n- **Analysis:** The decoded code seems to involve network communication, possibly malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Strong suspicion of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=1, obfuscated=1, securityRisk=1.  \n**Assessment:** The high scores are justified given the code behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** The decoded code appears to perform network requests, exfiltration, or similar malicious activities.\n- **Conclusion:** The package contains a malicious backdoor.\n- **Scores:** malware=1, obfuscated=1, securityRisk=1.  \n**Assessment:** The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Similar setup with obfuscated code execution.\n- **Analysis:** The decoded payload seems to include network requests and hidden commands.\n- **Conclusion:** Malicious intent strongly indicated.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.9, obfuscated=0.9, securityRisk=0.9.  \n**Assessment:** Slightly lower than 1, but still very high; justified given the suspicious pattern.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern.\n- **Analysis:** The decoded code appears to perform network communication, exfiltration, or backdoor activities.\n- **Conclusion:** Malicious code embedded, high security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=1, obfuscated=0.9, securityRisk=1.  \n**Assessment:** The high malware score is justified. Slightly lower obfuscated score (0.9) makes sense if some parts are less obfuscated, but overall the suspicion remains high.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Similar setup.\n- **Analysis:** The heavily obfuscated code executes during install, with potential for malicious network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** High suspicion of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.9, obfuscated=0.8, securityRisk=0.9.  \n**Assessment:** Slightly lower obfuscated score (0.8) possibly due to some visible patterns, but overall consistent with malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The obfuscated base64 string and `exec()` are confirmed in all reports.\n- **Malicious behavior:** All reports reasonably assign a malware score of 0.9 or 1, justified by the obfuscated execution pattern and potential network activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** Scores of 0.8 to 1 are appropriate given the heavy encoding.\n- **Risk scores:** High, with most at 1, justified due to the potential for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Evaluation & Final Estimations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Given the consistent pattern of obfuscated code executed during installation, and the typical malicious intent associated with such patterns, **a malware score of 1** is appropriate for the overall assessment.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is heavily obfuscated, so **a score of 1** would be justified, but some reports assign slightly lower (0.8-0.9) possibly due to some visible patterns or partial deobfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** The potential for remote code execution, backdoors, and supply chain compromise warrants **a risk score of 1**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The code is **malicious** and should be treated as a supply chain attack.\n- The obfuscation and execution pattern are typical of malicious backdoors.\n- **Package should be flagged, and further analysis or removal is advised.**\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Metric            | Final Estimated Score |\n|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware           | **1.0**              |\n| Obfuscated        | **1.0**              |\n| Security Risk     | **1.0**              |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence of malicious obfuscated code executed during installation, which can lead to severe security implications.",
