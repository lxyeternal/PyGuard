{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package that mimics urllib functionality. It includes a custom installation script that executes embedded base64-decoded code.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the base64-encoded string inside the CustomInstallCommand.run() method.",
  "sinks": "The decoded code is executed with exec(), which is a critical sink capable of executing arbitrary code. This could lead to malicious behavior if the decoded code is harmful.",
  "flows": "The source is the base64-encoded string within the run() method; it is decoded and executed via exec(), creating a flow from encoded string to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The use of base64 decoding and dynamic execution (exec) is suspicious, especially within a setup script. The decoded code appears to import modules, create objects, and execute code dynamically, which can be malicious. The code also contains obfuscated and encoded segments, hinting at obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines package metadata and a custom install command. In the CustomInstallCommand.run() method, it imports base64 and then executes a line of code that is base64-decoded. The decoded string is a complex, obfuscated Python script that imports modules, creates objects, and appears to perform network requests and other actions. The presence of exec() with decoded code is highly suspicious, indicating potential malicious intent such as executing hidden code during installation. The rest of the setup code seems benign, with standard package configuration. The embedded code is heavily obfuscated, further raising suspicion of malicious behavior, such as covert network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor creation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious payload embedded as an obfuscated base64 string that is decoded and executed during installation. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicates a probable malicious intent, such as executing arbitrary code on installation. The overall security risk is high, and the package should not be used.",
