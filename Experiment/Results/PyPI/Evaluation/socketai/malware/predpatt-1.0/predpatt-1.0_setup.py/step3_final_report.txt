{
  "purpose": "The source code is designed to perform malicious data exfiltration during package installation by collecting system information and sending it to an external server without user consent.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' for IP, 'os.uname()[1]' for hostname, and 'requests.utils.quote' for path; reading and writing to local file 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "sinks": "External server 'https://kotko.org' with base64-encoded data via GET request; local file 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "flows": "System info (IP, hostname, path) is gathered, encoded in base64, then transmitted to external server; proof message written locally.",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration occurs during setup via a registered atexit hook; the '_post_install' function is commented out, possibly inactive unless invoked elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly performs data collection and exfiltration during package installation, using requests to send system info to a suspicious domain. The activity is straightforward, not obfuscated, and indicates malicious intent. The function registration with atexit suggests an attempt to hide activity post-install. The commented-out invocation reduces immediate risk but does not negate the malicious design. The scores of 0.9 for malware and security risk are justified if the function executes; if not, the risk diminishes somewhat. Overall, the code demonstrates high malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains clear malicious behavior involving silent data exfiltration during installation. The high scores reflect the severity of this activity. The code is not obfuscated but is intentionally designed to steal system information without user consent.",
