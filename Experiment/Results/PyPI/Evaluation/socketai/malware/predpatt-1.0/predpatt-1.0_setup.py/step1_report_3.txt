{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, primarily used for packaging and distribution via PyPI. It also includes a post-installation routine that performs network requests and writes to a file.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, requesting external IP via 'https://api.ipify.org', accessing system hostname via 'os.uname()', and potentially reading local file paths.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'pocbykotko.txt', sending encoded data to 'https://kotko.org', and requesting URL 'https://kotko.org?google-research/language=...' with base64-encoded data.",
  "flows": "The code reads the README.md and system info, encodes data, writes a proof string to a file, then sends collected info (IP, hostname, path) encoded in base64 as a GET request parameter to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "The '_post_install' function performs data collection and exfiltration of system information to an external server upon package installation. The network request to 'https://kotko.org' with encoded system data is suspicious, indicating possible data exfiltration. The code also writes a seemingly harmless proof message to a local file.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a custom installation class that registers a post-install routine '_post_install'. This routine collects local system info and external IP address, encodes it, and sends it via a GET request to an external domain. The data collection and network transmission occur automatically during installation, which is unusual behavior for a standard package. The code uses 'requests' for network operations and performs encoding with 'base64'. The initial import statements and setup configuration appear typical for a Python package, but the embedded network activity and data exfiltration logic are malicious or at least highly suspicious. No other malicious activities such as system damage, privilege escalation, or backdoors are present, but the exfiltration aspect is a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior intended for data exfiltration during installation. It secretly collects system information, encodes it, and transmits it to an external server, violating user privacy and security. The core setup functionality appears normal, but the embedded post-install code is malicious.",
