  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that includes a post-installation process which sends system and network information to an external URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for description, reads the current script path, retrieves system information via os.uname(), and makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs (api.ipify.org and kotko.org). It also writes to a local file 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "sinks": "The code performs network requests that send system info and encoded data to external domains (kotko.org). It also writes to a local file. The requests could be used to exfiltrate data.",
  "flows": "Input sources include reading the README.md, obtaining system info via os.uname(), fetching IP address from api.ipify.org, and encoding system info into base64. The data flows through encoding and is sent via HTTP GET request to kotko.org. Also, the script writes a proof message to a local file.",
  "anomalies": "The post-install function (_post_install) runs automatically upon installation, performs network requests to external domains with encoded system data, and writes a proof message to a local file. These actions are unusual for a standard setup script and suggest potential malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes standard package metadata and dependencies. However, it defines a custom install class that registers a post-install hook (_post_install). The _post_install function writes to a local file 'pocbykotko.txt' and retrieves the machine's public IP address from api.ipify.org. It then constructs a message with system info, encodes it in base64, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain 'kotko.org'. These actions could be used for system profiling or data exfiltration. The use of the post-install hook to perform network activity and file modification is atypical and suspicious, especially since it contacts an external domain with encoded system info.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior patterns, including exfiltration of system data via encoded requests during package installation. The network activity and file modification are unusual for a standard setup script and suggest intent to gather or transmit user/system information without clear disclosure. Given these observations, the code should be considered malicious or potentially harmful.",
