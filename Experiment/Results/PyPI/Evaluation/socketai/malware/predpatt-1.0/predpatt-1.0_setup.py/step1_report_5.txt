{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, including custom installation behavior that involves making network requests and writing to files.",
  "sources": "Network requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org', reading the current file path, reading 'README.md', and writing to 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs (potential data exfiltration), writing to local files, base64 encoding of data, and executing network GET requests with potentially sensitive data.",
  "flows": "During installation, the '_post_install' function is invoked, which collects system information, encodes it, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external domain. Additionally, it appends a string to a local file.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes network calls that send system IP and hostname information to a suspicious domain ('kotko.org') without user consent. It also writes a proof string to a local file ('pocbykotko.txt') during installation. The '_post_install' function is registered via 'atexit' but is commented out, implying it may be inactive unless explicitly called.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with a custom install command. The '_post_install' function, if executed, performs potentially malicious activities: it retrieves the system's public IP address, local hostname, and path, encodes this information, and transmits it to an external server ('kotko.org') without any user permission. It also writes a string 'proof bug by kotko' to a local file, which could serve as a marker or backdoor indicator. The network communication could be used for tracking, data collection, or command and control activities. However, the '_post_install' function is commented out at the bottom, so unless invoked explicitly, it may not execute during standard installation. There is no evidence of obfuscated code or binary malware. Overall, the code contains suspicious behavior related to data exfiltration and unauthorized system information collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be malicious or at least suspicious due to its data collection and transmission activities, which are common in malware and spyware. However, since the potentially malicious function is commented out and not automatically executed, the actual risk depends on whether '_post_install' is invoked elsewhere. The network activity and file write are concerning indicators of potential malware behavior. The code does not seem obfuscated or contain hidden backdoors explicitly, but its intent to exfiltrate system info without user consent raises security concerns.",
