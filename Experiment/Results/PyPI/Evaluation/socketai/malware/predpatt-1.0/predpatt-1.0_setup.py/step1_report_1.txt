{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, including custom post-install behavior that collects system information and exfiltrates it to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the README.md file, makes HTTP requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org', and accesses system information via os.uname() and __file__.",
  "sinks": "The code sends system information (IP, hostname, path) encoded in base64 to an external server ('https://kotko.org'). It also writes to a local file 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "flows": "Reads the README.md content -> During installation, invokes _post_install -> makes HTTP GET requests to external servers -> encodes system info in base64 -> sends data via HTTP GET request -> writes to local file.",
  "anomalies": "The _post_install function is registered during package installation, which executes code that exfiltrates system info to an external domain. The URL 'https://kotko.org' is suspicious and not related to the package's functionality. The code writes a proof string to a local file and retrieves system IP and hostname without any user consent prompts. No input validation or safeguards are present.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom 'new_install' class that registers '_post_install' to run after installation. The '_post_install' function collects local system info, encodes it in base64, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a potentially malicious domain. It also appends a string 'proof bug by kotko' to a local file. There are no user prompts or configuration checks, meaning this behavior occurs silently during package installation. The code uses the 'requests' library to communicate with external servers, and the collected data includes IP address, hostname, and install path, all potentially sensitive information. The code appears to be designed to surreptitiously gather and exfiltrate system data, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior: during installation, it exfiltrates system data to an external server without user consent, writes a proof string to a local file, and operates hidden behind the setup process. This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious.",
