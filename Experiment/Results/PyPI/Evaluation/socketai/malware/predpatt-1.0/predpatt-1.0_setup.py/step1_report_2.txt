{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, primarily used to configure package metadata, dependencies, and installation behavior. It includes custom installation logic that executes during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the filesystem (README.md, the current script's directory), environment variables (os.uname()), and makes network requests (requests.get to fetch external IP and to send data to a suspicious URL). It also reads input data such as the README content.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org' transmit system information. The data is base64-encoded and sent as a GET parameter, potentially exposing system data to external parties. File operations include appending to 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "flows": "System information (IP, hostname, path) is gathered and encoded, then transmitted to an external server. The file 'pocbykotko.txt' is appended with a proof message. These data flows involve collecting local system info and exfiltrating it over the network.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration without user consent, sending system IP, hostname, and path to an external URL. It also writes a proof string to a local file ('pocbykotko.txt'), which may indicate malicious testing or backdoor setup. The code is embedded within a setup script, disguising its malicious intent as part of package installation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup file for a Python package that includes a custom installation class. During installation, it registers a post-install hook that executes '_post_install'. This function creates or appends to 'pocbykotko.txt', then collects system IP, hostname, and current script path. It encodes this info in base64 and sends it via a GET request to 'kotko.org', potentially for data harvesting. The use of 'requests' for data exfiltration, combined with writing to a local file with a suspicious name, indicates malicious intent. All network activity is performed during package installation, which is a common tactic for stealthy data collection. The code uses legitimate libraries but combines them in a way that facilitates covert information leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior aimed at exfiltrating system information to an external server during package installation. It also writes a proof message to a local file. These actions suggest a backdoor or tracking functionality embedded within the setup process, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
