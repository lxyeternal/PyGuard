  "purpose": "Custom installation process that gathers system information and exfiltrates it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname, current working directory, username, and listing directory contents in /, /root/, /home/, and /root/.ssh/.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to https://j0j0.xyz/lists/ with system data, and creating an empty file at /root/j0j0.poc.",
  "flows": "Data collected from system info sources flows into the 'ploads' dictionary, which is then sent via an HTTP POST request to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code writes an empty file at /root/j0j0.poc without validation and exfiltrates directory listings and hostname data to an external server. The URL used is suspicious, and the purpose appears to be stealthy data collection.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard setup.py process with a custom install command that executes system information gathering and exfiltration during installation. It collects hostname, current directory, username, and directory listings of critical system folders. These data points are assembled into a dictionary and sent over HTTP POST to an external server, indicating data exfiltration. Additionally, it creates an empty file at /root/j0j0.poc, which may be a marker or trigger. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, potentially hiding failures. The external URL appears suspicious, suggesting malicious intent. No obfuscated code or complex obfuscation techniques are present. Overall, the code performs covert data collection and exfiltration during installation, characteristic of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent by collecting sensitive system information and exfiltrating it to an external server during package installation. It also creates a file in the root directory, which may serve as a marker. The external URL and data collection methods are suspicious, indicating this package could be used for malicious purposes.",
