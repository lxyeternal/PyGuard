{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information and directory listings during installation, then exfiltrates this data to a suspicious external URL, indicating malicious intent for covert data theft.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname, current working directory, username, and directory listings from '/', '/root/', '/home/', '/root/.ssh/'; creating a file at '/root/j0j0.poc'.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to 'https://j0j0.xyz/lists/' transmitting collected data.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info and directory listings) are gathered during the run() method and then sent directly via the requests.post call to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional creation of a file in '/root/', suppression of errors with try-except blocks, and exfiltration during package installation without user consent or notification.",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert collection of sensitive system information and directory listings, then exfiltrates this data to a suspicious URL during package installation. It creates a file in a protected directory, suppresses errors to avoid detection, and uses straightforward code without obfuscation. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious supply chain attacks, aimed at stealthy data theft. The exfiltration endpoint is suspicious, and the actions occur silently during setup, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including covert data exfiltration and stealthy file creation, during package installation. The behavior aligns with supply chain sabotage or data theft, warranting a high malware and security risk score.",
