{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to install a Python package named '11Cent' with a custom installation process that exfiltrates system information.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, username, and directory listings of '/', '/root/', '/home/', and '/root/.ssh/'",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via an HTTP POST request to 'https://j0j0.xyz/lists/'",
  "flows": "System information (hostname, cwd, username, directory listings) collected at install time flows from source variables to the data payload, then sent over the network to an external server",
  "anomalies": "Unusual activity includes the collection of multiple directory listings and sending them to an external server during package installation. The code attempts to write a file '/root/j0j0.poc' and performs network exfiltration without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the installation process by extending the 'install' command. During installation, it gathers sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current directory, and directory contents of critical paths. It then sends this data to an external URL via an HTTP POST request. The code does not perform any validation or sanitization, and the URL indicates potential malicious intent (exfiltration). The writing of a file in '/root/' and directory listing collection are suspicious behaviors typically associated with reconnaissance or backdoor activities. No obfuscation is present, but the intent to silently collect and exfiltrate data during package installation is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating sensitive system information during package installation. The data collection and transmission happen covertly, indicating a potential supply chain attack or backdoor. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
