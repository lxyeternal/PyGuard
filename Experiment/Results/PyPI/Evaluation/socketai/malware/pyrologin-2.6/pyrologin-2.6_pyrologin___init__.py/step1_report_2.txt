{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of terminal manipulation utilities, including color formatting, cursor control, text positioning, animations, and banner drawing functions for terminal applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from user inputs (via input()), terminal size, and system commands. It also accesses environment information like OS name for conditional logic.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include system commands executed via System.Command(), print outputs, and user inputs. No evidence of untrusted data being used maliciously; system commands are limited to terminal control functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input or system states to display functions, but no explicit untrusted data is directed toward system commands or network operations. Most functions are for formatting and terminal control.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network connections are present. The code does not obfuscate or dynamically generate malicious code. The comments and variable names are benign. The code is extensive but appears to be a terminal UI toolkit without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code includes terminal manipulation functions such as clearing the screen, hiding/showing cursor, setting window title, and resizing. It offers text coloring with static and dynamic colors, text animations like fading and moving, and banner/drawing utilities. No network activity, file manipulation, or external resource access that could be malicious is evident. It also does not include code injection, reverse shells, or data theft mechanisms. The presence of threading for animations is for UI effects only. Overall, the code functions as a sophisticated terminal UI toolkit without signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a comprehensive terminal UI utility library providing visual effects, text formatting, and layout functions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The code is well-structured for terminal manipulation purposes and contains no malicious signals.",
