{
  "purpose": "The code provides terminal UI utilities, including color handling, text formatting, animations, and system commands, aimed at creating styled console outputs and animations.",
  "sources": "Input functions from user (e.g., input()), terminal size functions, shell commands (System.Command()), and text content from parameters.",
  "sinks": "System shell commands (System.Command, System.Size, System.Title), standard output for printing animations and formatted text, and input prompts.",
  "flows": "User input can be read via input(), which can influence behavior in Animation, Write, and other functions. Terminal commands can be executed via System.Command. Animated text functions write to stdout, potentially influenced by external input. No external data sources or network activities are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code includes functions that manipulate terminal cursor visibility, colors, and animations; these are standard for styled console applications. There is an unimplemented placeholder in Colors.DynamicRGB, and some color definitions (e.g., red_to_blue, red_to_green, etc.) are incomplete, but this alone is not malicious. No obfuscation or concealment mechanisms are present. The code appears to be for aesthetic terminal effects rather than malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a comprehensive set of terminal manipulation utilities, including color handling, text formatting, cursor control, and animations. It uses standard modules (os, sys, time, threading) for terminal operations, system commands, and threading. No code sends data over the network, writes to system files, or executes suspicious commands. Functions like System.Command() allow executing shell commands, but are standard in terminal tools. There are no indications of hidden backdoors, credential theft, or malicious data exfiltration. The placeholder variables in Colors (e.g., red_to_blue) are not used maliciously. The code's purpose appears to be aesthetic terminal enhancement rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a terminal styling and animation library with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It mainly manipulates terminal display and colors, with standard system commands, and does not perform any harmful operations such as data theft, network communications, or backdoor creation. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for aesthetic terminal effects.",
