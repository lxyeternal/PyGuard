  "purpose": "A comprehensive terminal UI toolkit providing colors, animations, layout, and system control functions for aesthetic and interactive terminal applications.",
  "sources": "System calls (_system), user input, terminal size info, string parameters, threading for animations",
  "sinks": "System commands for terminal management, stdout writes for display, user input collection",
  "flows": "System info and commands flow to terminal control; user input flows into input functions; stdout writes display output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code; incomplete placeholder functions but no malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code is a feature-rich terminal UI library with functions for colors, animations, layout, and system commands. It uses system calls for terminal control, threading for animations, and standard input/output. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The use of system commands could pose a risk if misused externally, but within this code, no malicious activity is present. The code is transparent, well-structured, and designed for aesthetic and functional terminal enhancements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign terminal UI toolkit with no malicious intent or behavior. It relies on standard system calls and threading for visual effects. The low malware score (0) and obfuscated score (0) are appropriate. The security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects minimal potential misuse if external code improperly invokes system commands, but no actual malicious activity is detected.",
