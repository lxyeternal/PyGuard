  "conclusion": "The code exhibits indicators of malicious activity, primarily due to execution of an obfuscated, potentially malicious PowerShell command during setup, with masked errors and external URL references. Scores of malware (0.85), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.85) are justified. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
