{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package with a custom installation step that performs a potentially malicious action during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.name), imports requests and fernet modules, executes encrypted code via Fernet decryption during the install command.",
  "sinks": "Executes decrypted code with exec(), which can run arbitrary code, potentially malicious.",
  "flows": "The install.run() method triggers execution of decrypted code, which is executed via exec() during the installation process, enabling arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a large, seemingly random string as a variable and function names that are nonsensical; encrypted code being decrypted and executed dynamically; usage of exec() with decrypted content; encrypted payload appears designed to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package with a custom install command class. The custom run() method checks if the OS is Windows, then imports requests and Fernet, and decrypts an encrypted payload that is executed via exec(). The encrypted payload likely contains malicious code that runs at install time, representing a significant security risk. The rest of the setup configuration appears standard but includes obfuscated and suspicious code behavior. The use of dynamic decryption and execution is a common technique to hide malicious payloads. The package metadata does not match typical naming conventions and includes random strings, adding to suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated malicious behavior, notably decrypting and executing hidden code during installation, which can lead to arbitrary system compromise. The overall security risk is high due to the dynamic, encrypted execution of code at install time.",
