{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'reqirements' with specific metadata and custom installation behavior. It includes obfuscated class and variable names, likely to hide malicious intent, and executes remote-encoded code during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading package setup configuration, importing modules, and reading environment variables",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, importing 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, potentially retrieving remote data or code execution",
  "flows": "During install, if OS is Windows, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypts a payload with Fernet, then executes the payload via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, use of 'exec()' with decrypted payload, inclusion of potentially malicious code execution step during installation, hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload, no clear benign purpose for these operations",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated class with a non-descriptive name, which overrides the 'run' method of the install command. During installation on Windows systems, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string with a static Fernet key, and executes the resulting code via exec(). The presence of obfuscation, encrypted remote payload execution, and the use of 'exec()' strongly suggest malicious intent, such as code injection or remote control. The package setup metadata appears legitimate but is likely a cover. The code’s structure and hidden code execution flow raise significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated, malicious behavior by executing remote-decrypted code during installation on Windows, which could lead to system compromise or data theft. The use of encrypted payloads, 'exec()', and obfuscated code classifies it as likely malicious.",
