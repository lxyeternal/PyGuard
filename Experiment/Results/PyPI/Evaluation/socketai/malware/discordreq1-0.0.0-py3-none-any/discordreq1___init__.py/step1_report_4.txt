  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'discord' from the 'discordreq1' package. Without additional code, it is impossible to determine if this is malicious. The import itself is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. There are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze, nor any anomalies present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior detected. Insufficient context to identify any malicious activity or security risks.",
