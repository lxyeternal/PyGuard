{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to steal sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers, Discord, Steam, and other applications, then upload the data to external servers, primarily Discord webhooks and anonfiles.",
  "sources": "Input sources include local files (browser databases, logs, cookies), environment variables (e.g., LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA), network requests (IP geolocation, Discord API), and user data files in specific directories.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data is sent via HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks and anonfiles upload endpoints. Data flows from local system files and memory to remote servers without validation or user consent.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data such as tokens, cookies, passwords, and files are extracted from local storage and databases, decrypted if necessary, then transmitted to remote endpoints. Functions like 'upl05dT4k31' and 'uploadToAnonfiles' facilitate data exfiltration, often triggered after collection from various sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated, unnecessary imports, redundant functions, and functions that use threading without synchronization. It hardcodes webhook URLs, uses deprecated or risky techniques for decrypting stored credentials, and kills processes like browsers or wallets before zipping files, indicating malicious intent. The code also extracts tokens and sensitive data from browser logs and Discord API responses without any user prompt.",
  "analysis": "The script performs multiple malicious activities: extracting tokens from log files, decrypting stored passwords and cookies from browsers, gathering Discord user info, stealing wallet files, and other sensitive files, then uploading these data to external servers. It uses functions like 'CryptUnprotectData' for decrypting Windows DPAPI-encrypted data, indicating knowledge of Windows internals. The code employs threading for concurrent execution, likely to evade detection or speed up exfiltration. The hardcoded webhook URL suggests its use in a malicious or hijacking context. It also terminates processes related to wallets and browsers, then zips and uploads associated files, which is typical of info-stealing malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a highly malicious information stealer designed to harvest tokens, passwords, cookies, files, and other sensitive data from a compromised system. It exfiltrates data via Discord webhooks and anonfiles, actively terminates security-related processes to facilitate data collection, and employs obfuscation techniques. Its activities violate privacy, security, and user trust, making it extremely dangerous.",
