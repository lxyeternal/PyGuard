{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to steal various sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from the user's system and send the data to a remote Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from local browser storage files, SQLite databases, and log/ldb files in user directories. It also reads environment variables, local state files, and searches specific directories for targeted files.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to a remote Discord webhook URL via HTTP POST requests. Sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files are uploaded or embedded in messages sent to this webhook.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data collected from browser storage, log files, and directories flow into processing functions that decrypt or parse the data, then are sent directly to the webhook in structured messages. File data is zipped and uploaded to anonymous file hosting services before links are sent.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URL, extensive use of environment variables, copying and decrypting sensitive browser data, attempting to kill processes, and collecting tokens and cookies without user consent. It also implements multiple functions for data exfiltration, file zipping, and uploading to external servers. Unnecessary imports and obfuscated or confusing function naming suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script extensively targets user data such as browser cookies, passwords, tokens, and files from common directories related to browsers, Discord, Steam, and other applications. It decrypts encrypted credentials using Windows APIs, extracts tokens from log files, and uploads the collected data to external services. The functions 'GatherAll', 'Kiwi', and related routines coordinate multi-threaded collection and exfiltration. The code also contains mechanisms to detect certain flags ('TR6st') and can kill processes associated with certain applications before archiving data. All data is systematically sent to a Discord webhook, indicating clear intent to exfiltrate user information surreptitiously.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, performing unauthorized access to browser and application data, decrypting and extracting sensitive information, and exfiltrating it to a remote server. It employs obfuscation and process termination techniques to hide its activities and maximize data theft. Its purpose is to compromise user accounts, passwords, cookies, and files without user consent.",
