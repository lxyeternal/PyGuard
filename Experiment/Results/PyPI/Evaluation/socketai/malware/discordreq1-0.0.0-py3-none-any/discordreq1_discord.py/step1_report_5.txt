{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to steal user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, browser data, and files from various applications and browsers, then exfiltrate the information via webhooks or file uploads.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, local files (browser data, cookies, passwords), open network connections (IP address, geolocation), and user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents).",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration occurs through HTTP POST requests to Discord webhook URLs, requests to file hosting services (gofile.io, transfer.sh, anonfiles), and local file writing (stealer logs).",
  "flows": "The code reads user data from local files and browser storage (sources), processes/decrypts sensitive data (e.g., passwords, cookies), and then transmits this data via web requests or saves it locally before uploading (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URL, extensive use of environment variables, broad file system access, thread-based concurrent data collection, and functions that handle sensitive data collection in an automated manner. It also kills processes related to known browsers or wallets, indicating malicious intent. The use of regex to extract tokens and the function names (e.g., 'albaner Stealer') further suggest malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script performs extensive data harvesting from browsers, Discord, and other applications. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies, extracts tokens from logs, and uploads collected data to external servers. The functions such as 'GatherZips', 'Z1pTh1ngs', and 'uploadToAnonfiles' are used for file collection, zipping, and uploading data. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and process-killing commands demonstrates malicious intent to silently steal and exfiltrate user credentials and personal data without user consent. The code's structure, including multi-threading and dynamic file processing, suggests sophisticated data extraction, typical of malware or info-stealer tools.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a malicious information stealer designed to harvest sensitive user data from browsers, applications, and files, then send or upload the data to external servers via webhooks or file hosting services. It includes process termination to hide activity and handles various data types stealthily. The high likelihood of malicious intent and extensive data exfiltration mechanisms classify this as malware with significant security risk.",
