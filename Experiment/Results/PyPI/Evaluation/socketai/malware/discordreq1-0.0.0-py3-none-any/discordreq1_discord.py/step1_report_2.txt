{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for extracting sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from a user's system, and then exfiltrating this data to a remote server, specifically via Discord webhooks and file uploads.",
  "sources": "User input from log files, environment variables, local files (e.g., 'Login Data', 'Cookies', 'Local State'), and network requests to external APIs (e.g., IP geolocation, Discord API).",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Discord webhook URLs, file uploads to external servers, subprocess commands that terminate processes, and file system operations for reading/writing sensitive data and creating ZIP archives.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and system info are collected from local files and environment variables (sources). These data are processed, decrypted, and formatted (flows) before being exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks or file upload URLs (sinks). Multiple threads handle data collection and uploading concurrently, facilitating rapid exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious intent: collection of tokens and passwords from browser storage, system info, IP geolocation, and the exfiltration of this data to a Discord webhook. It terminates processes associated with popular cryptocurrency wallets and browsers to potentially disable security measures or interfere with analysis. Hardcoded webhook URL, obfuscated data handling, and extensive use of threading for data exfiltration further suggest malicious activity. The code also automatically collects cookies, passwords, and files matching certain keywords across user directories, which is typical for stealer malware.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive credential stealer targeting browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, and messaging apps. It extracts tokens, passwords, cookies, and files by navigating user directories and local storage. It decrypts encrypted data using Windows API calls and AES decryption. The collected data is formatted into messages and uploaded to a Discord webhook, facilitating real-time exfiltration. The code also terminates processes related to cryptocurrency wallets and browsers to hinder user activity or analysis. Multi-threading is used to speed up data collection and upload processes. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL, targeted file searches, and process termination indicates malicious intent. The code does not exhibit obfuscation or complex anti-analysis techniques, but the functionality aligns with typical stealer malware activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a credential and file stealer targeting various user applications, with capabilities to exfiltrate sensitive data to a remote Discord server and upload files to external servers. Its behaviors, including data harvesting, process termination, and network communication to a hardcoded webhook, classify it as malicious malware designed for unauthorized data collection and exfiltration.",
