{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'custpmtkinter' with specific metadata and a custom installation class that executes encrypted code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The encrypted data within Fernet decrypt() call, the os.name check, and the exec() function.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executing decrypted code, which can run arbitrary code on the system.",
  "flows": "The code checks if OS is Windows, then decrypts and executes encrypted code via exec(), which is a potential source of malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload with Fernet and execution via exec() during installation only on Windows. The payload is encrypted, making it difficult to determine its purpose without decryption, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines package metadata. It customizes the install command to run code that decrypts and executes a payload if on Windows OS. The use of encrypted code and dynamic execution during setup is unusual and potentially malicious. The Fernet key and encrypted payload are hardcoded, which suggests obfuscation or malicious intent. There are no other suspicious or malicious activities outside this encrypted payload execution. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', but 'fernet' is only used internally for decryption, and 'requests' is imported but not used elsewhere, possibly as a distraction or for future malicious extension.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a potentially malicious behavior: decrypting and executing code during installation on Windows, which could be malicious payload. The encryption and runtime execution raise significant security concerns, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
