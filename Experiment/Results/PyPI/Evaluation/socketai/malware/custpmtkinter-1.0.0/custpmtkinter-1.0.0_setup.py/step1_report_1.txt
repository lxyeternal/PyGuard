{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'custpmtkinter' with metadata and a custom installation command that potentially executes code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment info (os.name), imports modules ('os', 'requests', 'fernet'), and decrypts and executes a hidden payload via Fernet.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code which is dynamically fetched and decrypted at install time, potentially leading to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows (nt), the code imports 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypts a payload with a symmetric key, and executes it with exec().",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed at install time is highly suspicious. The code uses a base64-encoded key and encrypted data, indicating obfuscation and potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata and a custom install command that, on Windows systems, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypts an embedded encrypted payload using a hardcoded key, and executes it dynamically via exec(). The use of encryption and dynamic execution suggests an attempt to conceal malicious payloads. Since the payload is decrypted at install time and executed without any verification, it could be used to run malicious code or establish backdoors. The environment check for Windows OS and dynamic code execution are suspicious behaviors typically associated with malware delivery. The code's structure, including obfuscated encryption and runtime execution, strongly indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script includes a concealed payload that executes during installation on Windows systems, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior. The use of encrypted payloads, dynamic execution, and hardcoded cryptographic keys points to intent to hide malicious actions. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious and dangerous for inclusion in any package.",
