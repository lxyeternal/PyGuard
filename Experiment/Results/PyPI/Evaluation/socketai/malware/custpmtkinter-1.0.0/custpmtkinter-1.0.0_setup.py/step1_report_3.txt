{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'custpmtkinter' that customizes installation behavior with potential encrypted code execution.",
  "sources": "os.name check, import statements for requests and fernet, execution of decrypted code via exec().",
  "sinks": "exec() call with decrypted code; potentially executes malicious code embedded in encrypted payload.",
  "flows": "Detection of os.name check → conditional import of requests and fernet → decryption of payload → execution via exec() (source to sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with decrypted payload; presence of hardcoded encryption key; encrypted code payload embedded within the script; suspiciously obfuscated setup description and long description; unusual class name and variable names; minimal documentation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, upon installation on Windows ('nt'), imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes a payload from a hardcoded key. The payload is encrypted, which could hide malicious code. The code does not perform any visible safe operations and the encrypted payload is a significant concern as it may execute malicious actions when decrypted and run. The presence of encrypted code and use of exec() suggest attempts to conceal malicious activities, possibly to evade detection. Overall, the script’s behavior indicates potential malicious intent related to executing hidden code during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains encrypted payload execution via exec(), hardcoded cryptographic keys, and obfuscated setup descriptions, indicating high suspicion of malicious behavior. It appears designed to run concealed code during installation, especially on Windows systems, which poses significant security risks.",
