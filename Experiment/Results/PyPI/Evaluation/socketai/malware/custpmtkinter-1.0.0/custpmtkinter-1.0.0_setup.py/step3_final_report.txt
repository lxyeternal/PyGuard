{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup installation class that, on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a payload at install time, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), imports 'requests' and 'fernet', and decrypts data using a hardcoded Fernet key.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or backdoor installation.",
  "flows": "Environment check (os.name) → import requests and fernet → decrypt payload with hardcoded key → execute payload with exec() during install on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payloads with hardcoded cryptographic keys, dynamic execution of decrypted code during setup, obfuscated variable and class names, and conditional execution limited to Windows.",
  "analysis": "The script employs obfuscation techniques: encrypted payload, hardcoded cryptographic key, and runtime execution via exec(). It performs environment-specific behavior, executing potentially malicious code during installation on Windows. The pattern aligns with known malware tactics such as concealed payload delivery and backdoor setup. The high suspicion is justified by the use of dynamic code execution, encrypted payloads, and obfuscation, all of which are common in malicious packages. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, obfuscated ~0.8, risk ~0.9) are consistent with these indicators. Without analyzing the decrypted payload, certainty cannot be absolute, but the evidence strongly suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior, primarily due to encrypted payload decryption and execution during setup, which could facilitate malware, backdoors, or other malicious activities. The high scores in the reports are justified, and the package should be flagged for further review and caution in use.",
