  "conclusion": "The code contains highly suspicious, likely malicious behavior through obfuscated PowerShell execution during package installation. The high obfuscation, hidden execution, and suspicious URL indicate malicious intent, warranting classification as malicious. The package should be flagged, and further payload decoding is recommended for confirmation."
