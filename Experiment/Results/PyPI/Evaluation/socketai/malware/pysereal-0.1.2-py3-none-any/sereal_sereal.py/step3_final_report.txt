{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a credential and data stealer, collecting system info, browser passwords, cookies, history, credit cards, Discord tokens, and screenshots, then exfiltrating this data via a Discord webhook. It also establishes persistence by copying itself to APPDATA and modifying registry run keys.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, local browser storage files (leveldb logs, SQLite databases), subprocess outputs (system info), network requests (IP, geolocation), and local files (history, cookies, credit cards).",
  "sinks": "Discord webhook (sending embedded messages, files, screenshots), ZIP archive of collected data, self-copying for persistence, registry modifications.",
  "flows": "Data is read from local files and environment variables, decrypted using Windows DPAPI and browser-specific keys, validated via network requests, then formatted and sent through the webhook. The code also copies itself and modifies registry for persistence.",
  "anomalies": "Commented anti-debug routines, broad data collection routines, decryption of stored credentials, self-copying into startup directory, registry modifications, extensive use of decryption routines for tokens and passwords.",
  "analysis": "The code performs comprehensive data harvesting including Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, history, credit cards, and system info. It decrypts stored credentials with Windows DPAPI, validates tokens via API requests, and exfiltrates all data through a Discord webhook. It also copies itself into the APPDATA directory and modifies registry entries to ensure persistence. The code contains commented anti-debug routines and uses straightforward Python code without obfuscation. These behaviors are characteristic of malware designed for credential theft, surveillance, and persistence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a credential and system info stealer with persistence mechanisms. It exfiltrates sensitive data via a Discord webhook, performs system reconnaissance, and maintains persistence. All behaviors align with malware activity, and the code poses a high security threat.",
