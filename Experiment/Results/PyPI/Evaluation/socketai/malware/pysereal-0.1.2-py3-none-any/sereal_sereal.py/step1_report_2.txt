{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect and exfiltrate sensitive system information, browser data including cookies, login credentials, web history, saved cards, and Discord tokens, then send this data to a specified webhook. It also attempts to maintain persistence via registry modifications.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, local files (browser storage, SQLite databases, leveldb logs), system commands (WMIC), and network requests for IP and geolocation data.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to an external Discord webhook. Sensitive data such as Discord tokens, login credentials, cookies, credit card info, and system info are exfiltrated via webhook POST requests. Files like ZIP archives of extracted data are also uploaded.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (browser databases, local files, system commands, environment variables, network requests) through parsing, decryption, and formatting steps, then is sent via requests to the webhook, or written to files and subsequently uploaded as ZIP archives.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains multiple signs of malicious intent: collecting Discord tokens by decrypting local storage, extracting browser data including cookies, passwords, and history, exfiltrating system identifiers and user info, and maintaining persistence via registry modifications. The inclusion of obfuscated, unused, or commented-out anti-debugging code, and extensive data collection routines suggest malicious activity. The script also writes a stub executable and modifies registry run keys, indicating persistence efforts.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed as a comprehensive info stealer targeting Windows systems. It collects user information, browser data, and Discord tokens by decrypting local storage and SQLite databases. It then formats and sends this information to a Discord webhook, potentially for malicious monitoring or credential theft. The code also attempts persistence by copying itself and modifying registry keys. Many functions perform standard data extraction but combined, they form a malicious credential and data harvesting tool. The anti-debugging code is commented out, but present, indicating possible evasion or obfuscation tactics. The overall structure, data collection methods, and exfiltration points strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, functioning as a credential stealer and system info exfiltration tool. It targets Windows environments, harvests Discord tokens, browser data, system identifiers, and user info, and uploads them to a remote server via webhook. The code demonstrates clear malicious behavior with multiple data collection vectors, persistence mechanisms, and exfiltration methods.",
