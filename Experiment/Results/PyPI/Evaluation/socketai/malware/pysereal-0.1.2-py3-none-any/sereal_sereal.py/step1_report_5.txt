{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data collection and exfiltration, including system information, user credentials, cookies, browsing history, saved passwords, and Discord tokens. It is likely intended for malicious surveillance, credential theft, and privacy invasion.",
  "sources": "Reads input/data from various sources including browser profile directories, local State files, SQLite databases, environment variables, system commands, and network requests to external geolocation APIs and Discord API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via Discord webhooks. Also writes files to disk (e.g., logs, credentials, cookies, browser history), zips them, and uploads the archive. Executes system commands and interacts with system registry for persistence.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as browser files, system commands, environment variables, and network responses to sinks including webhook uploads, file storage, and command execution. Extracted tokens and credentials are exfiltrated through Discord webhook messages. System info and user data are collected and sent without user consent.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains commented-out anti-debugging routines, extensive data harvesting from multiple browsers and Discord, and hardcoded webhook URL. It performs stealthy copying and decryption of sensitive data (passwords, cookies, tokens) and compresses all collected data into a zip file for exfiltration. It also bypasses user prompts and logs critical information silently. The presence of large, complex data collection and exfiltration routines is suspicious in a non-utility context.",
  "analysis": "The script is a multifaceted malware-like program that harvests system info, Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, browsing history, downloads, and credit card data from various browsers and Firefox profiles. It decrypts stored passwords using Windows Data Protection API and Chromium's local state. It also collects system identifiers, network info, and geolocation data. The data is compiled into structured Discord embeds and sent via webhooks. It employs stealthy file copying, registry modifications for persistence, and archive creation. The code is designed to run without user interaction, with multiple points of data exfiltration, indicating malicious intent. Commented-out anti-debug checks suggest an attempt to evade analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior indicative of malicious software. It exfiltrates sensitive user data, system information, and Discord tokens without consent, potentially enabling identity theft, credential theft, and privacy invasion. Its sophisticated data collection methods, encryption/decryption routines, and covert file handling confirm its malicious intent. Therefore, this package should be considered malware with a very high security risk.",
