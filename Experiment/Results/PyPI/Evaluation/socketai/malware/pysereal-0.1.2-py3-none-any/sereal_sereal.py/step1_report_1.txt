{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect sensitive system information, browser data, Discord tokens, and other user data, then send it to a specified webhook. It also includes persistence mechanisms and potential credential theft functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input data is gathered from system environment variables, local files (browser storage, history, cookies, credit cards, saved logins), subprocess outputs (HWID, processes), and network requests (geolocation, token validation).",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via Discord webhook, including system info, screenshots, Discord tokens, cookies, login data, history, credit card info, and browser credentials. Files are created and zipped for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (local files, environment variables, system commands, network responses) to sinks (webhook, files, compressed archives). For example, browser data is decrypted and appended to data structures, then sent through webhooks; tokens are extracted, validated, and exfiltrated; system info is gathered and sent as embeds.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains commented-out anti-debugging checks, which suggest an intent to evade detection. It copies itself into startup locations, modifies registry for persistence, and harvests a broad range of sensitive data including Discord tokens, system identifiers, browser passwords, cookies, history, credit card info, and screenshots. Use of hardcoded webhook URL indicates targeted exfiltration. It leverages cryptography to decrypt stored tokens, indicating intent to access protected data. No obfuscation is present; code structure is straightforward but broad data collection is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with extensive imports, indicating broad system access and data handling capabilities. It includes functions for persistence (adding registry entries, copying executable), system info collection (HWID, CPU, GPU, RAM, IP, MAC, Wi-Fi passwords), and data extraction from various browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.), including saved passwords, cookies, history, credit cards, and login data, often decrypted via Windows DPAPI and browser-specific keys. The code also extracts Discord tokens from multiple locations, decrypts them, and validates their authenticity through API calls. It prepares detailed Discord embed messages containing tokens, user info, guilds, friends, billing info, and other sensitive data, then exfiltrates via a Discord webhook. There are mechanisms for collecting system info, screenshots, and browser data, indicating comprehensive credential theft, surveillance, and exfiltration capabilities. The code does not obfuscate or encrypt its logic; its purpose and behaviors are transparent. It employs standard techniques used in malware for credential harvesting, system reconnaissance, and persistence, with no benign functionality evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors including credential theft (Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, credit cards), system reconnaissance, and data exfiltration via webhooks. It employs persistence methods (registry, copying itself), decrypts protected browser data, and captures screenshots. The presence of broad data collection, decryption routines, and exfiltration mechanisms strongly suggests malicious intent. Overall, the script qualifies as malware with high security risk. It is highly likely to cause harm if executed.",
