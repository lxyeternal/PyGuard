{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for malicious purposes, primarily to extract sensitive user data from browsers and Discord tokens, and to send this information to a remote webhook.",
  "sources": "Input sources include system and environment variables, files in browser profile directories, SQLite databases for saved passwords, cookies, browsing history, download history, credit card data, and Discord-related files. Network requests to external services for IP geolocation and token validation are also sources.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via Discord webhooks. Sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, history, credit card data, and system info is collected and transmitted externally. The code also copies and zips user data files, then uploads them to a remote server.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local system files (browser profiles, SQLite databases, environment variables, process info, network info) to internal functions that decrypt, parse, and format this data, then ultimately send it to a remote webhook. Discord tokens are validated and collected, then detailed user info is gathered and uploaded.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains numerous signs of malicious intent, such as: a large number of hardcoded directories targeting user data, code to extract and decrypt Discord tokens and save them, code to extract passwords, cookies, browsing history, credit cards, and other private info. The commented-out anti-debug checks and process-killing routines suggest an attempt to evade detection. It creates persistence by copying itself to a directory and setting registry keys. The inclusion of functions to gather system info and take screenshots also points to surveillance activity. The code is obfuscated through extensive string manipulation and dynamic function calling, but uses common techniques rather than advanced obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive info-stealer targeting Windows systems. It gathers browser data from multiple Chromium-based browsers and Firefox, extracts Discord tokens from various local storage files and memory, decrypts sensitive info such as passwords and credit card data, and collects system info like HWID, CPU, GPU, RAM, IP, and location. It also captures a screenshot and uploads all collected data to a Discord webhook. It employs standard techniques for data extraction, decryption, and obfuscation, with functions designed to evade debugging and process detection. The code's intent is clearly malicious, aiming to exfiltrate personal and system data without user consent. The presence of commented anti-debug routines and persistence mechanisms further indicate malicious sabotage. Overall, this is a well-structured malware designed for data theft and espionage.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious behavior as a comprehensive info-stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser credentials, personal data, and system info. It exfiltrates this data via Discord webhooks, indicating an intent to hijack user accounts and invade privacy. Its structure and functions are consistent with malware rather than benign open-source code. The overall security risk is high, and it should be considered dangerous for use in any environment.",
