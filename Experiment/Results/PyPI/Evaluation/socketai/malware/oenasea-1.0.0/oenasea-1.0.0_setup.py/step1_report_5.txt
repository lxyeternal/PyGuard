  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation step which decrypts and executes embedded code if on Windows.",
  "sources": "Import statements, environment checks, encrypted data, and execution of decrypted code during install.",
  "sinks": "exec() call executing decrypted code, potentially executing malicious payload on Windows during installation.",
  "flows": "Environment check (os.name) -> import of requests and Fernet -> decryption of embedded payload -> execution of payload via exec() during install.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution with exec() during installation, no visible benign purpose. The code decrypts and executes code at install time which can be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration that, when run on Windows, imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes code stored in an encrypted string. The use of exec() on decrypted code is suspicious, as it could run arbitrary malicious code. The presence of encrypted data and runtime decryption suggests obfuscation aimed at hiding malicious intent. The rest of the setup uses standard packaging practices. The encrypted payload's purpose is unclear but executing it during installation is a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by decrypting and executing code during installation on Windows systems, which could be a backdoor or malicious payload. The use of encrypted data and runtime execution strongly suggests intent to obfuscate malicious activity. Overall, the package should be considered unsafe for use.",
