{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'oenasea' and includes a custom install command that executes potentially malicious code on Windows systems during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the environment (os.name) and imports modules (requests, fernet). It also contains hardcoded encrypted data within the Fernet decryption call.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec() when on Windows, which could execute arbitrary and malicious code supplied by the encrypted payload.",
  "flows": "The script checks the OS, then conditionally imports modules and decrypts code using Fernet, finally executing this code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payloads and execution of decrypted code at install time. The code does not reveal its true intent until runtime, and the payload appears obfuscated. Use of exec() with decrypted code is highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and a custom installation class. Within the run() method, it performs an OS check for Windows. If true, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from 'cryptography'. It then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string and executes the resulting code via exec(), which could be malicious. The use of encrypted payloads and runtime execution of code suggests malicious intent. The overall code structure and obfuscation indicate an attempt to hide malicious behavior, such as executing arbitrary code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, executing encrypted payloads during installation on Windows systems. The use of encrypted code, runtime exec(), and OS-specific execution strongly suggests an attempt to introduce malicious activity during package setup. This package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
