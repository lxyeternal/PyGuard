{
  "purpose": "Detect malicious behavior involving runtime decryption and execution of code during package installation on Windows.",
  "sources": "Encrypted payload string decrypted with Fernet during install; the code reads no external input but performs internal decryption.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executes decrypted code, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "During install, if os.name == 'nt', decrypt payload with Fernet, then execute with exec().",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload hardcoded; code decrypts and executes at install time only on Windows; obfuscated variable names and strings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup package with a custom install class that, on Windows, imports requests and Fernet, decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string, and executes it via exec(). The encrypted payload and use of exec() strongly suggest malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during setup. The obfuscation and conditional OS check are typical of malicious backdoors. The high scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.9, risk ~0.85) are justified given the behavior. The code's pattern is a classic malicious technique to hide payloads and execute arbitrary code at install time, posing a serious security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential through encrypted payload decryption and runtime execution, confirming malicious intent. The high scores across reports are justified. The package should be considered malicious and avoided.",
