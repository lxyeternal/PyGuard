      "conclusion": "This code is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a credential and data stealer targeting multiple applications and browsers. It employs obfuscation, system API calls, and exfiltration techniques to harvest and transmit sensitive user data. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the code should be flagged and removed from repositories or systems."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits varying degrees of obfuscation and suspicious activity, with Reports 1-3 indicating moderate to high malicious potential justified by their scores. Reports 4 and 5 are benign. The scoring aligns well with the evidence, with minor adjustments recommended for Report 2's malware score."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits patterns that could be exploited maliciously, especially dynamic execution and environment variable reliance. While no confirmed malicious payloads are present, the risk is moderate. Scores are generally appropriate; a slight increase in Report 1's malware score is recommended for caution."
