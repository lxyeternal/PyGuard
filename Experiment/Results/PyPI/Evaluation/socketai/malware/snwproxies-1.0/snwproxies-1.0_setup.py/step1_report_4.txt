{
  "purpose": "The code is designed as a stealer targeting Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and other sensitive data from various browsers and applications, then exfiltrates this data via a Discord webhook. It also includes functionality to gather information from other platforms, possibly for malicious monitoring or theft.",
  "sources": "Reads input/data from browser profile directories, local storage databases, log files, and environment variables. Specifically, it extracts tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive files from specified paths.",
  "sinks": "Uploads stolen data to a remote Discord webhook URL and transfer.sh. Uses network requests to exfiltrate tokens, passwords, cookies, and files. Also executes system commands to terminate processes and manipulate files.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data (tokens, passwords, cookies) are collected from local files and databases, then processed and decrypted. Data is stored temporarily in variables and files, then sent to a remote webhook or upload service via HTTP POST requests. The code terminates browser processes before zipping and uploading files.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obfuscated and dynamic code techniques such as exec('') with no code, extensive use of threading, and dynamic process termination. Hardcoded Discord webhook URL suggests malicious intent. The code performs environment variable reads, process kills, and manipulates browser/user data in ways consistent with malware. The presence of functions like 'GatherAll' that collect wide-ranging sensitive data without user consent is suspicious. Some functions (e.g., getToken, getPassw, getCookie) are tailored to extract data stealthily. Overall, the code employs suspicious practices typical of malware.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing numerous modules, some dynamically installed, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. It contains functions to decrypt Windows data, extract Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and user info from local storage and browser databases. It also searches common directories for sensitive files, zips them, and uploads them to external URLs. Hardcoded webhook URL confirms data exfiltration intent. The code terminates certain browser processes before zipping and uploading data, likely to prevent data loss or ensure access. It employs multithreading for data collection, making detection and analysis more difficult. The overall structure aligns with typical credential-stealing malware designed for data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a malicious stealer targeting Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive user data. It employs techniques to avoid detection, exfiltrates data via webhooks, and manipulates system processes and files stealthily. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, environment variable manipulations, and extensive data harvesting indicates malicious intent and high security risk.",
