{
  "purpose": "The source code functions as a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, browser data, and system information. It exfiltrates this data via a hardcoded Discord webhook and uploads files to external hosting services, employing decryption routines, process termination, threading, and obfuscation to maximize stealth and effectiveness.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from browser storage directories (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge), Discord local storage, log files (.log, .ldb), local databases (Login Data), environment variables, and in-memory variables such as tokens and cookies extracted from logs and databases.",
  "sinks": "Exfiltration occurs through a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, uploads to transfer.sh and anonfiles, and via HTTP requests using requests and urlopen. Data includes tokens, passwords, cookies, user info, and system IP addresses.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local browser and application files, decrypted using Windows APIs and cryptographic routines, then transmitted via webhook messages and uploaded files. The code employs threading for parallel collection, process termination to disable browsers, and zipping of data before exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable names, unnecessary imports (e.g., builtins, exec('')), silent dependency installation, dynamic module imports, and functions with misleading or malicious names ('Stealer', 'Kiwi', 'GatherAll'). It also kills processes (browsers, wallets) before zipping data, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed for malicious data theft, including extracting Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and browser data. It decrypts stored credentials, collects user info, and exfiltrates via webhooks and file uploads. The code employs obfuscation, silent dependency installation, threading, and process termination to evade detection and ensure data collection. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and functions named 'Stealer' and 'Kiwi' strongly suggest malicious intent. The code's structure and actions align with typical credential-stealing malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a credential and data stealer targeting multiple applications and browsers. It employs obfuscation, system API calls, and exfiltration techniques to harvest and transmit sensitive user data. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the code should be flagged and removed from repositories or systems.",
