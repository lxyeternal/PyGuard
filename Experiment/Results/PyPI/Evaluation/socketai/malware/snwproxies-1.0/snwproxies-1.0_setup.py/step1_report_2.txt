{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed for stealing sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and other personal information from various browsers and applications, then exfiltrating this data via webhooks or file uploads.",
  "sources": "Input data is collected from browser storage files (Login Data, Cookies, Local State), log files, and in-memory variables. It reads local files related to browsers and applications, and decodes/encrypts stored credentials and tokens.",
  "sinks": "Exfiltration occurs via HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks, transfer.sh links, and other network requests. Data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and personal details are sent to remote servers. Files are uploaded to external services like transfer.sh and anonfiles.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data is extracted from local storage files, decrypted, then assembled into messages or files, and transmitted over the network to remote servers/webhooks. The code searches for specific patterns (e.g., tokens, passwords), decrypts data, then sends it asynchronously.",
  "anomalies": "The code has hardcoded webhook URL, uses dynamic package installation, and performs multiple network requests with minimal validation. It collects passwords, cookies, tokens, and browser data under the guise of 'collecting user info'. The code also contains obfuscated or misleading variable names, and extensive use of threading for data collection. It attempts to kill processes and zip sensitive files for upload. There are indications of malicious intent, such as collecting browser and application data, decrypting stored credentials, and exfiltrating this data.",
  "analysis": "The script is structured to harvest sensitive user data from various sources on the host machine. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies, extracts Discord tokens, and gathers browser and application data. It then uploads this data or sends it to predefined webhooks. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, data exfiltration functions, and collection of sensitive credentials strongly suggest malicious behavior. The code uses threading to speed up data collection, handles multiple data sources, and manages network communication covertly. The logic is consistent with typical information-stealing malware, designed to operate stealthily and exfiltrate user data without consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious intent, acting as a stealer for passwords, tokens, cookies, and personal data, then exfiltrating this data via network requests. It contains no legitimate functionality aligned with the package's initial description ('Proxies') and instead performs extensive unauthorized data collection. Overall, the script is malicious with high security risk, and should be considered dangerous.",
