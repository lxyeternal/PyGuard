  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions, environment variables, configuration files, or external data fetches (e.g., network requests).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, system commands, or data leaks through logging or printing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through variables, function calls, or data structures, but specific paths cannot be identified without the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are detectable without the code snippet.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of actual code, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Typically, this involves identifying source functions, sink functions, and data flow patterns to detect malicious intent or security issues. In this case, no such details are available.",
  "conclusion": "No specific malicious behavior or security risks can be determined based on the provided empty code snippet. The code review cannot proceed without actual code content.",
