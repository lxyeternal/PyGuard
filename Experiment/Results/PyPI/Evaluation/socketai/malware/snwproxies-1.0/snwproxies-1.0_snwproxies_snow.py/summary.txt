  "conclusion": "The code exhibits patterns that could be exploited maliciously, especially dynamic execution and environment variable reliance. While no confirmed malicious payloads are present, the risk is moderate. Scores are generally appropriate; a slight increase in Report 1's malware score is recommended for caution."
