  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, system/network operations, dynamic execution points, data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network requests, data exfiltration points, environment variable access, dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input sources (env vars, user input) to system/network operations and dynamic execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic execution, lack of code transparency, use of untrusted inputs without sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic constructs in some reports, with no direct malicious activity observed. Untrusted inputs are used in some cases, raising moderate security concerns. No evidence of malware such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads is present. The scores assigned reflect suspicion levels appropriately, with low malware likelihood and moderate risk in cases involving untrusted inputs. The overall code appears benign, with no significant vulnerabilities or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code generally shows no active malicious behavior. Obfuscation and untrusted input handling warrant cautious scoring but do not confirm malicious intent. The scores across reports are consistent with the analysis, with minor adjustments suggested for risk levels where appropriate.",
