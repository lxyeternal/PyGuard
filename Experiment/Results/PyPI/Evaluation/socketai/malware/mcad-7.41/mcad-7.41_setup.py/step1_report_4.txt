{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'mcad' package, with an embedded obfuscated PowerShell command likely intended for malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen, which is encoded and obfuscated; reading package metadata from the setup function.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call that executes an encoded PowerShell command with hidden window, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "The script checks for the existence of a directory 'tahg'; if not found, executes the obfuscated PowerShell command. The setup function registers package metadata but is unlikely to be malicious itself.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated PowerShell command encoded in base64, executed via subprocess without sanitization; use of try-except blocks suppressing errors; no apparent legitimate reason for such execution in a package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'distutils.core.setup' for package setup. It attempts to import 'subprocess' and 'os'. If the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it executes an obfuscated PowerShell command with hidden window, which is likely malicious given its encoding and context. The setup function defines package metadata without any suspicious code. The obfuscated PowerShell command appears designed to run silently, which is typical of malicious payloads. The try-except blocks suppress errors, which may hide failures or suspicious activity. Overall, the key concern is the execution of an encoded PowerShell command based on a directory check, indicating possible malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, encoded PowerShell that executes silently when a specific directory is missing, which is indicative of malicious behavior. The setup process itself appears legitimate, but the embedded PowerShell command and its execution are suspicious and likely malicious.",
