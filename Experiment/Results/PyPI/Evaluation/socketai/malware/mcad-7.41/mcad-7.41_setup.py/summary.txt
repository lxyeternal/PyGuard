  "conclusion": "The script executes an obfuscated, potentially malicious PowerShell command silently, with error suppression, indicating high suspicion of malicious activity. The package setup appears legitimate but is overshadowed by embedded suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is high, warranting further analysis of the decoded command and cautious handling."
