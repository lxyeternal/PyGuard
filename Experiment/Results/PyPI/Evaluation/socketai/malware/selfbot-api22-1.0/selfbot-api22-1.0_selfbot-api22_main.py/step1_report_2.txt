{
  "purpose": "The code provides a collection of utilities for terminal manipulation, including color management, text formatting, animations, and UI elements, primarily for enhancing terminal interfaces and visual effects.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from user prompts, terminal size information, and system commands; no external untrusted sources are explicitly read or fetched beyond system commands.",
  "sinks": "System commands executed via _system(), terminal output through _stdout, and user input via input(). No direct data leaks or unsafe data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input reading (input()) flows into user prompts; system commands (System.Command) are executed; terminal output is written via _stdout, with no untrusted data manipulation or external data transmission observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. There is extensive terminal manipulation and color generation, but no evidence of malicious behavior. The code does contain functions that manipulate terminal cursor and colors but do not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive terminal UI utility library, offering functions for color management, text centering, animations, and system commands. It interacts with the operating system through system calls and terminal controls. No code segments perform network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications that would indicate malicious activity. The functions are designed for enhancing terminal aesthetics and user interaction. There are no obfuscated or hidden code segments; the code is structured and readable. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The only potential concern is the use of system calls which could be exploited if user inputs are directly used without sanitization, but in this code, inputs are handled locally, and system commands are preset (e.g., 'cls', 'clear', 'title', 'mode'), with no user input directly influencing commands.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a terminal UI utility library with functions for colors, text formatting, and animations. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. It primarily manipulates the terminal display and interacts with the system in a controlled manner. No evidence of malware or security risks was found.",
