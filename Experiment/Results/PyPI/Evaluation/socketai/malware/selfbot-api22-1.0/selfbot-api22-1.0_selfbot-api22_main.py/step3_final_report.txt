  "purpose": "A comprehensive terminal UI utility library providing functions for colors, cursor control, animations, banners, and system interactions, primarily for enhancing terminal applications.",
  "sources": "Reads system info (_name, _terminal_size), user input (input()), stdout (_stdout), and executes system commands (_system).",
  "sinks": "System commands (_system), stdout writes, user input via input().",
  "flows": "User inputs and predefined commands influence terminal state; no external data flows into system commands or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Placeholder '...' in some functions indicates incomplete features but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured terminal utility toolkit with functions for colors, cursor management, animations, banners, and system control. It interacts with the system via controlled commands and user prompts. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns are present. Threading is used for animations but appears intended and safe. The code is readable, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The only potential concern is the use of system commands and user input, which are standard for such utilities and are used in a controlled manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured terminal utility library with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The low security risk stems from system command usage and user input handling, which are controlled and typical for such applications.",
