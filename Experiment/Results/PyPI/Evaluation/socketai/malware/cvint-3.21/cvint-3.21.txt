      "conclusion": "The code exhibits a highly suspicious pattern: an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup based on a filesystem check. This pattern is characteristic of malicious activity, such as payload delivery or backdoor installation. The high scores assigned by reports are justified, and further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious behavior. Until then, it should be treated as potentially malicious."
