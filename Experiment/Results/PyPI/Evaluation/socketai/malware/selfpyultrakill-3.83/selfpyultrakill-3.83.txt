      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered conditionally, with characteristics typical of malware or backdoors. The suspicious URL, obfuscation, and silent error suppression support a high likelihood of malicious intent. The scores in the reports are justified; I recommend treating this package as malicious until further decoding and analysis of the payload confirm safety."
