      "conclusion": "The package contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior via execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command in the background, potentially downloading or executing malicious code. The setup appears legitimate but is compromised by this hidden activity. Scores should reflect high malware (~0.8), obfuscation (~0.9), and security risk (~0.85). Further analysis of the decoded PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
