      "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated, potentially malicious code that executes covertly, posing a high security risk. The setup script itself appears legitimate but is exploited as a vector for malicious activity via encoded PowerShell commands. The high obfuscation and conditional execution warrant treating this package as malicious or compromised."
