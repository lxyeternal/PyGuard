{
  "purpose": "Importing the reverse_shell function from the main module, likely to be used elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .main import reverse_shell",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing or output functions present",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow visible beyond the import statement",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not show any suspicious behavior; the presence of 'reverse_shell' suggests potential malicious intent if used improperly, but this alone is not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a function named 'reverse_shell' from a local module. The function name 'reverse_shell' indicates potential malicious activity if executed, but in this context, the code itself does not execute it or perform any malicious actions. The minimal structure provides no further behavior or data flow, making it difficult to assess intent beyond the naming. The overall risk depends on how 'reverse_shell' is used elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior visible. The use of a function named 'reverse_shell' can be suspicious if executed, but the code snippet alone does not perform any malicious actions. Additional context is needed to determine the actual risk, but based solely on this fragment, there is no evidence of malicious activity.",
