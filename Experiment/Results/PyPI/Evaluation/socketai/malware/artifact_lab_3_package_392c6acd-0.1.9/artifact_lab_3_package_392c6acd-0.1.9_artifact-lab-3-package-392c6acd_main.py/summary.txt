  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, establishing a reverse shell to an external server. It contains no benign functionality or obfuscation. The high severity of this activity warrants a malware score of 1.0 and a security risk score of 1.0. The code's straightforward nature and explicit malicious behavior justify these scores. No adjustments are necessary."
