  "purpose": "Establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server for remote command execution.",
  "sources": "Host and port variables, socket connection, subprocess call executing bash command",
  "sinks": "Socket connection, subprocess call (reverse shell execution)",
  "flows": "Host and port variables → socket.connect() → os.dup2() → subprocess.call()",
  "anomalies": "The code connects to a remote server and redirects I/O streams to create a reverse shell, which is suspicious behavior. Hardcoded server address and port suggest malicious intent. No input validation or user prompts; direct execution of reverse shell command.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a socket connection to a specified remote server, then redirects standard input, output, and error streams to this socket. It then executes a bash reverse shell command, effectively granting remote control over the system. The presence of hardcoded IP and port, combined with the reverse shell setup, indicates malicious intent. The code does not include any benign functionality or user interaction, confirming it is designed for remote code execution without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to establish a reverse shell to an external server, which allows remote control of the affected system. This behavior constitutes a high security risk and clearly indicates malicious intent.",
