  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward setup script, with no suspicious activity. The confidence is high, and all scores are appropriately low.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it notes the standard nature of the script, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is a typical setup script, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion, standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others; no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports agree the code is benign. No malicious behavior is present or implied.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward; no obfuscation techniques are used.\n- **Security Risk:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of dynamic or external inputs, the risk score should remain at 0.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious intent, code, or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk, no vulnerabilities, no suspicious activity.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign Python package setup script. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the actual code content.",
