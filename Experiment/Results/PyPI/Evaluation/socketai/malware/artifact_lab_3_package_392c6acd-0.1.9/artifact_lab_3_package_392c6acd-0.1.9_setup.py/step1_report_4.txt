  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools, including reading a README.md for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file to obtain long_description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to data leakage or malicious activity are present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from source to sink; reading file does not involve untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward setup configuration without obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions, reads a README.md file for package description, and calls setup() with package metadata. No external inputs, environment variables, or dynamic code execution are involved. The code appears to be a standard, benign package setup script. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
