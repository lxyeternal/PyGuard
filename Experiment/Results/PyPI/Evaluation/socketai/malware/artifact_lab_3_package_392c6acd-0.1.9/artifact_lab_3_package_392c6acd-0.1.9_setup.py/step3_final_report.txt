  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; static parameters in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration points",
  "flows": "Reading file -> setup() configuration; no dynamic or external data flow",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script that imports setuptools, reads a README file, and calls setup() with fixed parameters. It contains no user input, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior justify these scores. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code aligns with best practices for package configuration and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
