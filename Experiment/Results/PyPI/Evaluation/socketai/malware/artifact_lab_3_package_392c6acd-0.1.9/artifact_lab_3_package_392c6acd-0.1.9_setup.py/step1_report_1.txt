  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package setup using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, calling find_packages() to list packages, defining setup() parameters.",
  "targets": "No untrusted input or data sources; the code uses static values and file reading only.",
  "flows": "File reading of README.md (source) to long_description parameter (sink), static package configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution, straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, reads a README.md file for long description, and calls setup() with static parameters. There are no user inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
