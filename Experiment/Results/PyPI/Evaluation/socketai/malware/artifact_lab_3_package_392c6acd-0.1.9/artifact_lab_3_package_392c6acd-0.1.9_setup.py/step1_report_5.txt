{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package using setuptools, specifying package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; calling setup() with package info",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or code execution",
  "flows": "Reading file content to variable, then passing metadata to setup() function",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard package setup tasks with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package configuration, reads a README.md file for detailed description, and invokes setup() with basic metadata and package information. No external inputs are processed at runtime beyond reading a static file, and no data is sent externally or manipulated maliciously. The code is a typical setup script for Python packages, with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
