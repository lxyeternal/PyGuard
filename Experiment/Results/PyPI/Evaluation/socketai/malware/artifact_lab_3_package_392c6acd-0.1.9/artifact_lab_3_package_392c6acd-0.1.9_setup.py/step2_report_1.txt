  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n- The code is a standard Python setup script.\n- It reads a README.md file for the long description.\n- It uses static values and no user input.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.\n- No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or network activity.\n- The code appears benign and typical for package setup.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Evaluation of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard setup, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Summary:** Same as above, straightforward setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Summary:** Standard setup, no untrusted input or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Summary:** Same as above, typical setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking for Anomalies:\n- **Malware:** No malicious code, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscation:** Code is clear, straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** No vulnerabilities or risky behavior identified.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks detected)\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scoring and reasoning in all reports are appropriate and aligned with the code's characteristics.",
