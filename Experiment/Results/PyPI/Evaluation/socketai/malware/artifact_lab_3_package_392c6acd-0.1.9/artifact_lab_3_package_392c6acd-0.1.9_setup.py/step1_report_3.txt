  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package, including reading a README.md file for long description and specifying package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file to obtain long description content.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted input or perform any sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading 'README.md' into the 'long_description' variable, which is then used in setup metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behavior are present. The code performs standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads a README file, and calls setup() with package information. No user input, network operations, or sensitive data handling occurs. The code does not include any obfuscated or malicious code. It appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads a README file and configures package metadata.",
