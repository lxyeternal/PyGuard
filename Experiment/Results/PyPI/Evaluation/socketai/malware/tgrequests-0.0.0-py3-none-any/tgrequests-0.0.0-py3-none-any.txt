      "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a credential, token, and data stealer with active exfiltration channels. It employs multiple techniques to evade detection, including process termination, silent dependency installation, and data encryption/decryption. The overall behavior confirms high malicious intent and high security risk."
