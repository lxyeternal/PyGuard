{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious information stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser data, credentials, cookies, files, and other sensitive information from the user's system. It collects, encrypts, and exfiltrates data via webhooks and file uploads.",
  "sources": "Input sources include browser storage files, logins database, Local State files, local environment variables, and user directories such as Desktop, Downloads, and Documents. It reads files like login data, cookies, Local State, and various user data files, as well as system environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve sending collected data to Discord webhooks and uploading files to external file hosting services (anonfiles, gofile.io). Data is transmitted via HTTP requests, and files are uploaded without encryption or user consent.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local system files (browser storage, login databases, cookies, directories), through decryption and parsing functions, to exfiltration points such as HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks and file hosting services. Data including tokens, credentials, cookies, and files are gathered and transmitted without user knowledge.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes hardcoded webhook URLs, automatic package installation commands, network requests for IP geolocation, self-starting threads for parallel data collection, obfuscation attempts with unorthodox code structure, and functions that terminate processes (taskkill) related to certain browsers or applications. It also performs file zipping and uploads to external servers. The presence of extensive credential harvesting, token validation, and system manipulation indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script initiates by importing numerous modules, including requests, cryptography, and system libraries. It defines functions for decryption of Windows data, retrieving IP and user info, and managing data exfiltration. It actively installs missing dependencies, indicating an intent to run reliably on target systems. The main functions gather tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data from browsers and installed applications, then upload or send this data via webhooks or file hosting services. Threaded functions enable parallel execution for comprehensive data collection. The code also searches for specific files and folders associated with sensitive accounts and cryptocurrencies, zips them, and uploads. It terminates browser processes to unlock data and ensures persistence. Hardcoded webhooks and URLs confirm data exfiltration. Overall, all actions align with typical malware and stealer behavior, with no legitimate purpose apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is highly malicious, designed as a comprehensive data stealer targeting Discord tokens, credentials, cookies, files, and system information. It exfiltrates data covertly through webhooks and file uploads, terminates security-sensitive processes, and includes self-installation and persistence mechanisms. Its structure and behavior clearly indicate malicious intent, with no legitimate or benign purpose.",
