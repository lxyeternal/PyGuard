{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a comprehensive malicious data stealer targeting Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, system info, and files. It decrypts stored credentials, collects user data from browsers and applications, and exfiltrates this information via webhooks and file uploads. It also terminates related processes to access locked data and uses threading for concurrent operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from browser storage files, local application data directories, Discord local state files, and database files such as 'Login Data'. It also captures environment variables, environment-specific files, and network responses for geolocation and user info.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into network requests to webhooks and file hosting services ('gofile.io', 'anonfiles'), as well as into system commands (e.g., 'taskkill') and file writes for logs and exfiltrated data. Data is exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests and file uploads, often encoded or encrypted, then sent to external servers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as browser databases, local storage, environment variables, and network responses, through decryption and parsing functions, into exfiltration functions that send data via requests or upload files. Process termination and decryption functions act as control points, ensuring data access and transfer.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes hardcoded webhook URLs, silent module installation commands, process-killing commands for browsers and applications, and dynamic regex patterns for token extraction. It also performs extensive data collection without legitimate user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script decrypts stored credentials using Windows APIs, extracts tokens from various sources, collects cookies and passwords from browser databases, and gathers system info. It terminates processes related to browsers and applications to access data, zips relevant files, and uploads data via web requests to external servers. Threading is used for parallel data collection and exfiltration. The code contains hardcoded webhooks and performs silent module installations, all typical of malware designed for stealth and data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a credential, token, and data stealer with active exfiltration channels. It employs multiple techniques to evade detection, including process termination, silent dependency installation, and data encryption/decryption. The overall behavior confirms high malicious intent and high security risk.",
