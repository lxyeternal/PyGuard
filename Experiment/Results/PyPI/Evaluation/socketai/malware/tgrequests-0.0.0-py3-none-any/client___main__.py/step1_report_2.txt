{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for extracting sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various applications and browsers, then uploading this data to a remote server or Discord webhook. It also includes functionalities for zipping and exfiltrating files from the system, suggesting malicious intent to compromise user privacy and security.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from browser data files (e.g., Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge), application storage directories (e.g., Steam, Riot Client, Exodus, Atomic Wallet), Discord local storage, and user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It extracts tokens, passwords, cookies, and files based on predefined paths and regex patterns.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows include sending collected tokens, passwords, cookies, and files via HTTP POST requests to a Discord webhook and to anonfiles for file hosting. Data such as tokens, passwords, and cookies are uploaded or sent to remote servers, which constitutes data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The code collects data from local application storage, decrypts sensitive information (tokens, passwords, cookies), then uploads or posts this data to remote servers via web requests. It also zips files and uploads the archives, with functions designed to automate exfiltration from user directories and application data folders.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes several suspicious behaviors: attempting to install Python modules without user consent, decrypting Windows credentials, harvesting tokens and sensitive data from multiple sources, sending data to external webhooks, zipping and uploading files from user directories, and using threading for parallel data collection. Also, it kills processes related to specific applications (e.g., Metamask) and accesses system files without clear legitimate purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive credential and data stealer. It targets popular browsers and applications to extract stored tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive information. The script decrypts encrypted data using Windows-specific APIs and master keys. It uploads the collected information to a Discord webhook configured with a hardcoded URL, indicating an exfiltration channel. The code also searches user directories for files containing keywords related to accounts, passwords, and crypto wallets, then zips and uploads them. It attempts to silently install modules, kill processes, and exfiltrate files without user knowledge. These behaviors collectively demonstrate malicious intent to harvest user data, bypass security, and transmit it remotely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a malicious credential and data exfiltration tool, designed to silently harvest tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from user systems, then send this data to remote servers via webhooks and file hosting services. Its behaviors include decrypting sensitive data, accessing user directories, killing processes, and uploading data without user consent, confirming malicious intent with high confidence.",
