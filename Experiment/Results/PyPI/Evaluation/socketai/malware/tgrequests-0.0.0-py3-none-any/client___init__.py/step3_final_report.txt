  "purpose": "A trivial Python function with a comment referencing a potentially suspicious URL.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, input, or environment variables; only a comment referencing 'github.com/codeuk/evilpip'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, no external connections, no data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only prints a message.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment referencing 'github.com/codeuk/evilpip', which could be suspicious but is non-executable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple function that does nothing harmful; no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The only anomaly is the comment referencing an external URL, which is not used in execution. Scores reflect the benign nature: malware score 0, obfuscated 0, security risk slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) due to the comment. Confidence in benignity is high (around 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent. The comment referencing 'evilpip' is suspicious but does not impact execution or security. Scores are appropriate; no modifications necessary.",
