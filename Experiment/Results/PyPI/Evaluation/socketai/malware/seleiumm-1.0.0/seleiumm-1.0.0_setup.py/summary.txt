  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior through encrypted payload execution during installation, obfuscation tactics, and conditional targeting of Windows systems. The absence of detailed analysis in the reports is a significant oversight. Based on the code, the package should be flagged as highly malicious with high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores."
