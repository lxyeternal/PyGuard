      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The stealthy nature and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting a high security risk rating. The scores in most reports are appropriate, but the risk and malware scores should be increased to reflect the potential danger."
