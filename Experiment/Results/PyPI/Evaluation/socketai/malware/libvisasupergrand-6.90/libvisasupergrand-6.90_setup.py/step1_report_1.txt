{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup script for a Python package named 'libvisasupergrand', intended to install a package with certain metadata. However, it also includes suspicious code that executes hidden PowerShell commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment and filesystem data (e.g., os.path.exists), and executes a subprocess with a PowerShell command encoded in base64.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes an encoded PowerShell command, which could be used to run malicious code or establish backdoors.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the existence of a file 'tahg', then runs a hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, which could be used to download or execute malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes executing an encoded PowerShell command in a hidden window without user consent. The PowerShell command is base64 encoded, which is a common obfuscation technique. The use of 'try...except' blocks around setup code suppresses errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily functions as a package setup script, but the presence of a base64-encoded PowerShell command that runs in hidden mode is highly suspicious. The command likely performs malicious actions, such as downloading or executing remote scripts. The code’s structure suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activity within a legitimate setup process. The rest of the code simply defines package metadata, which by itself is benign, but the malicious code outweighs this benign aspect.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior hidden within a package setup process. The encoded PowerShell command executed silently suggests an attempt to compromise the host system. Given the obfuscation and malicious potential, this code should be considered highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
