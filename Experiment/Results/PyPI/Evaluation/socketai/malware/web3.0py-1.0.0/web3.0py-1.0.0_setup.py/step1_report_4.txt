{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with a custom install command that decrypts and executes embedded code if on a Windows system.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment detection via os.name, encrypted data within Fernet decryption, and package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the execution of decrypted code via exec(), and the use of imported modules (requests, Fernet).",
  "flows": "Input detection triggers decryption, which then is executed directly via exec(), constituting a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted data decrypted and executed dynamically, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The code does not reveal the actual payload, raising suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package. It customizes the install command to check if the OS is Windows, then proceeds to decrypt a hardcoded encrypted string using Fernet and executes the decrypted code via exec(). The encrypted data is likely payload or malicious script. The use of exec() on decrypted data poses a significant security risk, indicating malicious intent. The rest of the setup code appears standard, with no other suspicious behavior. The code does not include any validation or checks to verify the decrypted payload, making it highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload that is decrypted and executed during installation on Windows systems, representing a high security risk. This behavior is typical of malicious package supply chain attacks intended to run arbitrary code during install.",
