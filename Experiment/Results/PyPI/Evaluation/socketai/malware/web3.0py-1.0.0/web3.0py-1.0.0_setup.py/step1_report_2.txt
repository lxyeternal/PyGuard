{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package setup with a custom installation command that executes decrypted code during installation, potentially maliciously.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'os' module to check the operating system; the custom 'run' method in the install class imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, and executes decrypted code via exec().",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code, which can perform any malicious action such as data exfiltration, system modification, or establishing backdoors.",
  "flows": "During installation, if on Windows, the code imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then executes decrypted code via exec(), creating a flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "The long description and version string appear as random, nonsensical strings, indicating obfuscation or payload concealment. The custom install class decrypts and executes code without transparency. The code decrypts and executes code during setup, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a package with a custom install command. The custom class 'eoIiHgeWTfucbOwcRSYvjFeiLYBBTnYgEppoIXyaxLetGCuIpXUQfXGaiCasYKndjbkpaUjQTKiYg' overrides the run() method. On Windows, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' and decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string, then executes it via exec(). The long description and version contain random or obfuscated strings. The decrypted code's purpose is unknown but executing decrypted code at install time is highly suspicious, as it can perform malicious activities such as code injection, data theft, or establishing backdoors. The code does not validate or inspect the decrypted payload, posing a security risk. The 'setup_requires' includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are typical dependencies but also could be involved in malicious payload delivery or exfiltration. Overall, the code demonstrates obfuscation and malicious behavior potential.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains obfuscated, potentially malicious code that decrypts and executes code during installation, representing a high security risk. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack tactics to run arbitrary code during package installation.",
