  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior, with active decryption and execution of code during package installation on Windows. The embedded encrypted payload and use of exec() are classic indicators of malware or backdoor activity. The high malware score (approaching 1), high security risk, and obfuscation are justified. This package should be flagged and avoided until further analysis confirms its safety."
