{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'Matplotblib', including custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports modules ('os', 'requests', 'fernet'), and reads the embedded encrypted string for decryption.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code, which could be malicious if the decrypted content is harmful.",
  "flows": "The code decrypts data using Fernet, then executes it with exec(), creating a source-to-sink flow where decrypted code is run directly.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted string and dynamic execution via exec() are suspicious. The code decrypts and executes code conditionally based on OS, which is unusual for standard setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a custom install class. In the custom install class, if the OS is Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded Fernet key and ciphertext, executing the decrypted code with exec(). The setup() function registers this custom class for installation. The use of encrypted code and dynamic execution is suspicious, as it could hide malicious payloads. The rest of the code appears typical for a setup script, but the embedded decryption and exec() are high-risk behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious behavior: decrypting and executing code during installation based on the OS. This pattern is commonly used to conceal malicious actions. The code likely aims to run hidden code on Windows systems, which is highly suspicious and warrants caution.",
