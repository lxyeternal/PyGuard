  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'Matplotblib' with custom installation behavior that decrypts and executes code on Windows systems during installation.",
  "sources": "os.name check, import statements (requests, fernet), decryption and execution of Fernet-encrypted code, package metadata, setup configuration",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, potentially executing malicious code during installation on Windows systems",
  "flows": "os.name check -> import requests and Fernet -> decrypt and execute code via exec() if on Windows -> proceed with package setup",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload executed via exec() during installation, hardcoded Fernet key and ciphertext, code executes dynamic code during install which is unusual and suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup with setuptools, but includes a custom install command class that checks if the OS is Windows ('nt'). If so, it imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes code embedded in the script via exec(). The encrypted payload is hardcoded, which is unusual and suspicious. The execution of decrypted code during installation on Windows can be malicious, potentially executing arbitrary code, backdoors, or malware. The rest of the setup configuration appears typical, but the inclusion of this runtime code raises significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious payload that decrypts and executes code during installation on Windows systems. This behavior indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent and represents a serious security risk. The hardcoded encrypted code and its execution suggest intent to hide malicious activities.",
