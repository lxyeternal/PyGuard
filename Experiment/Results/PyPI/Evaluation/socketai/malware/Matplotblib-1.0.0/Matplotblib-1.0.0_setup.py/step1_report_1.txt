  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'Matplotblib', configuring installation and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.name), importing modules (requests, fernet), decrypting and executing code via Fernet key.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, which could run arbitrary or malicious code if decrypted content is malicious.",
  "flows": "If os.name == 'nt', requests and Fernet are imported, then Fernet decrypts data and executes it via exec(), potentially executing malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Fernet encryption and exec() within an installation command, conditional on os.name being 'nt'. The decryption key and encrypted payload are embedded in code, indicating possible concealment. The class name and variable names are obfuscated. The description fields contain random strings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a payload with Fernet using a hardcoded key, and executes the decrypted code via exec(). The decryption and execution of code during package installation is highly suspicious, as it can run arbitrary code, potentially malicious. The encrypted payload and key are embedded in the code, indicating obfuscation or malicious intent. The use of exec() with decrypted data constitutes a high-risk behavior. The rest of the setup code appears normal but is overshadowed by this malicious-looking behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated, malicious-looking behavior: during Windows installation, it decrypts and executes arbitrary code via Fernet and exec(). This behavior is indicative of malicious activity or backdoor functionality. The presence of encrypted payloads and dynamic code execution during setup is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
