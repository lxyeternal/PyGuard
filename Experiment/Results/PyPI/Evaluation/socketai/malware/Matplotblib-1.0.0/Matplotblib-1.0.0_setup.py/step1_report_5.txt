{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'Matplotblib' with specific metadata and a custom installation routine that executes obfuscated code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), imports requests and fernet libraries, and executes decrypted code via exec().",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code which can lead to arbitrary code execution if decrypted content is malicious.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves checking if the OS is Windows, then decrypting and executing code using Fernet, which could lead to remote code execution if the decryption key or encrypted payload is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names and encrypted code executed via exec(). The decryption key and payload are hardcoded, and code only executes on Windows. The purpose appears to be executing encrypted code during installation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and a custom install class that, when run on Windows, imports requests and Fernet, decrypts an encrypted payload with a hardcoded key, and executes it via exec(). The presence of encrypted, decrypted, and dynamically executed code strongly suggests an attempt to hide malicious behavior or backdoor functionality. This pattern is commonly associated with malicious packages designed to execute arbitrary code during installation. The code does not perform any legitimate or transparent operations beyond package setup, indicating suspicious intent. The decryption key and payload are hardcoded, increasing the risk of malicious activity. The overall structure and use of obfuscation techniques indicate potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated code that decrypts and executes potentially malicious code during installation on Windows systems. The use of hardcoded decryption keys and encrypted payloads to execute code via exec() is highly suspicious and typical of malicious package behavior. The overall security risk is high, and the package should not be used.",
