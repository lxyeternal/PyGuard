{
  "purpose": "The code decrypts and executes a payload during Windows installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from hardcoded encrypted payload and Fernet key within the script.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "Source: hardcoded encrypted payload and key -> decryption with Fernet -> execution via exec() on Windows (os.name == 'nt')",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names, embedded encrypted payload and key, conditional execution only on Windows, and runtime code execution via exec().",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that, during Windows setup, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded payload with a hardcoded Fernet key, and executes the decrypted code via exec(). The obfuscated class name and long description strings suggest concealment. The pattern of decrypting and executing code during installation is a common tactic for malicious backdoors or malware. The encrypted payload and key are embedded, and the execution is conditional on Windows OS, indicating targeted malicious activity. The use of exec() with decrypted code is a high-risk behavior, potentially allowing remote code execution or backdoor installation. The obfuscation and encrypted payloads further support malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior, with active decryption and execution of code during package installation on Windows. The embedded encrypted payload and use of exec() are classic indicators of malware or backdoor activity. The high malware score (approaching 1), high security risk, and obfuscation are justified. This package should be flagged and avoided until further analysis confirms its safety.",
