  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task or function, but the exact intent is unclear without further context or descriptive comments.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from environment variables, command line arguments, or possibly network connections (if present). The typical sources are environment variables, user inputs, or external data files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file system writes, or execution of dynamic code. Look for functions that send data over the network, write to files, or execute code dynamically.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input, environment, network) to sinks (network, file, execution), possibly passing through transformations or checks. Any direct or indirect untrusted data reaching sinks without validation is suspicious.",
  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded credentials, base64-encoded data, obfuscated code, dynamic execution (eval, exec), or unusual imports could indicate malicious intent. Unusual variable names or unnecessary complexity also raise concerns.",
  "analysis": "Initial review shows standard library usage with no obvious obfuscation. No clear hardcoded secrets or network connections are visible. Dynamic code execution or malicious network behavior is not evident. Code appears straightforward, but without detailed context or external data, some risks may be hidden. No indicators of malware such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or cryptomining are apparent. The overall structure does not show signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the code provided, there is no evident malicious behavior or high-security risk. The code appears benign with standard functionality. However, due to the lack of detailed context, a low to moderate confidence score is assigned for the absence of hidden malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
