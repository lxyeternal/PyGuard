  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform standard data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be determined without actual code content.",
  "sources": "Input functions or data read points such as 'input()', reading from files, environment variables, or network requests.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous operations such as executing 'exec()', 'eval()', system commands via 'os.system' or 'subprocess', writing to files, or network communication functions.",
  "flows": "Paths where data from sources flows into sinks, especially if unvalidated or unsanitized.",
  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded credentials, unusual obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or inconsistent variable naming patterns.",
  "analysis": "The analysis cannot be fully completed without the actual code. Key steps include inspecting the initial code for data input points, checking for unsafe handling of untrusted data, evaluating the presence of dynamic execution or network communication, and identifying any hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns. No such details are provided here, so this remains a placeholder for a thorough review.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of specific code content, no definitive malicious behavior can be identified. The code appears benign but requires full review of the actual source to confirm. No obvious signs of malware or security risks are evident from the provided information.",
