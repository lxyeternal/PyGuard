{
  "purpose": "Provides asyncio-based functions to establish SOCKS proxy connections, including URL parsing, socket creation, and connection management.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL input in parse_proxy_url; host and port parameters in open_connection and create_connection; external socket wrapper classes.",
  "sinks": "Socket connect method; asyncio.open_connection and loop.create_connection calls that establish network connections.",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url extracts proxy type, host, port, username, password -> create_socket_wrapper creates socket -> connect() called on socket -> connection established via asyncio functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Error handling is standard. No data leaks or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code parses proxy URLs, creates SOCKS proxy sockets, and establishes connections asynchronously. It handles untrusted inputs with basic validation, relies on external libraries for proxy handling, and performs no malicious actions. No obfuscation or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions are straightforward, with proper error handling. The security implications are minimal, primarily related to untrusted input handling, which is typical for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation for establishing SOCKS proxy connections in an asyncio environment. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified, and the slight security risk score reflects minimal inherent risk due to untrusted inputs. Overall, the code appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
