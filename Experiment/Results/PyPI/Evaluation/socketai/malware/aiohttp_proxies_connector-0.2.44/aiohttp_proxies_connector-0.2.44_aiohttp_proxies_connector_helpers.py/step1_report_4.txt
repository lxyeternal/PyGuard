{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to create and open network connections through SOCKS proxies, including URL parsing and socket wrapping.",
  "sources": "Reads input from 'raw_url' in parse_proxy_url, and from parameters such as socks_url, host, port, username, password, and loop.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted data from URLs and parameters to establish network connections via proxy sockets.",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url extracts proxy info from raw_url -> create_socket_wrapper creates socket object -> open_connection/create_connection use socket to connect to target host and port -> asyncio.open_connection or loop.create_connection transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code facilitates establishing network connections through SOCKS proxies, parsing proxy URLs, and wrapping sockets accordingly. It includes standard error handling for invalid inputs. No signs of malicious data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. Usage of standard libraries and patterns suggests typical application logic. No suspicious behaviors like network data leaks, unauthorized data collection, or malicious command execution are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing SOCKS proxy connections with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It correctly handles inputs and establishes connections without suspicious behavior.",
