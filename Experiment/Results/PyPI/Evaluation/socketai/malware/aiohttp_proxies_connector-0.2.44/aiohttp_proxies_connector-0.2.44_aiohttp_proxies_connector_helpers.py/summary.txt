  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation for establishing SOCKS proxy connections in an asyncio environment. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified, and the slight security risk score reflects minimal inherent risk due to untrusted inputs. Overall, the code appears safe and well-structured for its purpose."
