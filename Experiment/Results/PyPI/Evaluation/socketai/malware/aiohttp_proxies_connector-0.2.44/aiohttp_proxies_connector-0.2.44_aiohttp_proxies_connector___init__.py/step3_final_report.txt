  "purpose": "Module setup for a SOCKS proxy library, importing components and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static module setup.",
  "flows": "Importing components -> exporting via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard module initialization with no runtime logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes, functions, and error definitions, sets a version string, and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reviews correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero, consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores and assessments across all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
