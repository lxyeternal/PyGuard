  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, code logic, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\n- It is a simple module that imports classes, functions, and error definitions from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).\n- It defines a version string and exports symbols via `__all__`.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present.\n- The code appears to be a standard package initialization or interface setup.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Describes the module as part of a SOCKS proxy client/server, defining imports and exports.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is just setting up the module interface, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing module setup for a proxy library.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that no untrusted data handling or malicious activity is present.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=1\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, focusing on SOCKS proxy component organization.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that this is a standard module initializer with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=1\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Describes the module as facilitating proxy connection creation and error management.\n- **Analysis:** No untrusted data or malicious code detected; the code is purely import/export setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=1\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, providing a SOCKS proxy client setup.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity or obfuscation; standard module organization.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=1\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code logic:** All reports correctly identify that this code is just module setup with no runtime logic, data processing, or network activity.\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, since there's no evident security risk or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- Since no suspicious or malicious behavior is detected, I agree with the provided scores.\n- The reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy library, with no signs of supply chain attack vectors or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.
