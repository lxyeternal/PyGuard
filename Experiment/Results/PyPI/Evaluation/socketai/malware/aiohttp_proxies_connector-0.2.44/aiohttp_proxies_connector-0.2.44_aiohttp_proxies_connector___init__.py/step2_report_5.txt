  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a simple Python module that imports various components from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), sets a version string, and defines an `__all__` list for exports.\n   - There are no functions, network operations, data handling, or dynamic code execution present.\n   - The code appears to be an `__init__.py` or similar setup file, primarily organizing exports.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is visible.\n   - The code does not handle untrusted data, perform network I/O, or execute code dynamically.\n   - The import statements and symbol exports are standard for a Python package.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or security risks.\n   - They assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0.\n   - The confidence level is high (1) in all reports, which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious behavior is indicated.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is appropriate. No obfuscation or hidden code is present.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 is justified, as the code does not perform any risky operations or contain vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports are based solely on static code analysis of this small snippet, which is appropriate here.\n   - No assumptions about the behavior of imported modules can be made from this snippet alone, but since this is a module setup file, it’s unlikely to contain malicious code.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is benign, standard module initialization code.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code content.\n   - No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is safe and free from malicious or suspicious behavior.",
