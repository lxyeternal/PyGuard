  "purpose": "This module appears to define and expose components related to a SOCKS proxy connection, including error handling, connection helpers, and proxy type definitions.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and specific classes/functions from local package files: connector, errors, helpers, and proto.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; the code primarily handles module imports, constants, and exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks is observable; the code mainly establishes namespace and version info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a typical module initializer, importing components, defining version info, and exporting symbols. It does not execute any untrusted input or perform any network or file operations. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident from this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily organizes imports and exports for a SOCKS proxy package.",
