{
  "purpose": "This module provides imports and exports related to a SOCKS proxy connection handling library, facilitating proxy connection creation and error management.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up imports and exposes symbols",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; no hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules and defines module metadata (__version__ and __all__). It does not process any input data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The structure appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py or similar setup file. No code injection, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup that only re-exports symbols for external use. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment.",
