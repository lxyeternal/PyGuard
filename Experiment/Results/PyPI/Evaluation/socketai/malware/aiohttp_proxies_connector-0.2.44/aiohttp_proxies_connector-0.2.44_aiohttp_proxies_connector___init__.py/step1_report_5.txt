{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that provides a SOCKS proxy client with related classes, errors, and helper functions for establishing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and module metadata (__version__, __all__)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output functions observed",
  "flows": "Imports and exports only; no data flow or data processing occurs within this code fragment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code structures observed; code is standard module setup",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes, error definitions, and helper functions from local files. It defines module metadata (__version__, __all__) for public API exposure. There are no data processing, input reading, or untrusted data handling operations present. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or malicious behavior are evident. The code structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, organizing exports for external use.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a module initializer for a SOCKS proxy library, exporting relevant classes and functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this fragment. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
