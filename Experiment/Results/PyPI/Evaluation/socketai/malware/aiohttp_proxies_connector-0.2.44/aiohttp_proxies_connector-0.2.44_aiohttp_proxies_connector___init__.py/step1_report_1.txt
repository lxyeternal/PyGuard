{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a part of a SOCKS proxy client or server implementation, defining imports and exporting symbols related to proxy connection handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), likely reading configuration, error definitions, and connection functions.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or data leaks directly in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no runtime data flow present as this code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The versioning and symbol exports are typical for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of import statements, module metadata (__version__, __all__). No data processing, input handling, or network operations are present. It appears to be a standard module interface setup without suspicious or malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only sets up exports for other parts of the package. No evidence of malware or security issues detected.",
