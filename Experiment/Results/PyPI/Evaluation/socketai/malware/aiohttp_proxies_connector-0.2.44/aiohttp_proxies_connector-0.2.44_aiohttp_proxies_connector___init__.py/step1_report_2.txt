{
  "purpose": "This code defines module imports, versioning, and exports for a proxy-related library, likely used to facilitate network connections through proxies.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto). No external input reading occurs within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only imports modules and sets exports. There are no functions or operations that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or execution logic is present beyond imports and variable definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns. The code is straightforward, typical of Python module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles module imports, error definitions, and setting module metadata and exports. It does not perform data processing, network operations, or input handling. All imported modules and variables appear standard for a network proxy library. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated segments. The presence of versioning and __all__ exports is typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard module setup code with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It merely organizes and exposes components for a proxy-related Python package.",
