  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is standard, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, indicating the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9), suggesting the reviewers are certain about their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n**Code Functionality:**\n- The code defines a custom proxy connector supporting HTTP and other proxy types, with optional rDNS, credential handling, and custom DNS resolution.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious URL/IP addresses.\n- Socket creation via `create_socket_wrapper` appears standard; no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- Proxy URL construction and request modification are standard procedures.\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n- The only point of concern could be the `create_socket_wrapper` function, but since its implementation isn't provided, we cannot assess its security. However, the reports treat it as a normal utility, and no suspicious activity is claimed.\n- The use of a custom `NoResolver` is not inherently malicious; it may be for custom DNS handling.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justifications:\n\n- **Malware Score (0):** No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** Code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score (~0.1–0.2):** Low, consistent with standard proxy handling code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores seem appropriate given the evidence.\n- No adjustments needed unless new information about `create_socket_wrapper` or other external functions indicates malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** (confirmed no malicious activity)  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** (code is straightforward)  \n**Risk Score:** **0.1–0.2** (low risk, standard implementation)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Issues Confirmed:** None.\n- **Logical Flaws or Mistakes:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate and consistent.\n- **Overall Security Posture:** Safe, legitimate proxy connection code with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, secure implementation of a proxy connector with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk scores are justified, and no further action is necessary based on the provided information.",
