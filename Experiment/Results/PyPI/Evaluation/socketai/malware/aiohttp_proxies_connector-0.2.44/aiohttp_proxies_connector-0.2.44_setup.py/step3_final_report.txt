{
  "purpose": "The code decodes multiple large base64-encoded scripts, writes them to temporary files, and executes them stealthily using subprocess with hidden window flags. The embedded scripts contain functions for environment inspection, network requests, further decoding, and covert execution, indicative of malicious payload delivery and stealthy operation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (USERPROFILE), sys.argv, base64-encoded strings embedded in the code, files written to temporary directories.",
  "sinks": "Writes decoded scripts to files in temp directories, executes scripts via subprocess with hidden flags, potentially runs malicious payloads or backdoors in background processes.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and command-line args → base64 decoding → writing scripts to temp files → executing scripts via subprocess with hidden flags → potential network or malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy use of base64 encoding for scripts, multiple layers of decoding, dynamic execution of code, writing files to temp directories, stealth execution flags, no clear legitimate purpose, obfuscated code routines.",
  "analysis": "The code decodes large base64 strings into Python scripts, writes them into a temp directory, and executes them via subprocess with hidden window flags. The embedded scripts include functions for environment info collection, network requests, further decoding, and stealthy execution. The pattern of decoding, writing, and executing code in a concealed manner, combined with extensive obfuscation, strongly suggests malicious intent. The code does not perform any transparent, benign operations and employs techniques typical of malware loaders or backdoors, such as layered encoding, dynamic code execution, and stealth process spawning.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, characterized by heavy obfuscation, dynamic decoding, stealthy execution, and embedded payloads. It is consistent with malware designed for covert operations, data exfiltration, or remote control. The malware score is set to 1, obfuscation to 1, and security risk to 1, reflecting the high threat level and malicious nature of the code.",
