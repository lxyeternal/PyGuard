  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The code appears benign and purely structural.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports uniformly state that there are no anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious patterns. Given the code provided, this is accurate. The reasoning is consistent and correctly identifies that these are standard exception class definitions with no embedded logic or hidden code.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0. These are appropriate given the nature of the code. Since the code is just exception class definitions, these scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   No report suggests any reason to assign a higher risk score. The code is straightforward and standard for error handling, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of any malicious logic or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as harmless exception definitions.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code's content.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nThe code is a simple, standard set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n- **Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Estimated risk score:** **0**\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, safe implementation of custom exception classes for network error handling. No malicious or suspicious elements are present, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
