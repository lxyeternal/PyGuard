  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. Based on the provided code, there are no issues such as malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and typical for error handling. They do not identify any logical flaws or suspicious patterns. This assessment appears accurate given the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature.  \n   \n   These scores seem reasonable and justified based on the code content.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely exception class definitions with no embedded logic, no data handling, and no malicious behavior, higher risk scores are unwarranted. The current scores of 0 or 0.5 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   Given that the code contains only class definitions for error handling, there's no indication of malicious intent. The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n   All reports correctly avoid speculative claims about vulnerabilities, focusing solely on the code's structural nature.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the reports:**  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports, reflecting the benign and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThese scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, non-malicious set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and should remain as is.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the existing scores and assessments. No changes are necessary.",
