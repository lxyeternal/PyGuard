  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors related to SOCKS proxy connections and authentication.",
  "sources": "No input reading or external data sources; only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling; solely class inheritance definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class definitions with no embedded code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard Python exception types. There are no data input, processing, or external communications. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. All classes serve as error indicators related to SOCKS proxy operations and do not perform any actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of exception class definitions intended for error handling within a SOCKS proxy module. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies detected. The code is benign and purely structural.",
