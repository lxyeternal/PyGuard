{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data sources; purely class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; just class inheritance structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from base exception classes, establishing a hierarchy for SOCKS-related errors. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing logic that could be exploited or indicate malicious intent. The code appears to serve as a structured way to handle exceptions in a SOCKS proxy context without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in a SOCKS proxy implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks present.",
