{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues, serving as error handling components in a network proxy library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exception types; no external data sources or input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions; purely structural class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are standalone definitions with no runtime data or logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions, with no embedded logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The code is typical for error handling in network modules and shows no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content, indicating negligible supply chain risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
