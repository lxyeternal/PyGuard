{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy and connection errors.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; only class definitions for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; exception classes do not process external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; code only defines exception subclasses without logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; classes are simple exception definitions with no embedded behavior or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class declarations for different SOCKS and proxy-related errors. There are no functions, data handling, or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The structure and content are typical for error handling in network-related Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for error handling related to SOCKS proxy connections. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and appears safe.",
