  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no functions, data handling, or external data sources involved.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign, straightforward exception class definitions.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - They appropriately conclude that the code is safe and contains no malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n     - confidence: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely exception class definitions with no logic, no data processing, and no external interactions, the security risk should remain at 0.\n   - No reason exists to assign a higher risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that there is no malware present.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they do not speculate about potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** Only exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors.\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior).\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present).\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified).\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard exception handling classes with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted.",
