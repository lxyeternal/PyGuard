{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains class definitions and does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists, as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines multiple custom exception classes, inheriting from built-in exception types. There are no external data sources, no input handling, no logic, and no suspicious or malicious code present. No backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The structure is typical for a library handling SOCKS proxy errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for a SOCKS proxy library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no security risks, and is purely structural.",
