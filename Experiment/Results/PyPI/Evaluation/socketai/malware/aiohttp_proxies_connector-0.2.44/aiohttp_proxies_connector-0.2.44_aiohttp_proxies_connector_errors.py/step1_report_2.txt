{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; only class definitions for exception handling.",
  "targets": "No sinks or data flows present; no untrusted data handling or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or input-to-output paths; solely class inheritance for exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; straightforward exception class declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of class definitions inheriting from standard exception types, serving as custom exceptions for SOCKS proxy-related errors. There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic present. The classes do not perform any operations beyond inheritance. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are detectable. The code appears to be part of a larger exception handling framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy errors. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks within these definitions. It is a standard practice for structured exception handling.",
