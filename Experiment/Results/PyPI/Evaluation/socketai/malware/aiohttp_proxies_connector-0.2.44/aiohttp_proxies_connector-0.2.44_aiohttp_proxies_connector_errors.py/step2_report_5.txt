  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\nAll reports confirm that the code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. There are no functions, data processing, external data sources, or sinks. The classes inherit from standard exceptions, and no embedded logic or behavior exists beyond class declaration.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious Behavior or Anomalies**:\nNo anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a standard practice for structured error handling in network modules.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of any malicious code or behavior.\n- **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, aligning with the straightforward class definitions.\n- **Confidence**: All reports have a confidence of 1, indicating certainty that the code is safe and benign.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Issues**:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is purely structural exception definitions with no malicious or suspicious content.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound, emphasizing the lack of data flow, logic, or external interactions.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n- Since the code is only exception class definitions, it cannot be malicious on its own. However, in a supply chain context, the concern would be whether these classes are being used maliciously elsewhere or if they are part of a compromised package. Based solely on this code snippet, there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (all zeros for malware and security risk) are appropriate.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and standard for error handling.\n- No changes needed to the scores or reasoning.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0, 0, and 0 respectively.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code poses no security threat based on the provided snippet. The supply chain risk is minimal, and the exception classes are typical and benign.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Security Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
