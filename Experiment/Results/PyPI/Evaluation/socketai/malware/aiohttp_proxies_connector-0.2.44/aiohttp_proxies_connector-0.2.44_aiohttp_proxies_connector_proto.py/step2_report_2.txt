  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard, straightforward implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. Credentials are used solely for proxy authentication.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, which seems reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n- **Justification:** The detailed reasoning aligns with the code's functionality—it's a proxy client library, not an exploit or malware.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard proxy connection procedures, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and legitimate handling of credentials.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n- **Justification:** The reasoning matches the code's structure and purpose.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's evaluation and scores are justified and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a typical SOCKS proxy client implementation, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Credentials are used for authentication only.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n- **Justification:** The analysis aligns with the code's straightforward functionality.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy wrapper, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors. It handles untrusted data in socket communication but does not exhibit malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n- **Justification:** The low risk score is appropriate given the code's benign purpose.\n\n**Assessment:** The evaluation and scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard implementation for establishing SOCKS proxy connections, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; the code is typical proxy client code.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores and conclusions are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's nature. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's purpose, the low risk scores are justified. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — The code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — The code is clear and standard, no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Slightly above zero, reflecting that the code handles network data and credentials, but these are standard for such functionality and do not pose significant security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and justified. The code is a typical, secure implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate.",
