  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the issues, scores, and conclusions are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The malware score is 0, and security risk is low (0.2).\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code performs proxy negotiation, hostname resolution, and optional authentication, all standard. No suspicious data flows or hidden behaviors are evident.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate. Security risk 0.2 seems reasonable given the network operations involved but no malicious intent.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a straightforward SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity. Malware score is 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. It handles proxy negotiation, authentication, and address resolution properly.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0 is justified. Security risk is low, considering the potential for credential handling but nothing malicious.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a standard SOCKS proxy client with no malicious intent. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code manages network connections, authentication, and address resolution securely and transparently.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate. The security risk is minimal.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy wrapper with no suspicious behaviors. Malware score is 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0 fits. Security risk is low.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard SOCKS proxy implementation with no malicious activity. Malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. No signs of sabotage or malicious data handling.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0 is appropriate. Security risk remains low.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall analysis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's functionality. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), reflecting the network operations involved but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the scores assigned in all reports. The code is a standard, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client library, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to network operations and credential handling but no malicious activity)\n\n**Summary:** The code is legitimate, secure, and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
