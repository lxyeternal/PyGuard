{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions to establish proxy connections via SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, supporting asynchronous socket communication.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostnames, ports, and optional credentials for authentication, primarily in the _resolve_addr, connect, and _build_dest_address methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are socket send and receive functions (sock_sendall, sock_recv), which handle data transmissions that could include sensitive information, and socket connection establishment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (hostnames, ports, credentials) through address resolution, authentication, and SOCKS protocol negotiation, ultimately leading to data transmission over the established socket connection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code performs standard proxy negotiation; however, it does handle optional user credentials. No obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The exception handling seems standard for network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of asynchronous SOCKS proxy wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with support for authentication and DNS resolution. It manages network connections and protocol negotiation securely. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The functions are logically structured, with proper exception handling. The only potential concern is the handling of credentials, which are transmitted during authentication but this is standard behavior for SOCKS5 authentication. Overall, the code appears benign and designed solely for proxy communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard SOCKS proxy client functionality with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It properly handles network operations, authentication, and protocol compliance without including suspicious or malicious code. The malware score is low, and security risk is minimal.",
