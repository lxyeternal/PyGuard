{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers, handling connection negotiation, authentication, and address resolution for network proxying.",
  "sources": "Host and port inputs for proxy server and destination address; socket operations for data transmission and reception.",
  "sinks": "Socket send and receive functions that handle network data; potential data leaks if credentials or sensitive info are mishandled, but standard for proxy clients.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, credentials) are processed through address resolution and authentication routines, then transmitted via socket connections to the proxy and destination; data flows from source inputs through socket operations to network endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code follows standard proxy client design without suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy protocols, with proper handling of hostname resolution, authentication, and socket communication. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The credential handling is typical for proxy authentication, and network operations are standard. The error handling and connection management follow best practices. Overall, the code appears secure and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no malicious or suspicious features. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2), consistent with its network communication purpose. No modifications are necessary.",
