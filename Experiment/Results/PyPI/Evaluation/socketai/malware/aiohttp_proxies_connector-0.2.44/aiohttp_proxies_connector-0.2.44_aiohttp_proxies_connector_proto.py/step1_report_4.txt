{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connection wrappers with support for asynchronous operations, facilitating network proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hostnames, ports, and optional user credentials for proxy authentication; data is also read from network responses during negotiation and connection.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow into network communication functions, especially via socket operations, potentially affecting the proxy negotiation process or data transmission.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to network socket operations, including DNS resolution, proxy negotiation requests, and responses, with potential flow of untrusted data during negotiation and connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with standard proxy negotiation logic; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious data handling detected. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variables are present. Exception handling is appropriate for network errors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for SOCKS proxy handling, including connection and negotiation methods with appropriate error handling. It includes address resolution, protocol negotiation, and authentication logic. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity, are present. All data flows are confined to standard proxy communication procedures. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors are detected. The code follows expected patterns for a proxy client implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio-based Python applications. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It functions as intended for proxy connection management with proper error handling and does not include any suspicious or malicious code.",
