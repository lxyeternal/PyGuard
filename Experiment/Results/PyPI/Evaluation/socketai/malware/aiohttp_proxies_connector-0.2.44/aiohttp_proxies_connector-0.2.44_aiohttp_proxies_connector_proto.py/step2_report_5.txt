  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy implementation, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the detailed analysis. The low risk score is appropriate given the code's purpose and lack of suspicious behavior.\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed. The risk and malware scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirming standard proxy client behavior with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the detailed reasoning. No issues detected.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SOCKS proxy client implementation, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning matches the code's functionality.\n- **Recommendation:** No adjustments needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard SOCKS proxy code with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower risk score, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Recommendation:** No change necessary.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports, standard implementation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, matching the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2) is justified, reflecting minimal security concern due to the code's purpose.\n\n### Final Personal Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious intent detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, standard network proxy code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments are necessary. The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
