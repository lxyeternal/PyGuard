{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes for establishing SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections asynchronously, with support for authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads input from parameters such as host, port, username, password, and DNS resolution functions. Also reads from network sockets during negotiation and data transfer.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over network sockets during connection negotiation, authentication, and data transmission. Receives data from network sockets for responses and address parsing.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> _build_dest_address/_socks_auth -> send data via _send -> receive responses via _receive -> process responses and establish connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are evident. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected. Exception handling is standard for network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements SOCKS proxy client logic with asynchronous socket handling, address resolution, and optional authentication. It performs standard network communication sequences, including connecting to a proxy server, negotiating protocol versions, authenticating if credentials are provided, and establishing a connection to the target address. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modifications, or hidden backdoors. All data handling appears to be standard for proxy connection setup. Error handling aligns with expected patterns, and there are no unusual or suspicious operations beyond typical network communication routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients with no malicious intent. It handles network connections, protocol negotiation, and optional authentication securely. No indicators of malware or malicious activity are present.",
