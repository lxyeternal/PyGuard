{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols for establishing proxy connections asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Data sources include network addresses resolved via getaddrinfo, input parameters for connection (host, port, user credentials), and data received from proxy servers during negotiation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are socket send and receive functions, especially where untrusted data (from proxy responses or inputs) may influence subsequent operations. The code does not directly write to files or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through address resolution and proxy negotiation functions, with socket communication handling request and response data during connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code uses standard socket and asyncio functions for network operations. No obfuscated code features detected. Exception handling is conventional. No unusual dynamic execution or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes proxy connections using SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols. It performs address resolution and manages socket connections asynchronously. Error handling is thorough, raising specific exceptions for connection issues or protocol errors. It validates protocol versions and response codes, and supports remote or local DNS resolution as configured. There are no signs of malicious data manipulation, code injection, or data exfiltration. Usage of standard libraries and clear exception handling indicate legitimate functionality. The code's behavior aligns with typical proxy socket wrappers, with no indicators of sabotage or malware. All operations are limited to network communication and socket management, with no suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for asyncio-based Python applications. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It functions solely for establishing proxy connections with proper validation and error handling.",
