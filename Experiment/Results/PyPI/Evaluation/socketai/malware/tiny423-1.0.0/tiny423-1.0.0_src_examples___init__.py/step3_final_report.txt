  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, network sockets, files, system commands.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network transmissions, file operations, database interactions.",
  "flows": "Input to processing functions, environment variables to system calls, network data to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence or minimal presence of code. Reports 1, 2, 4, and 5 note missing code, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk, which is appropriate. Report 3 provides limited code context and concludes benign behavior with low confidence (0.4) and low risk (0.2), consistent with the evidence. Report 5's high confidence (0.8) appears inflated given no code; it should be lowered to reflect the lack of content. Overall, the scores are consistent with the provided descriptions, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code shows no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scoring across reports is appropriate, with minimal risk and malware likelihood. The only adjustment needed is to lower the confidence score in Report 5 to better match the absence of code. Overall, the supply chain security posture is low risk.",
