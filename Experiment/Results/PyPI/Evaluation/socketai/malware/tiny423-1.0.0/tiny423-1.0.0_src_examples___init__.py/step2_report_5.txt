  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- No code provided; all fields indicate absence of code.\n- Scores: confidence=0, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Since no code is present, there's nothing to confirm or refute. The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also states no code provided.\n- Scores: confidence=0, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Same reasoning as above; no code means no analysis possible.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Provides a detailed textual analysis of code, suggesting it appears benign with no overt malicious constructs.\n- Scores: confidence=0.4, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Analysis of scores:**\n  - Malware=0 aligns with the conclusion of no malicious activity.\n  - SecurityRisk=0.2 suggests a low but non-zero concern, possibly due to limited context.\n  - Confidence=0.4 reflects moderate uncertainty given the lack of full code visibility.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning appears sound. The low confidence and risk scores are justified given the incomplete context.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- No code content; only mentions absence of code.\n- Scores: all zeros.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate, as no code means no basis for analysis.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, minimal or no code content.\n- Scores: confidence=0.8, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** The high confidence score seems inconsistent given the absence of code; without code, confidence should be lower. Possibly an overestimation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of issues:\n- The only report with substantive analysis (Report 3) has reasonable scores.\n- The other reports correctly assign zero or minimal scores due to lack of code.\n- The confidence score in Report 5 appears inflated given no code is provided.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- For reports with no code, all scores should remain at zero or very low, except perhaps confidence, which should reflect the inability to assess.\n- The malware score should be zero unless explicit malicious behavior is demonstrated.\n- The obfuscated score should be zero unless code is confirmed to be obfuscated, which cannot be determined without code.\n- For Report 5, reduce confidence to a very low value (e.g., 0.1 or 0), as there's no code to analyze.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All should be 0 unless explicit malicious code is identified.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All should be 0 unless code is confirmed obfuscated.\n- **Risk scores:** Only Report 3 has a low but justified risk score; others should remain at 0.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- Malware: 0 across all reports.\n- Obfuscated: 0 across all reports.\n- Risk: Mostly 0, with Report 3 at 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current scores are mostly appropriate, with the exception of Report 5's confidence level, which should be lowered. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present in any report, and the risk remains minimal given the lack of code content.",
