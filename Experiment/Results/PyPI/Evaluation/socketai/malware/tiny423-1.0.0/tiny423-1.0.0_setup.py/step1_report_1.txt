  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with hooks to execute a command during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The function b64d() decodes a base64-encoded string; the call to os.system() executes the decoded command.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executes system-level command derived from decoded base64 string, which can lead to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded by b64d(), then passed directly to os.system() for execution during install process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding followed by execution of decoded string via os.system(), which obfuscates intent and can hide malicious command. The command decoded appears to be an HTTP request.",
  "analysis": "The script defines setup configuration with standard setuptools functions. It includes a function b64d() that decodes base64-encoded data, and a function notmalfunc() that executes a system command decoded from base64. The AfterInstall class runs notmalfunc() during installation, causing execution of the decoded command. The base64 string decodes to a curl command targeting an IP address, potentially for remote data collection or malicious activity. The code's structure indicates it is designed to perform an action during installation without immediate user awareness, utilizing obfuscation via base64. This behavior is suspicious, as it resembles a common tactic to hide malicious commands during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes obfuscated execution of a remote curl command during installation, which indicates malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is highly suspicious due to its obfuscation, execution during package install, and the nature of the decoded command. The package should be considered unsafe to use.",
