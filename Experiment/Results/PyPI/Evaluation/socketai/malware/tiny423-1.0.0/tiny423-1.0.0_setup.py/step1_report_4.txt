{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup script for a Python package, but it includes malicious behavior by executing a system command encoded in base64 during installation.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in the notmalfunc() function, which is decoded and executed during the install command.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executing the decoded string, which initiates an HTTP request to an external server.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded in b64d(), then passed to os.system() in notmalfunc(), triggered during the install process via AfterInstall.run().",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obscure command execution; execution of external URL during package installation; no user input involved but code is designed to run malicious network activity silently.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools for package configuration. It defines a base64 decoding function and an installation hook (AfterInstall) that calls notmalfunc() during installation. notmalfunc() decodes a base64 string, which represents a shell command to perform an HTTP request to a suspicious IP address and port, and executes it via os.system(). The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks with this command. The command execution during package installation is suspicious and indicative of malicious intent, potentially designed to contact a remote server for malicious purposes or to download further payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior designed to run a network request upon package installation, which can be used for malicious command and control or data exfiltration. The use of base64 encoding to obscure the command indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
