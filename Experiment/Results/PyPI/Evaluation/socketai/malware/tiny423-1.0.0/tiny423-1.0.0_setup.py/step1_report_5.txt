  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a potentially malicious payload triggered during installation or development.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string within the notmalfunc() function, which is decoded and executed as a system command.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing the decoded string, which makes an HTTP request to an external server.",
  "flows": "The decoded base64 string from notmalfunc() is passed to os.system, which executes the command, sending data to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to hide the command; execution of system commands during package installation/development; external network connection without transparency.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package with custom install and develop commands. During installation, the notmalfunc() function is invoked, which decodes a base64-encoded string to produce a URL or command. This string is decoded to a URL ('http://192.168.1.3:8000/test.txt | base'), and then executed via os.system, resulting in an HTTP request or similar network activity. This behavior is suspicious, as it connects to an external server during package installation, possibly to exfiltrate data or perform malicious activities. The use of base64 encoding appears designed to obfuscate the command. No other malicious code, such as data theft or backdoors, is evident beyond the external connection. The rest of the setup code appears legitimate and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by executing an external network request during installation, likely for malicious purposes. The code uses obfuscation techniques to hide its intent. The core malicious activity is triggered in the AfterInstall class, making this a high-risk package that should not be used.",
