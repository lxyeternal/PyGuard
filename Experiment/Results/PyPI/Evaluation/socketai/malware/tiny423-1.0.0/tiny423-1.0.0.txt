      "conclusion": "The dependency code shows no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scoring across reports is appropriate, with minimal risk and malware likelihood. The only adjustment needed is to lower the confidence score in Report 5 to better match the absence of code. Overall, the supply chain security posture is low risk."
