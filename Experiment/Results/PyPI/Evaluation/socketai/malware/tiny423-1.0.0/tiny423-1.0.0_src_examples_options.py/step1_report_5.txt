  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the installation and setup of a Python package, potentially including dependencies and configuration routines.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, configuration files, and package metadata. No direct user input or network data appears to be read explicitly.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include subprocess calls, network communication, file writes, or environment variable modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or files into configuration routines, which then may invoke subprocesses or network functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident. Unusual or obfuscated code segments are not present. There is some dynamic import or execution that warrants attention, but appears to be standard package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on package setup, dependency installation, and configuration. No signs of malicious activities such as network exfiltration, reverse shells, or data theft are present. The code adheres to typical patterns seen in setup scripts. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation techniques are observed. The overall structure indicates standard package installation and configuration procedures.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a normal setup script for a Python package, with no malicious activity detected.",
