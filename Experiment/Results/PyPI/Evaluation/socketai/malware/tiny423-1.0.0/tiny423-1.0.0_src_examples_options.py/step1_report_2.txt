  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some data processing or utility functions, but without the actual code, the specific purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions (e.g., input(), sys.stdin, environment variables), file reads, network requests, or user data inputs, but none are explicitly visible without code content.",
  "sinks": "Possible sinks are functions that send data over the network, write to files, execute system commands, or handle sensitive data, but specific functions cannot be identified without code content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through various variables and functions; however, without the code, the exact flow cannot be traced.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without seeing the code; look for hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information is provided to perform a detailed step-by-step analysis. No code content is available for source, sink, flow, or anomaly identification. Therefore, the review cannot definitively identify malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The code appears to be benign or simply not provided for review. Further analysis requires actual code content.",
