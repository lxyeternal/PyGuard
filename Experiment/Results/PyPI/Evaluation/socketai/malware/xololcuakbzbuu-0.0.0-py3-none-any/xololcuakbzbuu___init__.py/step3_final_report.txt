  "purpose": "Decode and execute a base64-encoded payload, likely malicious obfuscated code.",
  "sources": "The base64 string decoded by b.b64decode()",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing the decoded payload",
  "flows": "base64 string -> b64decode() -> exec()",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation via base64 encoding, immediate execution without validation",
  "analysis": "The code imports base64, decodes a large obfuscated string, and executes it directly. This pattern is characteristic of malicious scripts aiming to conceal payloads and execute arbitrary code. The obfuscation level is high, and the use of exec() on decoded data poses a significant security risk. Without analyzing the decoded payload, certainty about malicious intent cannot be absolute, but the pattern strongly indicates malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern is highly suspicious and likely malicious, involving obfuscation and dynamic execution of unknown code. It should be treated as malicious or at least highly suspicious, warranting further static analysis of the payload.",
