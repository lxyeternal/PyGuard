  "purpose": "Decodes and executes base64-encoded Python code, likely for dynamic or obfuscated behavior.",
  "sources": "Base64 string decoded via b64decode, executed with exec().",
  "sinks": "exec() function with decoded code, which can execute arbitrary and potentially malicious code.",
  "flows": "Base64 string -> b64decode -> exec() -> execution of decoded code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and exec() suggests obfuscation; the code is designed to execute dynamically decoded content, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the base64 module as 'b', then decodes a lengthy base64 string and executes the decoded content using exec(). The base64 string likely contains further Python code, which is not visible directly. This pattern is commonly used to hide malicious scripts or obfuscated payloads. No other library or input sources are evident. The use of exec() on decoded data is a strong indicator of malicious or suspicious behavior, as it allows execution of arbitrary code. Without decoding and analyzing the base64 payload, we cannot determine the exact nature of the code, but the pattern itself is risky and typically associated with obfuscation and potential malware.",
  "conclusion": "The script is obfuscated by decoding a base64 string and executing it dynamically, which is a common tactic in malicious code to hide intent. This pattern is suspicious and should be treated as potentially malicious, requiring further analysis of the decoded payload to confirm malicious activity.",
