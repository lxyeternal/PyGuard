  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to clone a specific GitHub repository and move a script to the startup folder for persistence.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), git.Git(repoDirectory).clone(gitUrl), os.listdir(source), os.rename(src_path, dst_path)",
  "sinks": "Cloning external repository into startup folder, renaming and moving scripts into startup folder",
  "flows": "os.getlogin() → cloning repo into startup folder → moving 'test.py' into startup folder",
  "anomalies": "Cloning a repository directly into the startup folder for persistence, moving a script into startup folder, hardcoded GitHub URL, environment modification with GIT_PYTHON_REFRESH",
  "analysis": "The code modifies environment variables, clones a GitHub repository directly into the user's startup folder, and moves a script into that folder. This behavior indicates persistence setup which could be malicious. The direct use of git to clone potentially malicious code into startup is suspicious. The environment variable change appears unnecessary for legitimate setup and may be used to suppress git output. No user input is validated, and the process could execute arbitrary code from the cloned repository. The script does not verify the contents of the cloned code, which could be malicious. Overall, the code appears designed to ensure persistent execution by placing a script in startup, which is typical of malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs actions indicative of malicious persistence techniques by cloning an external repository directly into the startup folder and moving scripts there without validation. The behavior aligns with typical malware activities such as maintaining persistence and executing arbitrary code, warranting high suspicion.",
