{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the installation process to clone a remote GitHub repository into the user's startup folder and moves a specific script file to the startup directory, potentially for persistence or malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.getlogin()), reading files from cloned directory (os.listdir, os.path.join), importing modules (git), and network access via git clone.",
  "sinks": "Creating directories (os.makedirs), renaming files (os.rename), executing code during installation (install.run), and cloning a repository from a remote URL.",
  "flows": "Environment variable os.getlogin() provides user-specific paths; cloned repository from GitHub is stored in startup folder; script file 'test.py' is moved from cloned repo to startup directory, potentially to execute on startup.",
  "anomalies": "Cloning a GitHub repo into startup folder and moving scripts there during package installation is unusual and suspicious; environment variable usage to target user directories; no explicit user consent or transparency. The script modifies startup files without user notification, which is a typical behavior of persistence mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the installation command to include steps that clone a remote repository directly into the Windows startup folder, which can be used to ensure code executes automatically on user login. It then moves a specific script from the cloned repository into the startup directory, likely for persistence. These behaviors are not typical for legitimate packages and resemble mechanisms used in malware for maintaining persistence. There are no signs of obfuscation or encryption; the code uses standard library calls. The use of git to clone into a startup directory is a significant indicator of malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior designed to compromise user environment.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior by manipulating startup items to execute remote code, indicating a high potential for persistence and unauthorized control. The code appears intentionally designed to execute a script from a remote repository on user login, which is characteristic of malware or supply chain sabotage.",
