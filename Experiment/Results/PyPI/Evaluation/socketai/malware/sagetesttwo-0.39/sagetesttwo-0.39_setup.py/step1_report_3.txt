  "purpose": "Custom installation process that clones a GitHub repository into the Windows startup folder and moves a script into the startup directory to execute on system login.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), environment variables, git.Git().clone()",
  "sinks": "Filesystem operations (os.makedirs, os.rename), cloning repo into startup folder",
  "flows": "System login triggers startup folder execution -> code clones malicious repository -> moves potentially malicious script into startup",
  "anomalies": "Cloning a repository directly into the startup folder, moving a script into startup directory, hidden intent to execute code at startup, hardcoded GitHub URL, environment variable manipulation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that sets an environment variable, clones a remote repository into the Windows startup folder, and moves a script ('test.py') into the startup directory. This behavior indicates an intent to run arbitrary code at system startup without user consent. The GitHub repository URL is hardcoded and may contain malicious code. The operations performed can execute malicious scripts automatically upon login, constituting a potential backdoor or persistence mechanism. No legitimate or benign purpose for such aggressive startup modifications is evident. The code's structure and operations strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code clones a remote repository into the Windows startup folder and moves a script into startup, enabling persistent execution of potentially malicious code. These actions are indicative of malicious behavior intended to establish persistence on the compromised system.",
