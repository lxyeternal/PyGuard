{
  "purpose": "The code clones a remote GitHub repository into the Windows startup folder during installation, moves a script into that folder, and sets environment variables, all without user consent, to establish persistence and potentially execute malicious code at login.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.getlogin()), constructs user-specific paths, and clones a Git repository from a specified URL.",
  "sinks": "The cloned repository is moved into the startup folder, and a script ('test.py') is renamed/moved into the startup directory, where it can execute upon user login.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variable and user login info → cloning repository into startup folder → moving 'test.py' into startup folder → script executes at login.",
  "anomalies": "Cloning a remote repository directly into the startup folder, moving scripts into startup without user notification, and performing these actions during package installation without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs suspicious actions: it clones an external repository into the startup folder, moves a script there, and does so during installation without user consent. These behaviors are characteristic of malware persistence mechanisms. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and uses standard libraries. The actions could lead to remote code execution and system compromise. The high malware score (0.9) and security risk (0.9) are justified given the behavior. No logical flaws or false positives are evident; the behavior aligns with malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious persistence tactics by cloning and moving scripts into the startup folder during installation, enabling remote code execution without user consent. The behavior is characteristic of malware, and the scores reflect a high threat level.",
