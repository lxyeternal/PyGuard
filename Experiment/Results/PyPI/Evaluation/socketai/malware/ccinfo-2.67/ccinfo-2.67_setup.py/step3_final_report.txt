  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'ccinfo' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for directory 'tahg'; execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "PowerShell command execution with subprocess.Popen, especially the encoded command run with CREATE_NO_WINDOW.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check ('if not os.path.exists'), then conditionally execute the obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently and hidden; silent try-except blocks suppress errors; conditional execution based on filesystem; obfuscation of payload.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup but includes a suspicious conditional execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command if the directory 'tahg' does not exist. The command is encoded, run with hidden window flags, and errors are suppressed silently, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.75-0.8, obfuscated ~0.85, risk ~0.85) are consistent with this behavior. Decoding the payload could confirm malicious intent, but based on current evidence, the behavior strongly suggests malicious or covert activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup, indicating high suspicion of malicious intent. The scores are justified given the stealthy, conditional, and encoded nature of the payload. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious payloads. Until then, treat this package as potentially malicious.",
