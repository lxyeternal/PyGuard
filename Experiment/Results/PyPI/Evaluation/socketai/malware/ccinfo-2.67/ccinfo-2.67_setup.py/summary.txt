  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup, indicating high suspicion of malicious intent. The scores are justified given the stealthy, conditional, and encoded nature of the payload. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious payloads. Until then, treat this package as potentially malicious."
