  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion for malicious activity due to obfuscation, commented payloads, and hardcoded secrets. Although active functions appear benign, the embedded indicators warrant treating this dependency as potentially malicious. It should undergo thorough dynamic analysis and deobfuscation before deployment, and the hardcoded secrets should be secured or removed."
