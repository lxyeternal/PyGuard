  "malware_score": 0.85,
  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-confidence malicious activity through obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup, consistent with supply chain attack tactics. The scores reflect high suspicion and risk, and further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
