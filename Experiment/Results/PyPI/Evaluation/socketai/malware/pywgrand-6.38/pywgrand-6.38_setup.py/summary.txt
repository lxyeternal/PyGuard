  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command during setup. The red flags include obfuscation, concealment, and suppression of errors. Scores are aligned with these findings, but increasing the malware score to around 0.8 and the risk score similarly is recommended to better reflect the potential threat. Decoding the payload is necessary for definitive confirmation, but current evidence warrants treating this package as malicious until further analysis is performed."
