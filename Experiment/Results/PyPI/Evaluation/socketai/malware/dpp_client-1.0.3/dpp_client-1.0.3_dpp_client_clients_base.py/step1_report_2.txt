  "purpose": "Define an abstract client class for sending events with validation and logging",
  "sources": "Input parameters: event_type, event_data, timestamp, timeout, logger",
  "sinks": "Logging statements, method calls",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through validation and logging, then to the abstract _send_event method",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Use of six for compatibility is standard. Logging is typical. No malicious code or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class for sending events, with validation for event_type and timestamp, and logging for debugging. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are directly used in a malicious manner. The code does not include any network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. Use of six for compatibility is common. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured abstract class for event handling with validation and logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
