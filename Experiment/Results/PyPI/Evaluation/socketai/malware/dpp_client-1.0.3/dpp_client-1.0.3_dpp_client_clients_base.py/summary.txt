  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured abstract class with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal (around 0.1-0.2), mainly due to potential data leakage via logs. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The overall assessment is that the code is safe and suitable for use, with standard precautions regarding logging sensitive data."
