  "purpose": "Covertly collects system information (pwd, user, hostname) and exfiltrates it to an external server during package import, indicating malicious data theft.",

    "Data exfiltration occurs during module import without user consent or validation",
    "Use of os.popen() for sensitive info collection",
    "Transmission to suspicious external URL",
    "No error handling or encryption"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code executes system commands to gather sensitive environment info and immediately transmits this data to an external server during import, which is indicative of malicious activity. The commands used are standard but are exploited here for covert data theft. The URL domain is suspicious and unrelated to package hosting. The behavior aligns with malicious exfiltration tactics, with no validation or user notification. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and performs actions that compromise privacy and security. The exfiltration occurs silently, with no safeguards, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior through covert data collection and exfiltration during package import. It poses a high security risk, with clear signs of malicious intent. The malware score should be set to 1, and the security risk score should also be at maximum, reflecting the severity of the privacy invasion and potential exploitation.",
