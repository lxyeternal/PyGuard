  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, file I/O, function parameters, network interactions, system commands.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, system commands, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs), including environment variables, files, network.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code snippets.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code or benign code with standard data handling. Scores of malware at 0 and obfuscated at 0 are appropriate. Security risk scores of 0.2 reflect minimal concern, justified by the benign nature of the code summaries. Confidence levels of 0.8 are consistent with cautious but reasonable assessments given the lack of detailed code. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are observed across reports. The reasoning aligns with the scores assigned, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The overall evaluation indicates no malicious activity or obfuscation in the analyzed dependencies. The low security risk scores are appropriate, and the malware scores correctly reflect the absence of malicious behavior. The reports are consistent and justified based on the provided summaries.",
