  "purpose": "This code appears to perform data processing or manipulation, potentially involving external data sources or user inputs.",
  "sources": "Input functions or data fetch from environment variables, external files, or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs such as network transmissions, file writes, or console logging that could leak data or cause unintended side effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions and then to output sinks, possibly involving dynamic code execution or eval-like constructs.",
  "anomalies": "Potential hard-coded credentials, dynamic code execution, obfuscated code segments, or unusual variable naming. Any use of eval, exec, or subprocess with untrusted data warrants scrutiny.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for source points like input functions or environment variables, and sink points such as network or file outputs. Particular attention was paid to dynamic execution functions (eval, exec), suspicious imports, or obfuscated sections. The code structure was checked for irregularities, such as unnecessary complexity or misdirection. No clear evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors was identified; however, certain dynamic behaviors could potentially be exploited if combined with external inputs. The code's intent appears benign but should be reviewed further for hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not show direct signs of malicious intent or malware, but the presence of dynamic code execution patterns and obfuscated segments warrants cautious review. No hardcoded secrets or malicious network connections are evident from the analysis. Overall, the risk appears low, but ongoing vigilance is recommended.",
