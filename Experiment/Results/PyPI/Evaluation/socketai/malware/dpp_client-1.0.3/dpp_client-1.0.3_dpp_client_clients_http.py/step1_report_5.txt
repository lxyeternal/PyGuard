  "purpose": "A client class for sending events to a specified endpoint via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "endpoint parameter, timestamp, event_data, event_type, timeout, logger",
  "sinks": "requests.Session().post() method sending JSON data to an endpoint, untrusted endpoint URL, unvalidated event data",
  "flows": "endpoint, event_type, timestamp, event_data -> _send_event() -> session.post() to endpoint",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious data handling, standard use of requests library, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class that prepares event data and sends it via HTTP POST request. The endpoint URL is provided at instantiation, which could be untrusted but is expected to be set intentionally. The code does not perform any dangerous operations such as executing received data, connecting to suspicious domains, or leaking system information. It uses the 'requests' library securely with session management and proper error handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident. The code appears straightforward and aligns with typical API client design. The potential risk depends on whether the endpoint URL is malicious or untrusted, but the code itself does not include malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an HTTP client for event reporting, with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious activity. Its security risk is low, provided the endpoint is trusted. No obfuscation or malware indicators are present.",
