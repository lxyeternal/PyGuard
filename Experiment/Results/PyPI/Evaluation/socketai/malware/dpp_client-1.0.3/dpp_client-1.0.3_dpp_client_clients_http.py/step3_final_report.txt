  "purpose": "A straightforward HTTP client class for sending event data via POST requests to a specified endpoint, primarily used for telemetry or logging.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: endpoint URL, event data, timestamp, and configuration options; external inputs for endpoint and event data.",
  "sinks": "The POST request to the endpoint with JSON data containing timestamp, event type, and event data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → _send_event method constructs data → session.post sends data to endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The code is clear and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class managing an HTTP session, formatting timestamps, and sending event data via POST. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The only external concern is the untrusted endpoint URL, which is a configuration issue, not a code flaw. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard event reporting client with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk scores are appropriate, and the malware score remains at 0. External endpoint trustworthiness is the main concern outside the code scope.",
