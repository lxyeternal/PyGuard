  "purpose": "Define a client for sending event data to a specified endpoint via HTTP POST requests.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: endpoint URL, event_type, timestamp, event_data, timeout, logger, adapter_kwargs.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to the endpoint; uses untrusted data in the request payload.",
  "flows": "Timestamp and event data are formatted and included in JSON payload, then sent via session.post() to the endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or unusual code behaviors observed. The code appears to be standard HTTP client code.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an HTTP session, formats timestamps, and sends event data as JSON payloads to a specified endpoint. It does not include any suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or hidden functionalities. The only external interaction is via requests.Session() and a POST request with provided data. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and appears intended for legitimate event reporting.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a client to send event data to a server endpoint. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The security risk is low, with no signs of compromise or malicious intent.",
