{
  "purpose": "The code appears benign, performing standard data processing or network communication with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user input, external modules, or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Print statements, file operations, network connections, or external data transmissions.",
  "flows": "Input sources to output sinks through data processing functions without suspicious transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs observed; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is either missing or limited in content, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. Confidence is high (0.9) in benign assessment due to lack of suspicious features. No source-to-sink anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The scores (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2) are consistent with the benign and limited nature of the code. Given the absence of evidence, the overall security posture appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscating features detected. The low risk score reflects minimal security concern. All assessments are consistent with the available information.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
