  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated due to lack of comments or documentation. It appears to perform some form of data processing or network communication, but without further context, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, files, or network sources (if present). Specific source points are not explicitly identifiable from the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data transmission points, especially if untrusted data is involved. These points are not explicitly identified without more context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or external inputs to sinks like network calls or file operations, but exact source-to-sink paths cannot be determined from the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious variable names are observed in the given code snippet. There are no signs of malicious payloads or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with typical imports and function definitions. It does not include obfuscated constructs, unusual language features, or suspicious patterns. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. Due to limited visibility of the full code, some assumptions are made, but nothing explicitly suspicious is detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, with no evident malware or malicious intent. However, the lack of detailed context limits the confidence in this assessment.",
