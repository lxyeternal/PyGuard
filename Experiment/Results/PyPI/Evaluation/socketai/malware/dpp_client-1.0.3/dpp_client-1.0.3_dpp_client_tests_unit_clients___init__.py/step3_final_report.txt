  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, dynamic execution points, import statements, variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, dynamic code execution, network connections, file operations.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into dynamic execution or data handling functions, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic code execution (`exec`, `eval`), obfuscated variable names, reading environment variables, inconsistent code patterns, suspicious control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets in reports 1-4 are mostly empty or straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity, aligning with their low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5 exhibits dynamic code execution, obfuscated variables, and environment variable reads, which are red flags for malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0.4, obfuscated=0.7, securityRisk=0.5) are justified given these patterns. Overall, the scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with benign code scoring zero and report 5 appropriately elevated due to suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with no malicious indicators, reflected in low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5 shows suspicious patterns justifying moderate scores. The overall malware score across all reports should be around 0.2, with obfuscation near 0.3 and risk around 0.25, indicating low but cautious concern due to the suspicious patterns in report 5.",
