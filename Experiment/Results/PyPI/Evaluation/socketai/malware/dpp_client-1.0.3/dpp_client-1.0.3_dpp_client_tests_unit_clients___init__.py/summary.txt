  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with no malicious indicators, reflected in low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5 shows suspicious patterns justifying moderate scores. The overall malware score across all reports should be around 0.2, with obfuscation near 0.3 and risk around 0.25, indicating low but cautious concern due to the suspicious patterns in report 5."
