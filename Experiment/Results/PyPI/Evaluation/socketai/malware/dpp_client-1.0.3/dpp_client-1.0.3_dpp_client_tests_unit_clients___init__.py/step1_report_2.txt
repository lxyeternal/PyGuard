{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from user input, environment variables, or file I/O; potentially fetches external data via network calls.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, prints to console, or sends data over network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (user input, environment, files) to processing functions, possibly culminating in network transmission or file output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed; no obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic execution detected; code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input and environment data, processes it through functions, and possibly outputs results or communicates externally. No suspicious network addresses or backdoors identified. Usage of standard libraries and typical programming constructs suggests normal operation. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior observed. The code does not demonstrate unusual obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. The code appears to be legitimate and safe, with a low malware score.",
