  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval/exec, dynamic imports, network calls, hardcoded secrets, input/output data handling.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, environment variables, file operations, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec or network data flow into potential malicious actions or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, use of eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution in some reports, notably reports 2 and 5, which justify higher malware and obfuscation scores. Benign reports (1, 3, 4) show no suspicious patterns. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors. Report 5's high obfuscation and dynamic code strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting high scores. Reports 2's moderate suspicion aligns with their scores. Overall, the scores reflect the evidence, with some room for slight adjustment to better match suspicion levels.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign with low scores, except report 5 which indicates high suspicion of malicious activity. The scores are generally consistent with the behaviors described. Further detailed code analysis is recommended for reports showing obfuscation and dynamic execution.",
