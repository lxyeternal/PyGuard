{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package named 'selfhttpmc' with a dependency on 'modlib'. It also contains hidden commands potentially for malicious activity, likely related to code obfuscation or backdoor functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file system (os.path.exists), and executes a subprocess command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executes a PowerShell command which could be used for malicious purposes such as downloading or executing remote code, or establishing hidden connections.",
  "flows": "The script checks for a specific directory ('tahg'), and if absent, executes a hidden PowerShell command. The setup function then proceeds to install the package configuration, which appears benign but is potentially part of the malicious flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated PowerShell command via encoded string, executing without user awareness. No visible hardcoded credentials, but the obfuscation suggests malicious intent. The presence of a suspicious domain ('esquelesquad.rip') in a comment and encoded command indicates malicious or backdoor activity.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing setup from distutils and attempts to import subprocess and os modules. It checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists; if not, it executes a PowerShell command encoded in base64, hidden from plain sight, likely for malicious purposes such as establishing a backdoor or downloading malware. The setup function is then called to package a library, which could be a cover for malicious activity. The use of obfuscated commands and hidden execution flows indicates malicious intent. The code's overall structure and the embedded encoded command strongly suggest it is designed to execute malicious operations secretly.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains suspicious obfuscated PowerShell code intended for hidden execution, likely malicious, possibly establishing a backdoor or downloading additional malicious payloads. The setup part may serve as a cover. Overall, high risk of malicious behavior.",
