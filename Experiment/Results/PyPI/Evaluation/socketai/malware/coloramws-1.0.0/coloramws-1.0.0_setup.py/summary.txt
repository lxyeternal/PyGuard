  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk malicious behavior through encrypted payload decryption and execution during installation, especially on Windows. The pattern of obfuscation and dynamic code execution strongly suggests malicious intent. The provided reports' scores are appropriate and justified. It is recommended to treat this package as malicious or highly suspicious until further decrypted payload analysis confirms safety."
