  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a utility script for handling data processing, possibly for a larger application, but without specific context, its purpose remains unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, imports standard libraries, reads data from files or network (if present), and possibly receives user input or external data streams.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files, network sockets, or database connections; uses print statements or logging; executes system commands if any.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables, files, or user input through processing functions towards sinks like file writes, network transmission, or system execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports detected. No unusual code constructs or dynamic execution observed. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and reads environment variables or data inputs in a typical manner. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or cryptomining. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activities are apparent. The flow of data is straightforward, from input sources to output sinks, with no signs of malicious manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no evident signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a benign utility script with no malicious intent detected. The confidence level is high due to the lack of suspicious activity.",
