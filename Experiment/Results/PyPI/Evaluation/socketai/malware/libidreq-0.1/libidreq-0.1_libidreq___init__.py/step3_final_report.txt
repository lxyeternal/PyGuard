  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, network interactions, file I/O, user inputs",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file modification, environment variable access, system commands",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via data processing functions, dynamic execution, or network calls",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, dynamic execution, unusual variable naming",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns, malicious activity, or obfuscation. Malware scores are consistently 0, reflecting no malicious intent. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), indicating minimal concern. Confidence levels are high where analysis is performed, and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified. The assessments are aligned with the descriptions, and no evidence suggests malicious or obfuscated code. Static analysis supports the conclusion of benignity, and the scoring is appropriate given the information.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed are benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary; the overall security posture is low risk.",
