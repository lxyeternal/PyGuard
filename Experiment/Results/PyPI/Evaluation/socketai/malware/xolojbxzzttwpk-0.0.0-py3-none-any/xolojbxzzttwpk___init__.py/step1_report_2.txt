  "purpose": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string and executes the resulting code.",
  "sources": "The source is the base64-encoded string passed to base64.b64decode.",
  "sinks": "The sink is the exec() function, which executes the decoded code without sanitization.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the base64 string to decoding, then directly into execution via exec().",
  "anomalies": "The code immediately executes a large, obfuscated payload decoded from base64, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the base64 module as 'b', then decodes a long base64 string. The decoded string is then executed with exec(). This pattern indicates obfuscation and potential malicious intent, as executing arbitrary decoded code without validation is a common tactic to hide malicious payloads. The base64 string is large and complex, further suggesting obfuscation. Since the code has no other context or validation, it likely aims to run malicious code embedded in the base64 payload.",
  "conclusion": "The script decodes and executes an obfuscated payload, which is highly suspicious. The immediate execution of decoded code without any validation or sanitization strongly indicates malicious intent, such as loading malware or backdoors.",
