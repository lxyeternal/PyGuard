  "purpose": "Decodes a base64-encoded string and executes the resulting code, likely for dynamic code execution or payload delivery.",
  "sources": "Reads the base64 string from the hardcoded string literal in the import and exec statement.",
  "sinks": "exec function with decoded data, leading to potential execution of malicious code.",
  "flows": "Base64 decode from the hardcoded string → execute the decoded code via exec.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding combined with exec to run obfuscated code; the code is heavily encoded and likely maliciously intended to hide its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the base64 library as 'b' and immediately decodes a large base64 string, then executes it with exec(). The decoding process reveals that the string is a large base64-encoded payload. Such obfuscation is a common tactic in malicious scripts to hide payloads or payload behaviors. The code’s purpose appears to be to run potentially malicious code dynamically loaded from the encoded string, which could perform harmful actions such as system modification, data exfiltration, or establishing backdoors. The heavy use of encoding and immediate execution strongly suggests malicious intent, as it aims to hide the true payload from static analysis. The final line of the decoded code is a comment indicating it is to 'print an error in source script,' but the core behavior remains the dynamic decoding and execution of obfuscated code, a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This script is designed for obfuscated, dynamic code execution through base64 decoding and exec. It is highly suspicious and likely malicious, aimed at hiding harmful payloads. The decoding and execution pattern, combined with heavy obfuscation, points to malicious intent and security risk.",
