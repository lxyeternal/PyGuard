{
  "purpose": "Download and execute a remote binary, and install a Python package configuration.",
  "sources": "requests.get to fetch remote content; open() calls to write files; system() call to execute a binary",
  "sinks": "system() execution of the downloaded 'node' binary; writing potentially malicious configuration file",
  "flows": "requests.get fetches remote binary → writes to /tmp/node → executes /tmp/node with parameters",
  "anomalies": "Fetching a binary from a suspicious URL and executing it; creation of configuration with IP address and execution of binary without verification",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'requests' and downloads a file from a hardcoded URL, saving it as '/tmp/node', then sets executable permissions and runs it with specific parameters. The configuration file contains IP address and port that could be malicious. The code then proceeds to set up a Python package via setuptools, which appears benign. The main concern is the unverified download and execution of remote code, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent or backdoor installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code downloads and executes a remote binary from an untrusted source, which is highly suspicious and likely malicious. The setup of the Python package appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the malicious behavior. Overall, this code exhibits high malicious potential.",
