      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code without validation, writing suspicious configuration data, and executing potentially harmful binaries. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the package should be considered malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; the malware score should be at least 0.9, and the risk score similarly high. The code should be flagged and removed from any supply chain."
