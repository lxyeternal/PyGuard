  "conclusion": "The script exhibits high obfuscation and performs system modifications, package installations, and file operations under specific conditions, indicating malicious or sabotage intent. The high scores for malware (~0.9), obfuscation (~0.9), and security risk (~0.9) are justified. It should be considered malicious, and its deployment avoided. Further dynamic and static analysis in a secure environment is recommended before any use."
