{
  "purpose": "The script gathers system information such as uptime, OS details, and IP address, then sends this data to a remote server upon installation of the package.",
  "sources": "Reads /proc/uptime, platform information, socket.gethostname(), and socket.gethostbyname() to gather system details.",
  "sinks": "socket.connect() and socket.send() are used to transmit data to an external server at 134.209.85.64:80.",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources flows directly into a string which is then sent over the network via socket connection to the specified IP address.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes automatic sending of system info to an external IP during package installation, which is not typical behavior for a benign package. The IP address is hardcoded and the code runs during installation, potentially without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system uptime, OS details, and IP address, then immediately opens a socket connection to a specific external IP and transmits this information. This occurs during the package installation process, embedded within a custom install command. The data transmission could be used for tracking or reconnaissance without user knowledge. No other malicious activity or backdoors are detected. The code appears to perform system information leakage to an external entity, which is suspicious in the context of supply chain security.",
  "conclusion": "The package exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to a remote server during installation. This behavior is a security concern and indicates potential malicious intent, such as tracking or reconnaissance, which is inappropriate for a benign package.",
