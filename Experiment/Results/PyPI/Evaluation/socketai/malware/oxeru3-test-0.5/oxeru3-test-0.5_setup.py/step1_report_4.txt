{
  "purpose": "The script collects system information and uptime, then transmits this data to a remote server upon package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads /proc/uptime for system uptime; gathers system info via platform module; resolves hostname for IP; reads environment variables indirectly through socket and platform; initiates network connection to remote server at 134.209.85.64.",
  "sinks": "Creates a socket connection to 134.209.85.64:80 and sends system info data; potentially leaks system details to remote server.",
  "flows": "Collects system info (source) -> formats data -> opens socket connection -> sends data (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional network connection during package installation without user consent; hardcoded remote IP address; no user input validation or obfuscation; no clear legitimate reason for sending system info; no encryption or data privacy measures.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to execute upon installation of the package. It gathers system uptime and detailed OS information, then transmits this data to a specified remote IP address. The remote IP is hardcoded, and the connection is initiated automatically during installation, which could be used for reconnaissance or data exfiltration. There are no obfuscation techniques, and the code functions straightforwardly. The purpose appears suspicious as it automatically leaks system details without user knowledge or consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. Overall, the behavior indicates potential malicious intent or at least malicious side effects, given the unsolicited transmission of system info.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior by collecting and transmitting system information to an external server during installation, without user consent. The hardcoded IP and automatic data transmission are suspicious. This package should be treated with caution and considered potentially malicious.",
