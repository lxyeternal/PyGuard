  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly collecting and exfiltrating system information during package installation. The hardcoded IP and unencrypted data transfer reinforce its suspicious nature. The high malware and security risk scores are justified, and the package should be flagged for review or removal due to its potential privacy violations and malicious intent."
