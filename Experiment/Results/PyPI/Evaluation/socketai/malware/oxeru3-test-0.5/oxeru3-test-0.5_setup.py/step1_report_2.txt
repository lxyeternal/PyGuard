{
  "purpose": "The code gathers system information such as uptime, OS details, and IP address, then sends this data to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading /proc/uptime, importing platform and socket modules, executing socket connection in createfile()",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to 134.209.85.64:80, sending data over network",
  "flows": "createfile() reads system info -> connects to remote IP -> sends collected data",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits system details to a remote IP during installation without user consent, which is suspicious. The hardcoded IP address and the act of sending system info during package install are unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function createfile() that collects system uptime, OS details, and IP address, then sends this information to an external IP address via socket. This is invoked during the post-installation process of a package, which is unusual behavior for benign setup scripts. The remote server address is hardcoded, and data is sent unencrypted. The code does not appear to perform malicious actions like system modification, but it does collect and transmit system information stealthily, which can be used for surveillance or malicious data gathering.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains potentially malicious behavior by collecting and exfiltrating system information during installation without user awareness. It may be used for tracking or reconnaissance. The code does not perform obvious destructive actions but exhibits suspicious data transmission behavior.",
