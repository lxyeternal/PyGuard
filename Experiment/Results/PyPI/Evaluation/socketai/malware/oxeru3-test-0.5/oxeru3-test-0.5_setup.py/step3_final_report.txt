  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward collection of system data and transmits it silently to an external server during package installation. It uses standard modules and functions with no obfuscation or encryption. The data exfiltration occurs automatically, indicating malicious or surveillance intent. The behavior is consistent with covert data collection malware, with high potential for privacy invasion. The scores assigned in the reports reflect this, with high malware (0.75-0.8) and security risk (0.75-0.8) scores justified by the stealthy exfiltration activity. No code obfuscation is present, and the overall behavior is suspicious but not destructive.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly collecting and exfiltrating system information during package installation. The hardcoded IP and unencrypted data transfer reinforce its suspicious nature. The high malware and security risk scores are justified, and the package should be flagged for review or removal due to its potential privacy violations and malicious intent.",
