{
  "purpose": "The code collects system uptime, system information, and IP details, then sends this data to a specific IP address over a network socket upon package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads /proc/uptime for system uptime, platform module for system info, socket.gethostname() for IP, and socket connection to send data.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection to IP 134.209.85.64 on port 80 where the collected data is sent.",
  "flows": "System info and uptime are gathered -> formatted into a string -> transmitted via socket connection to external IP.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded external IP address for data exfiltration during post-installation. No user input or dynamic IP handling. Data is sent immediately upon package install without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves system uptime from /proc/uptime and gathers OS details using platform. It constructs a string containing this info and the IP address of the host. During the package installation process, it establishes a socket connection to a hardcoded IP (134.209.85.64) on port 80 and transmits the data. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or potentially malicious surveillance. The code does not implement any user prompts, encryption, or other obfuscation, and the IP address appears to be fixed, which indicates malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior. The use of post-install hooks to silently send data without user awareness is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The script secretly collects system information and exfiltrates it to a remote server during package installation. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at privacy invasion or data theft, especially given the hardcoded external IP and lack of user notification.",
