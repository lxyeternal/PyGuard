{
  "purpose": "The code gathers system information such as uptime, OS details, and IP address, and sends this data to a remote server after installation.",
  "sources": "Reading /proc/uptime, platform module for system info, socket.gethostbyname for IP, network connection to 134.209.85.64:80",
  "sinks": "Socket connection sending data over the network to a remote IP address",
  "flows": "System info collected from /proc/uptime, platform, and socket methods flows into a formatted string which is sent via socket to 134.209.85.64:80",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of sending system info to an external server during package installation; hardcoded IP address and port; no user consent or clear purpose stated",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'createfile' that collects system uptime, OS info, and IP address, then sends this data over a socket connection to a hardcoded IP address. This function is invoked during package installation via a custom setup command. No user prompts or permissions are involved. The data collection and transmission appear covert, potentially for malicious surveillance or data exfiltration, especially considering the hardcoded external IP and lack of transparency. No suspicious library or obfuscation detected; behavior is unusual for typical package installation scripts, indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized data collection and exfiltration during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It could be used for system reconnaissance or surveillance without user consent.",
