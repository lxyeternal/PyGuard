  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate benign code with appropriate low scores for malware and obfuscation. Report 5 exhibits suspicious patterns like eval() and obfuscation, suggesting moderate risk. Increasing malware score in report 5 to 0.6 would better reflect the suspicious features. Overall, the supply chain security posture remains low to moderate, with no confirmed malicious payloads. The current scoring is justified, but further code review is recommended for definitive assessment."
