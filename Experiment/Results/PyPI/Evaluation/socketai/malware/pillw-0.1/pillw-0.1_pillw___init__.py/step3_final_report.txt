  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variable reads, module imports, dynamic code execution functions (eval/exec), data flows from inputs to outputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, dynamic code execution, network connections, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or user inputs to sinks like eval(), network calls, or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec(), obfuscation patterns, complex control flow, dynamic string manipulations, inconsistent formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code shows typical patterns of benign data processing with no suspicious activity in reports 1-4. Report 5 indicates suspicious features such as eval() and obfuscation, which could be malicious but lack confirmed payloads. The malware score in report 5 should be increased from 0.2 to reflect the presence of dynamic code features. Obfuscation score remains justified at 0.4, and security risk at 0.4 due to potential malicious patterns. The other reports are consistent with benign behavior, with scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and low security risk. Overall, the scores align with the evidence, but report 5 warrants a higher malware score if suspicious functions are confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate benign code with appropriate low scores for malware and obfuscation. Report 5 exhibits suspicious patterns like eval() and obfuscation, suggesting moderate risk. Increasing malware score in report 5 to 0.6 would better reflect the suspicious features. Overall, the supply chain security posture remains low to moderate, with no confirmed malicious payloads. The current scoring is justified, but further code review is recommended for definitive assessment.",
