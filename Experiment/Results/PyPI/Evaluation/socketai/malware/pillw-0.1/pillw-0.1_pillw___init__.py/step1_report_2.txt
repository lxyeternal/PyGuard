{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context or comments, its primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and potentially external files or data sources, depending on the actual implementation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of dynamically generated code, but specific sinks are not clearly identified due to lack of concrete code snippets.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions to sinks like network calls or file operations, passing through intermediate processing steps. Exact paths are unclear without detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, or obfuscated code are evident. The code structure appears straightforward, but lack of comments limits clarity.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for security issues, obfuscation, and malicious patterns. No suspicious or malicious constructs, such as dynamic code execution, network exfiltration, or backdoors, were identified. The use of third-party libraries appears standard. No signs of data leakage, insecure practices, or malicious behavior are present based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code seems benign, with no suspicious behaviors or malware indicators.",
