  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a certain function within a Python package, but specific details are not provided due to the absence of code content.",
  "sources": "Code reads input or data from environment variables, user inputs, or external files (if present). Without explicit code, this cannot be confirmed.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of system commands if present. No specific sinks identified without code.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from sources to sinks if present could lead to vulnerabilities. No explicit flow observed due to lack of code content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are identifiable without the code.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of code, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. No sources, sinks, or flows are observable, and no anomalies are apparent. The lack of code prevents identification of malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "No code provided for review. Therefore, no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies can be identified. Insufficient data to determine security posture.",
