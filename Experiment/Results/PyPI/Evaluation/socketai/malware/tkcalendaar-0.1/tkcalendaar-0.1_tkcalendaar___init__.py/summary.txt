  "conclusion": "The code shows no concrete malicious activity but contains potential risks associated with dynamic code execution functions. Scores are appropriately cautious, with low malware likelihood but some security concern due to possible unsafe functions. Overall, the dependency appears benign but warrants monitoring if code behavior changes."
