      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and exhibits signs of malicious obfuscation, system manipulation, and covert package installation. Its complex control flow and system API interactions indicate a high likelihood of malicious intent, warranting classification as malicious or compromised. The overall security risk is extremely high, and it should be treated as a threat to system integrity and supply chain security."

      "conclusion": "The code shows no concrete malicious activity but contains potential risks associated with dynamic code execution functions. Scores are appropriately cautious, with low malware likelihood but some security concern due to possible unsafe functions. Overall, the dependency appears benign but warrants monitoring if code behavior changes."
