  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors typical of malicious or backdoor activity, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command in the background during package setup. The pattern of obfuscation, silent execution, and error suppression strongly suggests malicious intent, although the actual payload remains unknown without decoding the command. The high malware and risk scores are justified based on these indicators."
