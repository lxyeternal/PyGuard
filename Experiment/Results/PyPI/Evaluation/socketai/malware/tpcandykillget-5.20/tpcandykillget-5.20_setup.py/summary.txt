  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high obfuscation and malicious activity indicators, notably the execution of an encoded PowerShell payload with stealth tactics. While the setup code appears benign, the payload execution warrants suspicion of malicious intent, justifying high malware and risk scores. Immediate further analysis of the payload is recommended."
