      "conclusion": "The code contains high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The behavior aligns with typical malware tactics, warranting caution. The package's legitimate appearance is overshadowed by embedded suspicious behavior, and further decoding of the command is recommended to confirm malicious payloads."
