      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, which is indicative of malicious activity such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The setup code itself appears legitimate, but the embedded payload and its obfuscation warrant high suspicion. The assigned scores are appropriate, and further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
