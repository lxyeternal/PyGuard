  "purpose": "Decode and execute a base64-encoded string, likely to run obfuscated code.",
  "sources": "Base64 string assigned to variable 'b', then decoded and executed via exec(b.b64decode(...)).",
  "sinks": "exec() function with decoded content, which executes arbitrary code after decoding from base64.",
  "flows": "Base64 string (source) -> b64decode() -> decoded code (potentially malicious) -> exec() -> code execution (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and immediate execution via exec() of decoded data, indicating obfuscation. The base64 string is extremely long and complex, suggesting intentional concealment. No other explicit I/O or network activity is visible.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'base64' module aliased as 'b'. It then decodes a large, complex base64 string and executes the result immediately using exec(). The base64 payload likely contains malicious code, as the pattern of decoding and executing obscurely is common in malicious scripts aiming to hide their true intent. The code does not contain visible input sources or data handling, but the execution of the decoded payload is a significant risk. There is no further context or code beyond this obfuscation, making this highly suspicious and likely malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to obscure malicious intent through decoding and executing a large base64 payload. Such behavior is typical of obfuscated malware or backdoors, as it hides the real code from straightforward static analysis. The immediate execution of decoded data without validation is dangerous. Overall, this script poses a high security risk.",
