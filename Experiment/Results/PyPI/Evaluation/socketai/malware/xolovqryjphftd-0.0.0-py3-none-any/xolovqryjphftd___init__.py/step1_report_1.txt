  "purpose": "Decode and execute a base64-encoded string that likely contains obfuscated Python code.",
  "sources": "Base64 string assigned to variable b, executed via exec() after decoding.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decoded code; potential for executing malicious payload.",
  "flows": "base64.b64decode() decodes data from the source, then exec() executes it directly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding combined with exec() suggests obfuscation. The decoded data is a large, complex string with many encoded characters, indicative of hiding malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the base64 module, then decodes a lengthy base64 string, and executes the resulting code via exec(). The string appears highly obfuscated, with many unusual characters and nested encoded segments. The pattern of encoding and immediate execution is common in malicious scripts aiming to hide their true behavior. Since the decoded string is not human-readable and is intended to be run directly, it raises suspicion. No external inputs or network activity is visible, but the obfuscation strongly suggests an attempt to conceal malicious actions. This could include data exfiltration, system manipulation, or other malicious activities once executed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its obfuscation and use of decode-and-execute pattern. It likely contains malicious payloads or backdoors. Without decoding the string fully, the behavior strongly suggests malicious intent. Caution is advised, and the package should not be trusted without further analysis.",
