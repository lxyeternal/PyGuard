  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; class definitions for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data; exception classes do not process data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as these are solely exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance for exceptions, no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exception types, specifically related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy issues. These classes are simple and only serve as exception types; there are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The code appears to be part of a larger proxy handling module, providing structured error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only standard exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is benign and purely structural for error management.",
