  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n- The code is static, with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or network activity.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n\n**2. Logical flaws, errors, or mistakes in the report:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify that the code is purely definitional and safe.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign scores of `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- Since all reports confirm the code is benign, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- The code only defines exception classes; no malicious behavior is present.\n- Malware score should be 0, as confirmed.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they explicitly state the code is harmless.\n- No assumptions need to be challenged here.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report:**\n- The scores are consistent with the findings.\n- No discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**a. Malware score:** 0  \n**b. Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**c. Risk score:** 0\n\n**d. Additional notes:**\n- The code is standard Python exception class definitions.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and serves as part of an error handling framework. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- No further action needed.",
