{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, no output, and no external calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as the code solely consists of class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or unusual code constructs; the code is straightforward and purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes to handle various SOCKS proxy and authentication errors. All classes inherit from standard exception types and do not contain methods, logic, or data handling. No external input, network operations, or data processing is present. The structure is simple, and the code appears to serve as a part of a larger exception handling framework within a SOCKS proxy implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, establishing exception classes for error handling in SOCKS proxy operations. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The code’s purpose is to facilitate error handling and improve code clarity in a larger project. No security concerns are evident.",
