  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and related connection issues.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reads; only class definitions and exception declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs; purely exception class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow from sources to sinks; just class inheritance structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of exception class declarations to handle various SOCKS proxy error conditions. No external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors are involved. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation. The classes inherit from standard Python exceptions and serve as error indicators within a larger system. No security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security issues. The code appears to be standard and safe.",
