{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy and related connection errors",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; exception class definitions are static",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks present; no potential data effect points",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing beyond class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively contains class definitions for exception handling, inheriting from standard Python exception classes. There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output operations, or network activities. All classes are simple, with no methods or attributes that could perform malicious actions. This appears to be a straightforward setup of custom exception types for SOCKS proxy error handling, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, establishing custom exception classes for use elsewhere. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks within these definitions.",
