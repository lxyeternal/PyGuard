  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n   - No data input/output, network activity, or logic is present.\n   - The classes inherit from standard Python exceptions and do not contain methods or attributes that could be malicious or insecure.\n   - **Conclusion:** The reported issues are *not* present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is straightforward, static, and contains no malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that these are simple exception class definitions with no suspicious constructs.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is justified.\n   - **Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely definitional with no dynamic or network activity, there is no basis for higher risk scores.\n   - The reports' zero scores for malware and security risk are justified.\n   \n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code shows no signs of malicious intent, code injection, or hidden behavior.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately state that the code is benign and purely structural.\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities are made beyond the scope of exception class definitions.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Own Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The scoring aligns well with the analysis. No changes are necessary.",
