  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n   - There are no data sources, external inputs, network operations, or data processing present.\n   - The classes inherit from standard Python exceptions and contain no methods or attributes, serving purely as error indicators.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is found.\n   - The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The purpose is clearly to facilitate error handling within a larger proxy system.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is consistent with the code content and analysis. No malicious activity is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly reflecting the straightforward, non-obfuscated nature of the code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores?**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n   - No report assigns a higher risk score or malware score without justification.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified given the code's simplicity and the thorough reasoning.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly assume no malicious intent or hidden logic.\n   - They do not speculate beyond the observable code, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is purely definitional, serving as part of an error handling framework.\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No modifications are necessary. The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports correctly reflect this assessment.",
