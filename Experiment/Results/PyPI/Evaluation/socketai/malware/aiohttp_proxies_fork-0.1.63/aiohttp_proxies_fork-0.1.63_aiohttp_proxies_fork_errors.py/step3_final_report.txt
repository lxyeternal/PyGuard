  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues to facilitate error handling within a larger proxy system.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard Python exceptions; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks; no sinks related to external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static class definitions with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; straightforward class definitions with no methods or attributes beyond inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from standard exceptions. There are no data inputs, network operations, or dynamic behaviors. The structure is simple and static, serving as error indicators. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's benign and straightforward nature. The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No discrepancies or issues are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns. The reports accurately reflect this assessment, and the current scoring is appropriate. No modifications or further actions are necessary.",
