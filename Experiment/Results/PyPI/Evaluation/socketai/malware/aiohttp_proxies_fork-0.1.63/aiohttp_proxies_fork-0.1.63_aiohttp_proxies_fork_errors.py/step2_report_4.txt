  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the original code.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n- All reports correctly identify that there are no data flows, external inputs, or malicious behaviors.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is purely definitional, serving as error indicators within a larger system.\n\n**Specific observations:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   - The code contains only class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions.  \n   - No data processing, network activity, or external input/output occurs.  \n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.  \n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign and purely structural.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or 0.5 at most, which aligns with the code's nature.  \n   - Given the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity, scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   - Since the code is only class definitions with no dynamic behavior, higher scores are unjustified.  \n   - All reports appropriately assign low or zero scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   - No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.  \n   - Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- The current scores are appropriate.  \n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, just acknowledging the code's purpose in error handling, but no risk involved)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No issues present in the code.  \n- Scores are justified and should remain low.  \n- No further action needed.",
