  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports confirm that the code only defines custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n- They consistently note the absence of data flows, external inputs, or outputs.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The code is straightforward, purely declarative, and appears to be part of a larger error handling framework.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 and malware/security risk scores of 0.\n\n**Confirmations and issues:**\n- The code matches the description: it only defines exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable in their assessments.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the findings; no security risk detected.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since the code is only class definitions, the risk scores are correctly low.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious activity are justified based on this code alone.\n- The reports do not overstate the risk or malware potential.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n**Final note:**  \nIf this is part of a larger codebase, proper usage of these exceptions elsewhere would be necessary to ensure overall security, but based solely on this snippet, the assessment is sound.",
