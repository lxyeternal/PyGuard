  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general connection issues.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading observed in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external outputs, or data leaks present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are straightforward exception subclasses with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. There are no data sources, external inputs, or sinks. No suspicious code, malicious logic, or obfuscation detected. The code structure is standard for defining custom exceptions in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains only harmless exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
