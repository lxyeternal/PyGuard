{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports classes, functions, and constants related to proxy connection handling, specifically SOCKS proxy support.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes from local connector, errors, helpers, and proto files; no input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present; no data leaks, injections, or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code mainly imports and declares symbols for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The version number is standard; no malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a module that imports specific classes and functions, sets a version string, and defines __all__ for exports. It appears to be part of a larger package, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious activities. There are no inputs, outputs, or network operations. The code structure is straightforward, with clear organization. Since it only manages imports and exports, the likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup for proxy support, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It mainly handles definitions and package exports without performing any harmful actions.",
