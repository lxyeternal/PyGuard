  "purpose": "Module setup for a SOCKS proxy library, managing imports and exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto; version string; __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import statements to module namespace; no data flow or runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export structure, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module initialization file, importing components and defining exports. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscation are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured module setup for a SOCKS proxy library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
