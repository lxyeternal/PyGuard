  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Analysis:**\n   - The code is a typical module setup, importing various components (connectors, errors, helpers, protocol types) from local modules.\n   - It defines a version string and an `__all__` list for exports.\n   - There are no functions, dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code appears to be an `__init__.py` or module entry point for a SOCKS proxy package.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Considerations:**\n   - The code is straightforward, mainly managing imports and exports.\n   - No external input processing, network communication, or data sinks are visible.\n   - The structure and content are typical for a package setup.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n   - The version string is hardcoded but not suspicious.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious activity.\n   - They assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0.\n   - The confidence level is high (1) across all reports.\n\n4. **Assessment of Scores:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is evident.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate; no security risk is apparent in this setup code.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume that since this code only handles imports and exports, it cannot be malicious. This is reasonable.\n   - No suspicious patterns or behaviors are claimed or implied.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations or handle untrusted data.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a benign module setup for a SOCKS proxy library.\n   - No adjustments to scores are necessary based on the evidence.\n   - The high confidence and low scores are justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, non-malicious module initialization for a proxy library, with no security concerns detected.",
