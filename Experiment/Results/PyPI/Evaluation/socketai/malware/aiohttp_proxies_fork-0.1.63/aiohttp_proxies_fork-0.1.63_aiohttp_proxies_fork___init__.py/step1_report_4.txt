{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a part of a SOCKS proxy client or server, providing classes, error handling, and connection utilities related to proxy communication.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto; also defines __version__ and __all__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code primarily imports and defines exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; module mainly sets up interfaces and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code structure is typical for a package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes, errors, and helper functions from local modules, then exposes them via __all__ and defines a version string. No user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution observed. The structure suggests this is an initialization or packaging module. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization module for a SOCKS proxy utility, containing no malicious or suspicious elements. It mainly manages imports and exports of functions and classes. No security threats identified.",
