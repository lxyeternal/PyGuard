  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior**  \n   All reports conclude that the code is a straightforward module setup, importing and exporting components related to a SOCKS proxy library. No dynamic code execution, input handling, network operations, or suspicious patterns are identified. The code is static, with no obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \n   The reports are consistent in their assessment: the code is standard, well-structured, and benign. There are no logical flaws or mistakes in the reasoning. The code snippet is typical for an `__init__.py` or module setup file.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious activity is detected.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code clarity.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**  \n   Since the code is purely about module imports and exports, and no runtime or network activity is present, any claim suggesting potential vulnerabilities would be unfounded without additional context. The reports do not make such claims.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency and Reasonableness**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. The high confidence (1) across all reports is justified.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a benign, standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy library.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately. No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.",
