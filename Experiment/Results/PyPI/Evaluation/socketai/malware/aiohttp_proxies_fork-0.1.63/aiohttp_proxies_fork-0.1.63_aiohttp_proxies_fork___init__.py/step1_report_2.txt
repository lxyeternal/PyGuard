{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be part of a proxy connection library, providing classes, error handling, and helper functions for proxy communication.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and accesses version info and exported symbols; no external data input is explicitly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling that could lead to data leakage or malicious effects are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows; the code mainly defines imports and exports, with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or unusual behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports components from relative modules, defines a version string, and specifies exports. There are no dynamic code executions, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. It functions as a typical module setup for a larger package, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module setup for a proxy connection library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured part of a larger project.",
