{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up and export modules related to a SOCKS proxy implementation, including connectors, errors, helpers, and protocol types.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module imports and package metadata (__version__). It does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks for untrusted data or external communication within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks is visible in this code; it primarily defines and exports components.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements are present. The version string is hardcoded but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly imports components and defines an export list for a package. It does not execute any logic, handle input, or perform network operations. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or security risks are evident based solely on this code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup for a SOCKS proxy package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
