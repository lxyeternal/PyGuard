  "purpose": "This module appears to be part of a library for handling proxy connections, including creating connections and managing proxy types and errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto). No external input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network, file, or environment variable usage detected. No untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present; code mainly defines imports, constants, and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. Usage of standard import and export statements without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes, functions, and constants from local modules and defines the package version and __all__ exports. There are no signs of code execution, data handling, or external input/output. It is a straightforward module setup for a proxy library, with no indications of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup for a proxy connection library. No malicious activity, suspicious code, or security risks are apparent from this fragment.",
