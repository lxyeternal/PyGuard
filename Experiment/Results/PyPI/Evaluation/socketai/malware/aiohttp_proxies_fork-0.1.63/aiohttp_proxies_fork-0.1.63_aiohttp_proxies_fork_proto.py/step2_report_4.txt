  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the code's function—implementing SOCKS4/5 proxy wrappers, with standard address resolution, authentication, and socket communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors. The reasoning aligns with the code's structure.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the code as legitimate, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment appears accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, with a focus on standard proxy connection setup.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and standard error handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is legitimate, with a malware score of 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Properly describes the code's handling of proxy connections, hostname resolution, and authentication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. Uses standard libraries and protocols.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate assessment; malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns; assessment aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly states the code's function—SOCKS proxy wrappers with proper management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, and standard error handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately identifies the code as legitimate, malware score of 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound evaluation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the code's purpose and data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malicious behaviors. The code performs expected proxy functions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is legitimate, malware score of 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code detected.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the absence of evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, since no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's nature, a low to moderate risk score (~0.1–0.2) is appropriate, which matches the reports.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' evaluations. The code appears secure, legitimate, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.**",
