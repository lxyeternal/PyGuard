  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \nThe code implements asynchronous SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers, handling connection setup, hostname resolution, optional authentication, and data transfer. It uses standard libraries, follows protocol specifications, and includes appropriate error handling. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**  \n- **Purpose:** Standard SOCKS proxy wrappers, no issues.\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2  \n- **Analysis:** The reviewer finds no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is deemed legitimate with high confidence (0.9).  \n**Verdict:** **Reasonable.** The low malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**  \n- **Purpose:** Similar implementation, focusing on establishing proxy connections securely.\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1  \n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, and proper protocol handling.  \n**Verdict:** **Reasonable.** The minimal risk score aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above, with emphasis on proper address resolution and protocol compliance.\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2  \n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; code follows standard patterns.  \n**Verdict:** **Reasonable.** The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**  \n- **Purpose:** Reiterates the standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers.\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, and proper error handling.  \n**Verdict:** **Reasonable.** The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above, with focus on correct proxy negotiation.\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2  \n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious code or suspicious behavior; the implementation is standard.  \n**Verdict:** **Reasonable.** The low scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently assign 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward, protocol-compliant implementation.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, which is accurate; the code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk scores:** Ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concerns—mainly the potential for misuse if hostnames or credentials are untrusted, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Final Justification:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 – 0.2 (consistent with the reports)  \n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' assessments are reasonable, and the scores accurately reflect the code's security posture.",
