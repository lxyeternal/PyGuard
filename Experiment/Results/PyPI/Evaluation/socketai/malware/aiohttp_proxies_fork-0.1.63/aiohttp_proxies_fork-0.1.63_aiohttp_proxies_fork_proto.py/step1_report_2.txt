{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, primarily for establishing connections through proxies with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from socket receive operations, address resolution functions, and user-supplied hostnames and credentials.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to sockets via sock_sendall, and potentially sends user credentials during authentication. Uses socket connections which could potentially leak data if misused, but standard for proxy connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided hostnames/credentials through address resolution, authentication, and connection setup routines, culminating in socket connection establishment and proxy negotiation.",
  "anomalies": "Code performs normal proxy negotiation procedures; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No obfuscated code or unusual control flows; standard socket handling and error checking present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides proxy connection wrappers with proper asynchronous handling, address resolution, and error management. It manages credentials securely in memory (not hardcoded). The methods for negotiating proxy connections, including authentication, follow standard protocols. No suspicious data leaks, external network calls beyond typical proxy setup, or malicious logic detected. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns observed. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with appropriate error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious payloads. Overall, the code is safe and serves its intended purpose reliably.",
