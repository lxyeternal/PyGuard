{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, facilitating proxy connections with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads input from socket connections, user credentials (_user_id, _username, _password), hostnames, and DNS resolutions.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to the proxy server, reads server responses, resolves addresses, and possibly handles user credentials and hostnames.",
  "flows": "Inputs like hostnames and user credentials flow through address resolution and authentication steps; data is sent to and received from the proxy server; the socket connects to the proxy, then negotiates connection to destination.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No suspicious or unusual code constructs. Proper exception handling for network errors. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden data leaks. Use of standard libraries and clear separation of concerns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles network communication with proxy servers (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5). It resolves hostnames, manages socket connections, performs optional authentication, and handles responses according to protocol standards. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code relies on standard libraries, and exception handling appears appropriate. It does not contain obfuscated logic or suspicious network activity. The purpose aligns with legitimate proxy connection management, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of asynchronous SOCKS proxy socket wrappers with proper handling of protocols, errors, and address resolution. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected. It seems intended for proxy communication within a larger application framework.",
