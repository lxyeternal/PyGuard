{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, enabling proxy connection negotiations and data transfer.",
  "sources": "Input sources include host and port parameters, host resolution via getaddrinfo, and potentially untrusted input through hostname or user_id parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are socket send and receive functions, especially where data is constructed and transmitted for proxy negotiation. Data flows from untrusted inputs (hostnames, user credentials) to socket transmission.",
  "flows": "Untrusted hostnames or user credentials are processed and sent over sockets during proxy negotiation. Data flows from input parameters through address resolution and authentication steps to socket communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Code appears standard for proxy negotiation. No suspicious network addresses or data leaks are evident. Exception handling is conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code defines asynchronous proxy socket wrapper classes for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, handling connection, authentication, and address resolution securely. It performs hostname resolution, constructs appropriate proxy negotiation requests, and manages socket communication with proper exception handling. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code uses standard libraries and follows typical patterns for such implementations. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio, with no malicious or sabotage behavior detected. It performs expected proxy negotiation and socket management functions securely.",
