{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asynchronous socket communication, supporting proxy negotiation, connection, and authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads include user input for hostnames, port numbers, credentials, and data received from the socket during negotiation and data transfer.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to the proxy server, and receives data during negotiation, connection, and data transfer. No external untrusted data is written to files or executed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided hostnames, ports, and credentials into socket requests, with responses processed to establish proxy connections. Data is sent/received through socket wrappers, with no evidence of data leakage or command execution outside the intended socket communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code handles standard SOCKS proxy protocol communication. No unusual behaviors such as network communication to suspicious domains or system modification routines are present. Exception handling is conventional for socket operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers using asyncio. It correctly manages socket creation, address resolution, proxy negotiation, authentication, and connection establishment. It avoids executing untrusted data or writing to external systems. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or backdoors are detected. The code's structure and logic follow typical proxy communication patterns, with appropriate error handling. There is no evidence of obfuscation or malware; it appears to be a legitimate library for proxy communication.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It performs expected proxy negotiation functions securely without suspicious behaviors.",
