{
  "purpose": "The code implements asynchronous SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers for establishing network connections through proxies, handling hostname resolution, authentication, and data transfer.",
  "sources": "Hostname resolution via getaddrinfo, socket connection initiation, and optional credential inputs in memory.",
  "sinks": "Socket send and receive functions, potentially handling untrusted data during hostname resolution and connection negotiation.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from hostname resolution and user credentials (if any) through connection setup, authentication, and data transfer functions, with no external data exfiltration or command execution observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code adheres to standard protocols and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy clients using asyncio. It manages hostname resolution, connection, and authentication properly, with appropriate exception handling. No malicious behaviors, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The use of in-memory credentials and standard libraries further reduces suspicion. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misuse if untrusted hostnames or credentials are supplied, but no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk score (~0.1-0.2) accurately reflects the minimal security concern given the code's functionality.",
