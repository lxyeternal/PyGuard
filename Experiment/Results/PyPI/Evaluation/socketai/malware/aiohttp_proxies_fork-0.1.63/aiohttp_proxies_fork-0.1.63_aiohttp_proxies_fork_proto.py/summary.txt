  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk score (~0.1-0.2) accurately reflects the minimal security concern given the code's functionality."
