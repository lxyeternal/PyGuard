{
  "purpose": "This code implements asynchronous SOCKS proxy client wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling connection to proxies and forwarding traffic through them.",
  "sources": "Reads include input parameters such as host, port, username, password, and data received from network socket operations.",
  "sinks": "Network socket send and receive functions which send or receive data, potentially untrusted data, over network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through address resolution, request construction, authentication, and connection negotiation, ending in network transmission and reception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard network operations and address resolution is observed. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads identified. The code performs expected proxy negotiation procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for establishing proxy connections via SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols. It carefully manages network communication, including address resolution, protocol-specific handshake, authentication, and error handling. All data exchanges use standard socket operations, and there are no indications of malicious data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoor behaviors. Error handling is appropriate, and there are no signs of data leakage or system compromise. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of proxy client wrappers without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It performs expected proxy negotiation functions securely and appropriately.",
