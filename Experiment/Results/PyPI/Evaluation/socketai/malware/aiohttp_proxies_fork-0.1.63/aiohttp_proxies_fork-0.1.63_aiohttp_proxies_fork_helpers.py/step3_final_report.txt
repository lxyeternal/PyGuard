  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing SOCKS proxy URLs, creating socket wrappers, and establishing asynchronous network connections via SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parsing (parse_proxy_url), input parameters for host, port, proxy URL, and optional credentials.",
  "sinks": "Establishing socket connections and network communication through proxies; potential misuse if supplied with malicious proxy URLs.",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url extracts proxy type, host, port, username, password -> create_socket_wrapper creates socket based on proxy type -> connect via sock.connect or loop.create_connection to target host and port.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. Reliance on external input for proxy URLs could be exploited if malicious URLs are provided, but this is standard behavior for proxy utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for establishing network connections via SOCKS proxies, with proper validation and error handling. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of external proxy URLs introduces potential for misuse, but this is typical and not inherently malicious. The functions rely on standard libraries and known patterns, and the proxy socket wrappers are assumed to be standard or well-maintained. The scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility for SOCKS proxy connection handling in Python, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws. The potential risk stems from external input, which is typical for such utilities. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
