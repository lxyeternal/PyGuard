  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a utility for establishing network connections via SOCKS proxies, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5.\n- They consistently state that the code parses proxy URLs, creates socket wrappers, and connects to target hosts, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9 to 0.95), and malware scores are 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1 to 0.2), indicating minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct, with proper parameter validation and standard library usage.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No evident vulnerabilities such as injection, hardcoded secrets, or insecure defaults.\n- **Potential misuse:** The only concern is that untrusted proxy URLs could be supplied, but this is typical for proxy configuration and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent. The code is straightforward, with clear validation and error handling.\n- The only minor point is that the code relies on external validation of proxy URLs and parameters, but this is standard practice.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher (0.2), but justified given the potential for misuse if malicious URLs are supplied. However, this is a standard risk for proxy configuration, not a flaw in the code itself.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign scores above 0.5; all are low, which is appropriate.\n- If any were higher, it would require evidence of malicious behavior, which is absent here.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code's use of `asyncio` and proxy URL parsing is standard.\n- No suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The code could be misused if supplied with malicious proxy URLs, but this is typical for such utilities.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk score:** 0.2 (standard for proxy configuration code, considering potential misuse)\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The code appears legitimate and safe.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary based on the provided reports.\n- For a conservative approach, maintaining the low malware and obfuscated scores is justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to potential misuse, but not inherent maliciousness)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-implemented proxy connection utility with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws.",
