{
  "purpose": "The code performs base64 decoding, dynamic compilation, and execution of potentially malicious payloads, with an initial benign print statement serving as a distraction.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string decoded via 'b64decode', imported modules within decoded code, network requests, file operations, and dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded code via 'exec', network operations (HTTP requests), file system modifications, potential remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoding -> compilation -> execution of decoded code; initial print statement is unrelated and benign.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation through base64 encoding, dynamic compile and exec, import statements within decoded payload, initial benign print statement as a distraction.",
  "analysis": "The code decodes a base64 string, compiles, and executes it, which is a common pattern in malicious scripts to conceal payloads. The decoded code imports modules, performs network requests, and potentially executes remote code. The initial print statement is harmless and unrelated. The obfuscation techniques and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent. The high use of encoding and runtime code generation warrants a high malware score. The code's pattern aligns with known malicious obfuscated scripts, indicating a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, heavily obfuscated, and likely malicious, capable of executing arbitrary code, performing network operations, and exfiltrating data. It warrants a high-security alert and further investigation.",
