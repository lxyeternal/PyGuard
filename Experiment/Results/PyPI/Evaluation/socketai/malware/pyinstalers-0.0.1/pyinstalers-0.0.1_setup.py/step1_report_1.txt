  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'pyinstalers'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, license, authors, author_email, description, long_description, keywords, and packages.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling; the code simply configures package metadata.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code does not process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The author_email appears normal, and no malicious code or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata. It contains no dynamic code, no data input handling, and no suspicious functions or obfuscated patterns. The data appears to be static, benign, and typical for a package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to configure package metadata without any malicious intent.",
