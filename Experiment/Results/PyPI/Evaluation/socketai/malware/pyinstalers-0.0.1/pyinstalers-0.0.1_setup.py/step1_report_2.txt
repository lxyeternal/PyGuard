{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the package metadata for a Python project named 'pyinstalers'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string literals for package metadata such as name, version, license, authors, author_email, description, long_description, keywords, and packages.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows or where untrusted data could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The code only assigns static values to the setup() function parameters; no data flows from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools to define package metadata. It contains only static, hardcoded string values with no dynamic execution, input handling, or external data. The package name 'pyinstalers' appears to be a typo of 'pyinstallers' or similar, but this is not inherently malicious. No suspicious activity or malicious behavior is detected. The code is well-structured and follows standard conventions for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any external operations, data collection, or dynamic code execution.",
