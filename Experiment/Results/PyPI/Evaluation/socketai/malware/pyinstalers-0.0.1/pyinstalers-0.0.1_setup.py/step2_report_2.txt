  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports:\n\n**Code Review:**\n\nThe code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools, defining package metadata with static string literals. It contains no dynamic code, no user input handling, no external data processing, or obfuscated/malicious constructs. The only minor anomaly is the package name \"pyinstalers,\" which appears to be a typo of \"pyinstallers\" or similar, but this is likely accidental and not malicious.\n\n**Report Summaries:**\n\nAll five reports concur that the code is benign, with no suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security risks. They note the static nature of the script, absence of data flows, and no external interactions. The only concern raised is the typo in the package name, which is not inherently malicious but could be misleading.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports — correct, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports — correct, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1 due to the typo concern. Given the lack of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities, this is reasonable.\n- **Confidence levels:** 1 in most reports, indicating high certainty in benign assessment; one report has 0.9, reflecting minor uncertainty about the typo.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no suspicious code or behaviors are present.\n- The typo in the package name is noted but does not constitute a security concern.\n- No external data, secrets, or code execution present.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional Recommendations:**\n\n- Consider correcting the package name to avoid confusion, but this does not impact security.\n- No further action needed regarding security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nBased on the code and reports, I concur that the package setup script is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor typo does not elevate the risk score.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and consensus from the reports.",
