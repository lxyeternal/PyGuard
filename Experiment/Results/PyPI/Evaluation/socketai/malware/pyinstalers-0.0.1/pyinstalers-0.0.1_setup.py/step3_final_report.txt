{
  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata for a Python project using setuptools, with static string literals and no dynamic or external input.",
  "sources": "Static string literals in the setup() function parameters, including name, version, license, authors, author_email, description, long_description, keywords, and packages.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks or external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code solely assigns static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in package name 'pyinstalers' which appears to be an accidental misspelling but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static metadata, no dynamic code, no external data handling, and no obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The only concern is the package name typo, which does not imply malicious intent but could cause confusion. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score 0, reflecting the benign and standard nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only minor issue is a typographical error in the package name, which does not constitute a security risk. All reports are consistent with this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
