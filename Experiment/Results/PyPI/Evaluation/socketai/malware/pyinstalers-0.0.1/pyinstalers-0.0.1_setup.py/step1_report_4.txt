{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the Python package 'pyinstalers' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Input data from the 'setup' function parameters such as package name, version, author info, description, and keywords.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data processing or output handling is performed.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a straightforward setup script with no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'pyinstalers' appears to be a typo of 'pyinstallers', but this is likely accidental rather than malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with package metadata. It does not include code execution, data input/output, or external network interactions. The structure is typical for Python package setup scripts. No obfuscated or malicious code is present. The only concern is the potential typo in the package name, which does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior detected. There are no security risks or anomalies beyond a minor typo in the package name, which does not impact security.",
