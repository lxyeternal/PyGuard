  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard setup script using setuptools.\n- All reports agree that the code is static, benign, and contains no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- The only noted anomaly is the package name \"pyinstalers,\" which appears to be a typo of \"pyinstallers\" or similar, but this is not inherently malicious.\n- No external data, input handling, or suspicious code constructs are present.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Presence of static package metadata:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static and contains no malicious code.\n- **Typo in package name:** \"pyinstalers\" appears to be a typo, but this is likely accidental and not malicious.\n- **No dynamic code, input handling, or external dependencies:** Confirmed across all reports.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:\n- **No significant flaws** are evident in the reports. They are consistent and accurate.\n- **Potential overinterpretation of the typo:** The reports mention the typo but correctly dismiss it as non-malicious.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the static, clear code.\n- **Risk score:** Most reports assign 0, with one report giving 0.1 due to the typo concern, which is reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The only minor concern is the typo in the package name, which does not impact security but could be misleading or cause packaging issues.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent.\n- The analysis correctly identifies that the code is benign.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — No malicious code present.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is straightforward and readable.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — No security risk, only a typo which is non-malicious.\n\n**Additional note:** While the typo might cause confusion or packaging issues, it does not constitute a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                 | No malicious behavior or code present.                       |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                 | Code is clear, static, and straightforward.                   |\n| Security Risk   | 0                 | No vulnerabilities, external data handling, or suspicious activity. |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security issues. The only minor concern is the typo in the package name, which is not a security threat but could be corrected for clarity.",
