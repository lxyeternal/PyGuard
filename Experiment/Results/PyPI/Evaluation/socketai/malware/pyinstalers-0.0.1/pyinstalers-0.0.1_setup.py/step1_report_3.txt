{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyinstalers' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from the setup() function parameters such as package name, version, license, authors, email, description, and keywords.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; all data are hardcoded string literals and static lists within the script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be a straightforward package setup script without any obfuscated or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with static arguments defining package metadata. No external input, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The author information, license, and package details seem normal for a setup script. There is no code execution, network activity, or credential handling, and no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign configuration file for publishing a Python package.",
