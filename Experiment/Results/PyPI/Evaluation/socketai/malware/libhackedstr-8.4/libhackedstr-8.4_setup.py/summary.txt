  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during setup. The package could serve as a vector for malicious payloads, with the obfuscation and hidden execution indicating malicious intent. The scores should reflect high malware, obfuscation, and security risk levels."
