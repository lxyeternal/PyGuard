{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package called 'tpramhydracpu' with package details and attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command if a specific file does not exist.",
  "sources": "Reading the file system for 'tahg' and 'dl.dr0pbox.com/szgnqyqb0qmv/ESQUELEL.EXE', environment variables (indirectly through subprocess), and package metadata input.",
  "sinks": "Execution of a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen, which could potentially run arbitrary code or download malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code executes a PowerShell encoded command, which may download or run malicious code, representing a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of PowerShell encoded command with -WindowStyle Hidden, running without visible window, suggesting an attempt to conceal activity. The hardcoded domain 'dl.dr0pbox.com' and filename 'ESQUELEL.EXE' are suspicious. The try-except blocks suppress errors, hiding failures. The presence of potentially malicious PowerShell command embedded as an encoded string is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing setup from distutils.core and attempts to import subprocess and os. If the file 'tahg' does not exist, it executes a PowerShell encoded command via subprocess.Popen with the window hidden, potentially to download or execute a payload from 'dl.dr0pbox.com'. The encoded command's purpose is unclear but highly suspicious. The setup() function defines package metadata, which appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the prior suspicious code. Errors are suppressed in both try blocks, which can hide malicious activity or failures. Overall, the code’s main malicious indicator is the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command under conditions designed to conceal activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script includes a suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, which could be used for malicious purposes such as downloading or executing malware. The package setup appears benign but is overshadowed by the potentially malicious behavior. The overall risk is high due to concealed command execution.",
