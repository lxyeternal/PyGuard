{
  "purpose": "This code implements a module that dynamically imports submodules on demand, providing lazy loading of specific components such as 'easter', 'parser', and others.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own __all__ list to determine which submodules can be imported lazily; it also attempts to import a version string from a local _version module.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this code; it does not execute any untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "The code flows from checking the availability of a version, then dynamically importing modules based on attribute access, and finally listing available attributes including lazy-imported modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The dynamic import mechanism is standard for lazy loading and does not pose an immediate risk.",
  "analysis": "The code provides lazy loading of submodules via __getattr__, which is a standard pattern in Python to delay importing modules until needed. It safely checks the attribute name against an explicit list (__all__). There are no code injections, suspicious network activity, or malicious behavior detected. The version import attempt is a typical pattern for handling optional local versioning. Overall, the structure appears safe and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This module uses standard techniques for lazy importing of submodules with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It functions as a typical package loader without any indicators of supply chain risks or malware.",
