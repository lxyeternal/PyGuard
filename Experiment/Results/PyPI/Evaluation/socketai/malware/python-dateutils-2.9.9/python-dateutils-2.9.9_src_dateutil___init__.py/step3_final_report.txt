{
  "purpose": "Implement a Python package initializer that lazily imports submodules listed in __all__ when accessed, and attempts to read version info from a local _version module.",
  "sources": "Access to __all__ attribute for module names, importlib.import_module for dynamic import, and version import from _version module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks; dynamic import restricted to controlled module names in __all__.",
  "flows": "Access to attribute in module triggers __getattr__, which imports the corresponding submodule via importlib.import_module.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard pattern for lazy loading with controlled import scope.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a controlled lazy import pattern via __getattr__, importing modules only from a predefined list __all__, which mitigates risks of arbitrary code execution. The version import fallback is standard. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The dynamic import is limited and safe. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of lazy-loading modules in Python, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain risks. The scores and assessments in the reports are justified and accurate.",
