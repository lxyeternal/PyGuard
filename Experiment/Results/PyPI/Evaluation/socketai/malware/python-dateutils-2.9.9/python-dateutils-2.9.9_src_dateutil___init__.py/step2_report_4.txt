  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard lazy-loading pattern with no malicious behavior detected. The use of importlib.import_module with fixed module names in __all__ is safe. The report correctly identifies no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem appropriate given the lack of vulnerabilities, but the risk score is slightly above zero possibly due to the dynamic import pattern. This is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard lazy-loading with no malicious activity. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 are appropriate; the report suggests no security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Well justified; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is a typical pattern for lazy module importation, with no malicious behavior or backdoors. The use of __getattr__ is controlled via __all__.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct reasoning and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with a version import fallback and controlled dynamic import via __getattr__. No suspicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid analysis and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, the code uses lazy import with restrictions, no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, setting malware=0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree on 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in all cases, justified by the dynamic import pattern, which could be exploited if not properly restricted. However, since the import is limited to a fixed list (__all__), the risk remains low.\n\n**Final Expert Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, controlled dynamic import pattern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. The code appears safe, with no supply chain or malicious concerns.",
