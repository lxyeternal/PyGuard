{
  "purpose": "This code implements a 'relativedelta' class for date and time manipulation, providing operations to add or subtract relative time intervals from datetime objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads input primarily from the constructor parameters and datetime objects. It also accesses system date/time information via the calendar module and datetime module.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that lead to untrusted data leaks or malicious actions such as network communication, file modification, or command execution.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves constructing relativedelta objects based on input parameters or differences between date/datetime objects. Operations like addition (__add__, __radd__) and subtraction (__sub__, __rsub__) involve manipulating datetime objects and their components but do not perform any unsafe or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on standard library functions and constructs for date arithmetic. The only minor note is a warning about non-integer absolute values, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a relative timedelta class, allowing detailed manipulation of date and time objects. It performs arithmetic operations, comparisons, and normalization of time intervals. It does not include any network access, system modifications, or obfuscated logic. The presence of warnings for non-integer absolute values is a precautionary measure, not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a typical, well-structured date utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard date manipulation utility implementing relativedelta operations. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe for use in applications requiring date arithmetic.",
