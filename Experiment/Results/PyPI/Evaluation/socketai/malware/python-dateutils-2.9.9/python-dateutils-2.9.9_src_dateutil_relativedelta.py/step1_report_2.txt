{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python class 'relativedelta' for manipulating date and time intervals, including arithmetic operations and date adjustments, often used in date calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from datetime objects, date components (years, months, days, etc.), and optional parameters like weekday, yearday, and nlyearday.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include arithmetic operations (__add__, __sub__, __mul__, etc.) involving datetime objects and timedelta, which could be misused if combined with malicious inputs to affect system time or extract data indirectly.",
  "flows": "Input sources (datetime objects and parameters) flow through constructor, adjustments, and arithmetic methods to produce new datetime or relativedelta instances; however, no external network or file I/O is involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or hidden code present. The code mainly involves date calculations, with no evidence of obfuscated logic, malicious network activity, or system modification commands.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily implements date interval manipulations, including relative and absolute adjustments, with comprehensive handling of edge cases like leap years and weekday calculations. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No signs of code obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected. The arithmetic and date handling appear standard and consistent with dateutil's relativedelta functionality. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a date manipulation utility with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It provides date arithmetic features without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
