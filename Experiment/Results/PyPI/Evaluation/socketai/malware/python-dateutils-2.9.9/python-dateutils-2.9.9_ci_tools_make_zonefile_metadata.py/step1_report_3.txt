  "purpose": "Generate a JSON metadata file containing SHA-512 checksum and version info for a specified tzdata tarball file.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line arguments: 'tzdata' (tarball filename), 'version' (tzdata version), 'out' (output filename, optional).",
  "sinks": "File operations: reading the specified tarball file, writing the metadata JSON file.",
  "flows": "Read tarball filename -> calculate_sha512 reads the file -> generate JSON metadata -> write metadata to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or unusual code behaviors observed. The script performs straightforward hashing and file I/O.",
  "analysis": "The script imports hashlib to compute SHA-512 hash of a specified file, specified via command-line arguments. It formats a JSON template with metadata details and writes it to an output file. The code is simple, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs, and it does not perform network operations or access sensitive data beyond file I/O. The use of standard libraries and straightforward logic indicates no malicious intent. The only potential concern is that it reads and hashes a user-specified file, which is a normal operation for checksum verification but could be misused if supplied with malicious files, though that is outside the scope of the script's function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility to generate metadata and checksum for a given file. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and performs legitimate operations. No malware or security risks are identified.",
