{
  "purpose": "Generate a JSON metadata file containing information and SHA-512 checksum for a specified tzdata tarball file.",
  "sources": "The tzdata filename and version are provided via command-line arguments; the file is read in the calculate_sha512 function.",
  "sinks": "The SHA-512 checksum is computed and then the formatted metadata is written to an output file specified via command-line argument.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (tzdata filename) -> calculate_sha512 reads the file -> checksum returned -> formatted into JSON template -> written to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; the script performs straightforward file hashing and file writing without hidden or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script securely reads a specified file, computes its SHA-512 hash, and writes metadata including the hash to a JSON file. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. It relies on the filesystem for input, and outputs to a file, both standard operations for checksum tools. No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no code injection points are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for creating metadata with a checksum for a tzdata file. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
