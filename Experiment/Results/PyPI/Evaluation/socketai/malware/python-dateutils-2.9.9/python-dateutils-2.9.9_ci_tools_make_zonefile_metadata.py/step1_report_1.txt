{
  "purpose": "Generate a metadata JSON file containing information and SHA-512 checksum of a specified tzdata tarball.",
  "sources": "Input arguments 'tzdata' (filename) and 'version' (string), and file reading in 'calculate_sha512' function.",
  "sinks": "File writing to 'out' (default 'zonefile_metadata.json'), reading the specified tzdata file.",
  "flows": "Input arguments → 'calculate_sha512' reads the tzdata file → checksum is formatted into metadata string → metadata string is written to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a specified tzdata tarball file, calculates its SHA-512 hash, and generates a JSON-formatted metadata file with release info and zonegroups. No user input is executed as code; the process is straightforward. The only potential risk is if untrusted input file paths are supplied, which could lead to reading sensitive files or errors, but this is standard behavior and not malicious. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate function of checksum calculation and metadata generation for tzdata files without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a simple utility script.",
