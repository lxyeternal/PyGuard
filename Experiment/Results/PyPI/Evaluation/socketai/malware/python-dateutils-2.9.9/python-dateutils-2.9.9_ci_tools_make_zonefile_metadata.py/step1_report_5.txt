  "purpose": "Generate zonefile metadata by computing SHA-512 checksum of a specified tzdata tarball and outputting formatted JSON metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the tzdata tarball file specified by the user through command-line argument.",
  "sinks": "Writes the generated JSON metadata to an output file specified by the user.",
  "flows": "Reads tzdata file -> Computes SHA-512 hash -> Formats JSON string with metadata -> Writes JSON to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code performs straightforward file hashing and file writing. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or external network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python libraries to read a user-specified file, compute its SHA-512 hash, and generate a JSON formatted metadata string which is then saved to a file. All operations are directly related to data processing and file I/O. There are no code injection points, no network communication, and no suspicious dynamic code execution. The code performs as expected for a utility script, with clear and conventional structure. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for generating metadata about tzdata files, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
