  "purpose": "The script updates timezone data files by downloading from mirror URLs, verifies the integrity with SHA-512, and rebuilds timezone information.",
  "sources": "Reads metadata from a JSON file ('zonefile_metadata.json'), including URLs, filenames, and SHA-512 hashes. Downloads files using request.urlretrieve.",
  "sinks": "Reads files from disk ('tzdata_file'), performs SHA-512 hash verification, and calls 'rebuild' to process timezone data.",
  "flows": "Metadata file -> download URL(s) -> file download -> file content -> SHA-512 hash computation -> rebuild process",
  "anomalies": "Uses assertion to verify SHA-512 hash; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual or obfuscated code; standard library functions are used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code loads metadata from a JSON file, iterates over mirror URLs to download timezone data if not present locally, and verifies the download via SHA-512 checksum. It employs exception handling during download attempts and ensures data integrity before processing. The 'rebuild' function is called to update timezone info. No code injection, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. Use of assertions for hash verification is typical and not suspicious. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and all operations are standard for update scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs legitimate timezone data updates with integrity checks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected. It appears to be a normal, well-structured update utility with no security risks identified.",
