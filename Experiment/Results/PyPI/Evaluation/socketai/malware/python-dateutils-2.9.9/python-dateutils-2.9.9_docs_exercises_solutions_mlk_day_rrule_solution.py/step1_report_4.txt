{
  "purpose": "Define and test a recurrence rule for Martin Luther King Jr. Day (third Monday of January) using dateutil's rrule, and verify the dates within specified ranges.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from predefined test cases and uses the dateutil.rrule module to generate recurrence dates.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process or output untrusted data; it only performs date calculations and assertions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; test inputs are hardcoded, and no external input or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with clear use of dateutil to generate recurring dates based on a rule. No hardcoded secrets or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'rrule' from 'dateutil' to define a recurrence rule for MLK Day, occurring on the third Monday of January annually. It includes test cases to verify that the rule produces expected dates within given ranges. The rule is configured with specific start date, frequency, month, and weekday. The test function asserts that the generated dates match expected values for each range. The code concludes by executing tests and printing 'Success!' if all assertions pass. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. No external network activity, credential handling, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script securely and correctly computes the dates of MLK Day for specified periods, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward, safe date calculation utility with embedded test cases.",
