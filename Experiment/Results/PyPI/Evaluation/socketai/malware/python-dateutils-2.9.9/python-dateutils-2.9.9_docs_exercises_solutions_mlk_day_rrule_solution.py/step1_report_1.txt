{
  "purpose": "Calculate the dates of Martin Luther King Jr. Day (third Monday of January) for specified date ranges using the dateutil rrule library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input date ranges from the MLK_TEST_CASES list to test the rrule.between method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input date ranges flow into the test_mlk_day function, which compares expected dates with those generated by the rrule object MLK_DAY; no data flows into external systems or sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are evident. The code uses standard library functions and well-known third-party modules without obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a recurrence rule for MLK Day, then tests it against several date ranges to verify correct output. The rule is constructed using the dateutil.rrule library, specifying a third Monday of January starting from 1986. The tests compare expected MLK Day dates with the rrule.between method output. The implementation appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden code. It solely performs date calculations and comparisons. No untrusted inputs, code injection, or harmful side-effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard date calculations with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward, well-structured implementation for computing MLK Day dates and verifying correctness.",
