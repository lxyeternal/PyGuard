{
  "purpose": "Calculate the dates of Martin Luther King Jr. Day (MLK Day) for each year using recurrence rules and test the correctness of the date calculations within specified ranges.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'datetime' module, 'rrule' from 'dateutil', and input data from the 'MLK_TEST_CASES' list.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'rrule.between()' method to produce a list of datetime objects within given ranges, with no untrusted input sources or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input date ranges from 'MLK_TEST_CASES' flow into the 'test_mlk_day()' function which calls 'MLK_DAY.between()' to produce date lists; these are compared to expected outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears straightforward, with clear date calculations and tests.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and dateutil for date calculations. It defines a recurrence rule for MLK Day, which is the third Monday in January starting from 1986. It also provides test cases to verify the correct dates. The code only reads static modules and data; there are no dynamic inputs, user inputs, or external data sources involved. The logic is standard and correctly implemented for its purpose. There are no signs of obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behavior. The testing function asserts expected behavior and outputs success messages. Overall, the code is safe and intended for date calculations and testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of date recurrence calculation for MLK Day with accompanying tests. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are present. It is safe for use.",
