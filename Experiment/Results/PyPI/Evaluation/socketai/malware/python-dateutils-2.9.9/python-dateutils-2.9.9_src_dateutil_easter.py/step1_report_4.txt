{
  "purpose": "Calculate the date of Easter for a given year using different calendar algorithms (Julian, Orthodox, Western).",
  "sources": "Input parameters: year and method; data retrieved from function arguments and local variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leakage, external network access, or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Input 'year' and 'method' flow into calculations; the resulting date is returned as a datetime.date object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of known algorithms for calculating Easter dates based on different calendar systems. It uses standard Python features and mathematical operations. No external data sources, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The calculations are based solely on input parameters and internal mathematical formulas, following well-established algorithms. The constants and functions are clearly documented. No evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code segments was found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented implementation of Easter date algorithms with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
