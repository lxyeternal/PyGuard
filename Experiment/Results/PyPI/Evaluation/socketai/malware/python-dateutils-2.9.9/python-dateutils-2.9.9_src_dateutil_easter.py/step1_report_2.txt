{
  "purpose": "Provides a method to calculate Easter date using different calendar algorithms (Julian, Orthodox, Western).",
  "sources": "Reads the input parameter 'year' and 'method'; uses standard 'datetime' module for date creation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no external data transmission or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "Input 'year' and 'method' influence calculation of date; date object is returned but not used to send data externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code implements a standard astronomical calculation with clear logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Easter date calculations based on well-documented algorithms. It validates the 'method' parameter, performs date calculations based on the method, and returns a date object. No suspicious external network activity, data leakage, or malicious code patterns are present. The use of standard Python modules and algorithms indicates benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for computing Easter dates using established algorithms. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment.",
