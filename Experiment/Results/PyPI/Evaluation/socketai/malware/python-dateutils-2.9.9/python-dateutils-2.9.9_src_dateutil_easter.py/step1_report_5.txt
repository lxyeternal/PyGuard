{
  "purpose": "Calculate Easter date based on different algorithms (Julian, Orthodox, Western) for a given year.",
  "sources": "Input: 'year' and 'method' parameters; data from the 'datetime' module.",
  "sinks": "None identified that process untrusted data insecurely or leak information.",
  "flows": "Input 'year' and 'method' flow into calculations, ultimately producing a date object with no external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code performs standard date calculations based on well-known algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-documented, standard algorithms for calculating Easter dates using straightforward arithmetic and modular operations. No network operations, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code relies solely on input parameters and a standard library (datetime). The calculations are deterministic and do not involve dynamic code execution or external data sources. Constants and calculations are transparent and consistent with known algorithms for Easter determination.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Easter date calculations without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is safe for use and does not contain malware or security risks.",
