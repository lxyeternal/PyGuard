  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of Easter date algorithms with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is well-structured, documented, and free of suspicious patterns. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and the obfuscation score is zero. Overall, the code is safe for use in any context requiring Easter date calculations."
