{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to calculate Easter date based on different algorithms and calendar systems",
  "sources": "Reads input year, method parameter, and system date functions",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted input (year and method) to generate a date, but only for calculation, not affecting external systems",
  "flows": "Input (year, method) -> Calculation of Easter date -> Output date object",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; standard date calculations; no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-documented algorithms for calculating Easter dates based on Julian, Orthodox, and Western methods. It validates input parameters for method correctness. Uses standard arithmetic and date handling functions. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a clean implementation of known algorithms without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate astronomical date calculations for Easter without any malicious intent or suspicious activity. It only processes provided input data to output a date object, with no evidence of security risks or malware.",
