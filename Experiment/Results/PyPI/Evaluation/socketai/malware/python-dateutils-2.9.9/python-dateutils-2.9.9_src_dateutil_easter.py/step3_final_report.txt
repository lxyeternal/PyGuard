{
  "purpose": "Calculates Easter dates for a given year using Julian, Orthodox, or Western algorithms, based on established astronomical and calendar computations.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'year' and 'method' for selecting calculation algorithm",
  "sinks": "None; internal date calculation without external data or network interactions",
  "flows": "Input 'year' and 'method' influence calculations, leading to a date object as output",
  "anomalies": "None; standard implementation with no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-known, documented algorithms for Easter date calculation. It performs arithmetic operations based on input parameters, validates 'method', and returns a date object. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data handling. The logic is straightforward, deterministic, and aligns with established formulas. Input validation is minimal but sufficient for the scope. No external interactions or side effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of Easter date algorithms with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is well-structured, documented, and free of suspicious patterns. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and the obfuscation score is zero. Overall, the code is safe for use in any context requiring Easter date calculations.",
