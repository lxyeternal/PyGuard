{
  "purpose": "Provides a method to calculate the date of Easter for a given year using different algorithms.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (year, method).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used in a harmful way; the code performs standard date calculations.",
  "flows": "Inputs (year, method) → Conditional logic and calculations → Return of date object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard math operations, conditional logic, and date handling with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a well-documented algorithm for calculating Easter dates with options for Julian, Orthodox, and Western methods. It performs straightforward mathematical calculations based on inputs without involving external systems, network communication, or data leakage points. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors are present. All operations are standard date and arithmetic calculations. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Easter date calculations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe, clean, and intended solely for date computation purposes.",
