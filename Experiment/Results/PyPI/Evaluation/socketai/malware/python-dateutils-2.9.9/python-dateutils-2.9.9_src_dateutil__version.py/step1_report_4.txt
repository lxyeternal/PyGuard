  "purpose": "To define the version information for a Python package using setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string assigned to __version__ and version variables.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only assigns static data without processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "None; static assignment with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates the file is generated automatically and should not be modified or tracked in version control, which is typical for build metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, generated snippet for versioning, setting version variables to a static string. No user input, environment variables, or external data are used. The code does not perform any operations beyond variable assignments. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, autogenerated version declaration file with no malicious intent or security risks.",
