  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code.\n\n**Code review:**\n```python\n# coding: utf-8\n# file generated by setuptools_scm\n# don't change, don't track in version control\n__version__ = version = '2.9.9'\n__version_tuple__ = version_tuple = (2, 9, 9)\n```\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code only assigns static version information to variables.\n- No input handling, external data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n- Comments explicitly state that the file is auto-generated and should not be modified.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- No data sinks, external communications, or data flows from untrusted sources.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Define package version info.\n- Conclusion: Benign, auto-generated, no malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Evaluation:** Accurate. The report correctly identifies the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Conclusion: Straightforward, non-malicious.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Evaluation:** Also accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Define version info.\n- Conclusion: Benign, generated by setuptools_scm.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Evaluation:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Version declaration.\n- Conclusion: Harmless, auto-generated.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Evaluation:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Package version info.\n- Conclusion: Standard, harmless, generated code.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Evaluation:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is an auto-generated, static version assignment script with no malicious intent.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security issues are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and the analysis provided.",
