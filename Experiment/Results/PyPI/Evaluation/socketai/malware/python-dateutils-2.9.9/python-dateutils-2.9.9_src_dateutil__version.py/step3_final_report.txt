  "purpose": "Define static version information for the package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments (__version__, __version_tuple__) with comments indicating auto-generation.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static data, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns version info to variables with comments indicating auto-generation. No input handling, external data processing, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The code is benign and serves as metadata. All reports correctly identify this as a safe, auto-generated version info file. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version information snippet with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
  "confidence": 1,
