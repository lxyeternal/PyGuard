  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code only assigns static version variables, generated by setuptools_scm. No input, external data, or suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified, as there's no security concern.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward variable assignments with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, simple static assignment, auto-generated, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, static version info with comments indicating auto-generation.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, fitting the benign profile.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—static assignment, auto-generated, no external data or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns static variables with no external input or malicious activity.\n- **Malware scores:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Correctly 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk scores:** Justified as 0, given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely for version management, auto-generated, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n- No changes needed to scores; they are consistent and appropriate.\n\n### Personal assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
