  "anomalies": "Comment indicating generated file; no suspicious or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, setting version info with hardcoded values, accompanied by comments about auto-generation. No inputs, outputs, or potentially malicious behaviors are evident. It does not perform any operations beyond assigning static version data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, harmless version annotation generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
