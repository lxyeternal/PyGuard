  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific function or task, but it is not explicitly clear without the actual code content.",
  "sources": "Input data could come from user input, environment variables, or external files if present, but no specific sources are identifiable without the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if present; however, none are explicitly observed without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be determined without concrete code lines; typically involves data reading and subsequent processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are detectable without the actual code content.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information to perform a detailed step-by-step analysis. No code content was provided for review, making it impossible to identify sources, sinks, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, no malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks can be determined. Please provide the code for a thorough review.",
