  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, focusing on code patterns, data flows, and suspicious features.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user input, environment variables, files, and network endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network communication, file writing, dynamic code execution via eval() or exec(), and import functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions into sinks, especially where untrusted data is evaluated or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on untrusted data, hardcoded URLs or credentials, dynamic imports, obfuscation, complex variable names, and suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits dynamic features such as eval() and dynamic imports, which are typical indicators of obfuscation or malicious intent. Hardcoded URLs and network communication suggest potential data exfiltration or command-and-control activity. The obfuscation and complex variable naming further increase suspicion. No evidence of benign functionality or standard library usage that would justify benign classification. The presence of eval() on untrusted data significantly raises the malware risk. Overall, the code shows high potential for malicious behavior, with dynamic code execution and network activity being primary concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code likely contains malicious elements, primarily due to dynamic code execution and suspicious network communication. The malware score should be increased to reflect the high probability of malicious intent, and the security risk should be considered high. The obfuscation adds to the suspicion but is secondary to the code's dynamic and network behaviors.",
