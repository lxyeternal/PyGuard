  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source Python dependency, identifying potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, dynamic code execution points, data reading functions, environment variable access, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file write/read operations, environment variable usage, dynamic code execution, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) to processing functions, then to sinks such as network or file system, possibly via obfuscated or complex control flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, complex control flow, suspicious structure without clear purpose, potential hardcoded secrets or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily benign with straightforward logic, no suspicious activity, and no obfuscation. One report indicates obfuscation and complex control flow, raising suspicion but without confirmed malicious actions. The scores assigned reflect these observations: low malware likelihood (0-0.4), moderate obfuscation (0.7), and moderate security risk (0.55). The confidence levels align with the evidence. No concrete malicious behavior is detected, but obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring. The overall assessment supports conservative scores, with slight adjustments possible if further analysis confirms malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears safe with no malicious intent; obfuscation in one report suggests suspicion but not confirmed malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the observations. A slight increase in malware score in the suspicious report could be considered if further evidence emerges, but current scores are appropriate.",
