  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to sinks through various processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. No embedded backdoors or hidden data transmission observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing common libraries and standard programming constructs. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated sections, or network activity is evident. No data leaks or privacy violations are apparent. The structure and formatting are typical for benign Python scripts. Without external context or hidden code, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the code review, there are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code appears to be safe, with no malicious logic or suspicious anomalies identified.",
