{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard operations typical of a Python package, such as importing modules, defining functions, and executing main routines.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user inputs (if any), and external modules or files read during execution.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are network connections, file writes, or execution of system commands that could be misused if provided with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to sinks through various functions, especially if user input or environment variables are used unsafely.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or unusual code constructs are apparent. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a standard package.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines functions with clear purposes. No obfuscated language features or dynamic code execution are present. No hardcoded secrets or hidden backdoors are detected. There are no signs of malicious network activity or data exfiltration routines. The code appears to be a normal Python package routine, with no suspicious logic or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard package code without obfuscated or malicious elements.",
