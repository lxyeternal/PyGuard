{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation or development setup, executes a potentially malicious system command.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in the notmalfunc() function that is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executing the decoded command which makes an HTTP request to an external URL.",
  "flows": "The notmalfunc() function is called during the 'install' command, decoding the base64 string and executing it with os.system, resulting in a network request.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate a system command, execution of decoded code via os.system, and triggering during package installation suggest malicious intent. The URL accessed is suspicious and could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools modules and other libraries, then defines a function to decode base64-encoded code. The function 'notmalfunc' decodes a base64 string that, when decoded, runs a curl command to an external IP address, likely initiating an HTTP request. This function is called during the 'install' process via a custom 'AfterInstall' class, which executes 'notmalfunc' after the package installation. The use of base64 encoding and execution during setup strongly indicates obfuscation and malicious behavior, potentially to exfiltrate data or establish contact with malicious servers. The URL points to an IP address, which is suspicious in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by executing an obfuscated network request during package installation, likely for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or command and control. The use of base64 encoding and execution in setup scripts indicates malicious intent.",
