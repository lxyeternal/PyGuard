      "conclusion": "The provided scores are generally consistent with the analysis. Slight adjustments, such as increasing the malware suspicion in Report 2 to 0.4 and the risk in Report 1 to 0.5, would better align with the observed patterns. The overall assessment indicates moderate suspicion primarily driven by obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting cautious monitoring but no confirmed malicious activity."
