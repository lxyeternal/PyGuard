  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic code execution (eval/exec), environment variables, import statements, hardcoded secrets, input handling, data transmission, and obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Potential network communication, data exfiltration points, system modifications, or access to sensitive data via environment variables or hardcoded secrets.",
  "flows": "Input sources (untrusted data, environment variables) to sinks (network, file system, environment), often via eval/exec or dynamic imports, possibly hidden behind obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution with untrusted input, use of environment variables for secrets, inconsistent variable naming, and lack of explicit malicious payloads but suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "Reports 1 and 2 show high obfuscation and dynamic code execution, with Report 2 indicating eval/exec with untrusted input and environment variables, suggesting potential malicious intent. Scores for obfuscation (0.8 and 0.6) and malware suspicion (0.2 and 0.3) are justified but could be slightly adjusted for conservativeness. Reports 3 and 4 lack code, appropriately scored zero. Report 5 shows benign patterns with no obfuscation or malicious indicators, scored low risk. Overall, the suspicion is moderate, especially in reports 1 and 2, with scores reflecting the observed behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided scores are generally consistent with the analysis. Slight adjustments, such as increasing the malware suspicion in Report 2 to 0.4 and the risk in Report 1 to 0.5, would better align with the observed patterns. The overall assessment indicates moderate suspicion primarily driven by obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting cautious monitoring but no confirmed malicious activity.",
