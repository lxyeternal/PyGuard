  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard, legitimate implementation for establishing proxy connections asynchronously.\n- No suspicious code structures, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The main potential concern across reports is the handling of user-supplied 'proxy_url' and credentials, which could be exploited if maliciously crafted, but this is a common scenario in proxy handling and not inherently malicious.\n- The malware scores are all zero, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No issues found; code is standard, no malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned; no changes needed.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk (0.2), due to potential issues with untrusted proxy URLs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; the minor security risk reflects the unvalidated proxy URL input, but no malware.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion; standard implementation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; low risk due to user input but no malware.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar, with high confidence (0.9). Slightly more cautious about untrusted proxy URLs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Also standard, with similar risk considerations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scores:**\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) due to potential issues with untrusted proxy URLs, which is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n- The current scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's nature.\n- The highest risk factor is the handling of untrusted proxy URLs, which is already reflected in the small securityRisk scores.\n- No adjustments needed for malware or obfuscation scores.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** 0.15 (average of the small security risks, reflecting potential misuse of untrusted proxy URLs but not malicious intent)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate given the code's functionality and the potential, but not malicious, risks involved.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always recommend validating proxy URLs and credentials in production environments to mitigate risks associated with untrusted inputs.",
