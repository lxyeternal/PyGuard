{
  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous proxy connection functions using python_socks and asyncio, supporting SOCKS5 proxies with optional credentials.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parsing via parse_proxy_url; user-supplied host, port, username, password; asyncio event loop; proxy connection establishment.",
  "sinks": "Proxy connection socket; asyncio.open_connection or create_connection with socket parameter.",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url extracts proxy details from proxy_url -> Proxy.create creates proxy object -> proxy.connect establishes socket -> socket used in asyncio.open_connection or create_connection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. Handling of untrusted proxy_url could be exploited but is standard in proxy configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for establishing proxy connections asynchronously. It validates input parameters, parses proxy URLs, creates proxy objects, and connects sockets. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The main concern is the acceptance of user-controlled proxy URLs, which could be maliciously crafted, but this is a common operational risk rather than a flaw. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting potential misuse but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and secure for its purpose. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2. No adjustments needed. Always recommend validating proxy URLs in production to mitigate misuse risks.",
