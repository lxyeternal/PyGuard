  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\n- The code provides asynchronous functions to establish network connections via proxies, supporting SOCKS5 and customizable parameters.\n- It uses the `python_socks` library to parse proxy URLs, create proxy objects, and connect sockets.\n- The functions handle user input parameters, parse proxy URLs, and establish connections through proxies.\n- There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The code relies on standard libraries and third-party packages, with proper validation of input parameters.\n- The only potential concern is the acceptance of user-controlled proxy URLs, which could be maliciously crafted, but this is a common scenario in proxy handling.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard, legitimate implementation for proxy connections.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, appropriate scoring.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard behavior and proper handling.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, only potential concern about proxy URL manipulation, which is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n- **Justification for Security Risk:** Accepting untrusted proxy URLs can be risky, but it's a standard feature, not inherently malicious.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower (0.9), which is acceptable given the cautious stance.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Reiterates standard proxy connection handling.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, code obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n- **Justification:** Slightly lower security risk reflects the standard nature of the code and minimal concern about malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Focuses on standard implementation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, well-structured, and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n- **Note:** The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), which is reasonable given the reliance on user input.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Recognizes the code as standard for proxy connections.\n- **Findings:** Accepts unvalidated user input for proxy URLs, which could be exploited, but this is typical in such scenarios.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n- **Justification:** The potential risk from unvalidated input is acknowledged but not considered malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with malware = 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are justified based on the potential misuse of untrusted proxy URLs, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — accepting untrusted proxy URLs could be exploited, but this is standard in proxy handling and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The code appears safe and legitimate, with minimal security concern primarily related to input validation, which is a common trade-off.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured implementation for establishing proxy connections asynchronously. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
