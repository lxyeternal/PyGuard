  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of asynchronous proxy connection functions, using `python_socks` and `asyncio`.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present.\n- The functions parse proxy URLs, create proxy objects, and establish connections, which is standard behavior.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious network activity is detected.\n- The only potential concern is the handling of user-supplied proxy URLs, which could be maliciously crafted but is a common scenario in proxy handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and discrepancies:\n\n**Presence of issues in code:**  \n- The code matches the description; no anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident.  \n- No errors or flaws are reported or detected in the code logic.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score | Justification for high risk scores (>0.5) |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| 1       | 0         | 0            | 0            | No malware, no obfuscation, standard code behavior |\n| 2       | 0         | 0            | 0.2          | Slight concern about untrusted input but standard handling |\n| 3       | 0         | 0            | 0.1          | Similar to report 2, minimal risk from input handling |\n| 4       | 0         | 0            | 0.1          | Same reasoning, standard proxy connection code |\n| 5       | 0         | 0            | 0.2          | Slightly higher due to input handling but still benign |\n\n**Analysis of scores:**\n\n- Malware scores are correctly set to 0; no malicious activity detected.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting the potential for misuse if proxy URLs are maliciously crafted, but this is a common risk in proxy configurations, not specific to malicious code.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- The risk scores could be slightly increased to 0.3 for reports 2 and 5, considering that accepting untrusted proxy URLs can pose security risks (e.g., man-in-the-middle proxies, malicious proxies).  \n- However, since the code itself is standard and does not perform any malicious actions, the current scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as no malicious behavior is detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0, code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** Should remain low, around 0.1–0.3, reflecting potential issues with untrusted proxy URLs but not malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1–0.2 |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is standard, uses well-known libraries, and performs expected functions.  \n- No malware or obfuscation is present.  \n- The main concern is the handling of user-supplied proxy URLs, which could be exploited if malicious proxies are used, but this is a typical operational risk rather than a code flaw.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe current report scores are appropriate given the evidence. No significant changes are necessary. The overall security posture of this code is benign, with the caveat that untrusted proxy URLs should be validated or sanitized in a real-world deployment to mitigate potential misuse.\n\n---",
