  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of proxy connectors for aiohttp, supporting SOCKS and chained proxies. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score reflects potential misuse if untrusted proxy URLs are supplied, but this is an operational concern rather than a code vulnerability. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's benign nature."
