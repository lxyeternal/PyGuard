  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module that imports classes/functions from external and internal modules and then defines `__all__` for exports.\n- No reports mention any input handling, data processing, network operations, or code execution beyond imports/exports.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code is standard for a Python package's `__init__.py` or module setup file.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The reports correctly identify that the code only handles imports and exports, with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Scores assigned by reports?**  \n  All reports give malware and security risk scores of 0, which seems appropriate. Since the code is purely for module setup, this is justified.\n\n- **Risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  No. All are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Malware score?**  \n  All reports assign malware score 0, which is correct given the code's nature.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on observable code behavior.\n\n- **Score consistency?**  \n  Yes. The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard module initialization file with no malicious or security issues.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- No modifications needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n  The code contains no malicious payloads or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n  The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0  \n  No security risks are present.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is benign, serving as a module interface for a proxy library. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the actual security posture.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that such module setup files are not modified to include hidden code, but based on the provided snippet and reports, this code is safe.",
