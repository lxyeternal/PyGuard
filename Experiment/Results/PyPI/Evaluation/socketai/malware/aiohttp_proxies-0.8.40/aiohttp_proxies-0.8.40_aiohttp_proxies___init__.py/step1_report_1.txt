{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports modules and classes related to SOCKS proxy support for aiohttp, including utilities and deprecated features.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'python_socks' and relative module imports from local files (_deprecated, connector, utils). No external input handling detected.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code primarily imports and re-exports classes and functions, without processing untrusted data or executing commands.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up namespace exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution is present. The code consists of module imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific classes and functions from external and internal modules and then defines '__all__' for module exports. It serves as an index or interface module, with no input handling, data processing, or executable logic that could pose security risks. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or secret leakages. All elements appear standard for a library setup file.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module definition file that exports relevant classes and functions for SOCKS proxy support in aiohttp. It shows no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities.",
