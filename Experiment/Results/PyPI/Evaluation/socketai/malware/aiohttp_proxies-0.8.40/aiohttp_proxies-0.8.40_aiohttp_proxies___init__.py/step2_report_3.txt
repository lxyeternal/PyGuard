  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports consistently describe this code as a straightforward module that imports and re-exports classes/functions related to SOCKS proxy support.\n- No input handling, data processing, network operations, or execution of untrusted code is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.\n- The presence of deprecated modules is noted but not malicious—just a maintenance concern.\n- The code appears to be a typical package index or module setup file.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the lack of any security concerns.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- No issues are detected; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n- Since the code is purely about module exports and imports, and no malicious or risky behavior is detected, I agree with the assigned scores.\n- The only minor note is the deprecated modules, which could be flagged for maintenance but not security.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, benign module setup for a Python proxy library. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
