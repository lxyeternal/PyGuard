{
  "purpose": "This code defines module metadata, imports classes and functions related to proxy handling, and sets export variables for an aiohttp socks proxy package.",
  "sources": "Imports from python_socks and internal module files (_deprecated, utils, connector). No input reading or data input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data output points; the code primarily imports and re-exports components.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code consists solely of imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. The use of deprecated modules is noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package metadata and organizes imports/exports. It imports proxy-related classes and functions, including deprecated ones. No data processing, input handling, or network operations are present. No signs of malicious behavior, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code injection. The presence of deprecated modules suggests maintenance concerns but not malicious intent. No external data sources or sinks are invoked. Overall, the code appears safe and standard for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a typical package index file for an aiohttp socks proxy package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It mainly manages module exports and imports without any suspicious activity.",
