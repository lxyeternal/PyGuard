  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module index file, importing classes/functions from 'python_socks' and local modules, then exporting them via `__all__`.\n- No input handling, data processing, network operations, or command execution is present.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are identified.\n- The presence of deprecated modules is noted but considered a maintenance concern, not malicious.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any actual logic, data flows, or data sinks involving untrusted sources.\n- The purpose is purely to define and export symbols for a library, with no indication of malicious intent.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or signs of obfuscation are detected.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware: consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Security risk: 0, since the code doesn't process or handle data that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n- Risk score: all reports give 0 or very low, which is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code appears entirely benign.\n- No changes needed in the scoring.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware score: **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- Obfuscated score: **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- Risk score: **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis module is a typical package setup file that only manages imports and exports. There are no security concerns here.",
