{
  "purpose": "Defines a deprecated SocksConnector class for proxy handling, along with related proxy error classes and version constants.",
  "sources": "Imports from warnings, python_socks, and local connector module; class methods and functions that invoke warnings and create proxy objects.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or potentially harmful operations observed.",
  "flows": "Uses warnings during class initialization and method calls; does not process untrusted input into security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecation warning suggests outdated code; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious dynamic code; straightforward class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code defines proxy version constants, issues deprecation warnings for the SocksConnector class, and delegates functionality to a superclass ProxyConnector. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or execute untrusted input directly. The code appears to be standard class inheritance and warning usage without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware are present. The only notable aspect is deprecation warning, which indicates the class is outdated but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious deprecation wrapper for proxy configuration with no signs of malware or security risks. It primarily issues warnings and delegates functionality. Overall, it is safe with a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
