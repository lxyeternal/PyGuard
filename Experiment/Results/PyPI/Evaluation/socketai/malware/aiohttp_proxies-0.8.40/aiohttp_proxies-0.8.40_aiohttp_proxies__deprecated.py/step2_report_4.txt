  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code to determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of the scores, and whether any malicious or security issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- Defines SOCKS version constants.\n- Implements a deprecated `SocksConnector` class inheriting from `ProxyConnector`.\n- Issues deprecation warnings when `SocksConnector` is instantiated or used via `from_url`.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The code is primarily for proxy configuration, with clear, straightforward logic.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Defines a SocksConnector with deprecation warnings.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior; straightforward code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign, with no security issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly rated; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1; deprecation wrapper.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; standard warnings.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate scores; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above; deprecation wrapper.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code; straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No security issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar; deprecation wrapper with class inheritance.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; good deprecation practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Defines SOCKS proxy class with deprecation warning.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior; standard class inheritance and warnings.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** The reports assign a very low risk (~0.1 or 0), which is appropriate given the code's purpose and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Justification\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected.\n- **Use of assumptions:** The reports do not assume malicious intent; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Scores consistency:** The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, mainly due to deprecation warnings, which are standard practice.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a simple, well-structured proxy configuration wrapper with deprecation warnings. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores across reports are appropriate and justified.",
