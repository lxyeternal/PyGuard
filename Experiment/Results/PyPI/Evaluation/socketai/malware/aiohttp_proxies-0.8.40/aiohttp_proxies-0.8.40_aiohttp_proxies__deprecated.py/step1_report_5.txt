{
  "purpose": "This code defines a SocksConnector class that facilitates proxy connections using SOCKS4 or SOCKS5 protocols, including deprecation warnings for an older connector class.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from import statements and the constructor parameters such as 'socks_ver' and '**kwargs'. It also reads the URL input in the from_url method.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the 'from_url' method which processes a URL input, possibly affecting network configuration if misused. The warning function may be triggered based on code usage.",
  "flows": "Input URL flows through the from_url class method into the parent class. Constructor parameters ('socks_ver' and 'kwargs') influence the creation of the superclass instance. The deprecated warning is triggered during instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. It primarily involves class inheritance and deprecation warnings, which are standard. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for proxy handling and warnings. It defines a class for SOCKS proxy configuration, with an explicit deprecation warning to guide users to a new class. The constructor manages proxy type setup based on arguments. The from_url class method allows creating instances from URLs. There are no signs of malicious code or suspicious behavior. The warning indicates a transition from an old class to a new one, which is a common practice.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of a proxy connector with deprecation notices. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code is straightforward, serving a typical purpose in network configuration management.",
