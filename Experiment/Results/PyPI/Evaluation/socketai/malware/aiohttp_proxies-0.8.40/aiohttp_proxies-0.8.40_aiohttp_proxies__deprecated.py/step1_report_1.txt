{
  "purpose": "Define a SocksConnector class that wraps around a ProxyConnector, providing support for SOCKS proxy types and deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as 'socks_ver' and 'url', as well as from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sensitive sinks or data leaks. It primarily sets up class inheritance and warnings.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (socks_ver, url) are used to initialize or create instances of SocksConnector; no untrusted data flow to sensitive operations is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a deprecation warning indicating that SocksConnector is deprecated, but no malicious or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code appears to be straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The script defines constants for SOCKS versions, a deprecation warning function, and a class SocksConnector inheriting from ProxyConnector. The class constructor and from_url method issue warnings and initialize the parent class with appropriate parameters. No hardcoded credentials, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code is primarily concerned with proxy configuration and deprecation messaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard proxy setup with deprecation notices; there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It serves as a wrapper around existing proxy functionality without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
