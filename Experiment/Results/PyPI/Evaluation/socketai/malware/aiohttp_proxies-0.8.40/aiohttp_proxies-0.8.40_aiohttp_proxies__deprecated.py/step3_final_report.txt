{
  "purpose": "Defines SOCKS version constants and implements a deprecated SocksConnector class that delegates to ProxyConnector, issuing deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Class initialization parameters, from_url method, and the warnings.warn calls.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or network operations; primarily warnings and superclass method calls.",
  "flows": "Initialization and from_url method invoke superclass methods; warnings.warn is called during class usage.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecation warnings; no malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple wrapper around an existing proxy connector class, issuing deprecation warnings when used. It defines constants for SOCKS versions, supports initialization via parameters or URL, and delegates to the parent class. No suspicious behaviors, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The deprecation warning is standard practice and does not introduce security risks. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate given the code's clarity. The security risk score of 0.1 is justified but could be slightly lowered, as the deprecation warning itself does not pose a security threat. Overall, the code is benign and serves as a wrapper for proxy configuration with deprecation notices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured deprecation wrapper around a proxy connector class. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
