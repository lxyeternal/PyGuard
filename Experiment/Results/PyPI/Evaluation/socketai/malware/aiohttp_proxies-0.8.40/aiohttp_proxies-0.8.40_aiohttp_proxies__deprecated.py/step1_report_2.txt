{
  "purpose": "Defines a deprecated SocksConnector class for handling SOCKS proxy connections, with warnings for deprecation and support for different SOCKS versions.",
  "sources": "import warnings, python_socks (ProxyError, ProxyConnectionError, ProxyType), and local module .connector (ProxyConnector).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily initializes objects and issues warnings.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of SocksConnector (possibly with URL); warning issued; calls to superclass methods for initialization and URL parsing.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated class with warnings, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for proxy handling, issues a deprecation warning when SocksConnector is used, and initializes the class with options for SOCKS4 or SOCKS5. The from_url class method delegates to the superclass. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward and maintains good practice in warning about deprecated features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of a proxy connector with deprecation warnings. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It appears safe for use within the intended scope.",
