{
  "purpose": "Defines a deprecated SOCKS proxy connector class that extends a generic ProxyConnector, with utility functions and error aliasing.",
  "sources": "Imports warnings, exceptions from python_socks, and a local connector module; class definitions and functions that may be called externally.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code mainly defines classes and functions without executing external commands or processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Constructor and class method invoke superclass methods; no untrusted data flows or external input handling evident.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a deprecation warning to inform about a deprecated class; no suspicious or malicious code such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages class inheritance, deprecation warnings, and error aliasing. It does not process untrusted input, perform network actions, or execute suspicious commands. The warnings indicate a transition from SocksConnector to ProxyConnector, aligning with good deprecation practices. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured deprecation wrapper around a proxy connector class. No malicious intent or security risks are present. The code serves to inform users of the deprecation and redirect them to the new class implementation.",
