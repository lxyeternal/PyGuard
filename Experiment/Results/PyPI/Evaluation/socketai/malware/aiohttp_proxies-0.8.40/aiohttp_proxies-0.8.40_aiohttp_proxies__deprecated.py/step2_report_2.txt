  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of their assessments and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily a wrapper around an existing proxy class (`ProxyConnector`) with deprecation warnings.\n- No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The deprecation warnings suggest the class is outdated but not malicious.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious network activity.\n- The logic is straightforward: class inheritance, warnings, and delegation.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurate; the code defines constants, a deprecation warning, and a class that delegates to a superclass.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, justified given the deprecation warning and no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correct; emphasizes deprecation warning and straightforward class inheritance.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correct; highlights the deprecation warning and standard class structure.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-founded assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correct; describes the class as a deprecation wrapper with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correct; recognizes the code as a standard deprecation wrapper with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, assigning a malware score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the deprecation warnings and lack of malicious activity, a low risk score (~0.1) is justified. Some reports assign 0.1, which seems reasonable; others assign 0, which is also acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, with no obfuscation or security issues.\n- The deprecation warning indicates the code is outdated but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, justified by deprecation and potential for outdated usage but no security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and well-justified. No adjustments needed. The code is a standard, non-malicious deprecation wrapper around a proxy connector class.",
