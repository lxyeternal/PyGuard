      "conclusion": "The code contains high-risk indicators of malicious activity, primarily due to obfuscated external code execution during package installation, suspicious URL, and error concealment. The assigned scores are appropriate; further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious intent. Overall, the package should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious until proven otherwise."
