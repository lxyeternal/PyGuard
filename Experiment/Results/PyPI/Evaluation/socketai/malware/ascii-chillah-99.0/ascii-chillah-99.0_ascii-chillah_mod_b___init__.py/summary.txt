  "security_risk": 0.45,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits potential risk primarily due to eval() and obfuscation patterns but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. Adjusting malware scores for reports 2 and 3 upward reflects the red flags. The overall assessment remains cautious but reasonable, emphasizing the need for further code review if possible."
