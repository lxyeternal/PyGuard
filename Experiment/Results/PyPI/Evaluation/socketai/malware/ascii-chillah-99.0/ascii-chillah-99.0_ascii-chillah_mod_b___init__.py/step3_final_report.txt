  "purpose": "Analysis of Python code for potential malicious behavior, focusing on supply chain risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns such as eval() usage.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data, uses eval(), variable assignments, and possibly network or environment interactions.",
  "sinks": "eval() execution, data output, potential network connections, or data leaks via eval() or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input data or untrusted sources reach eval() or dynamic execution points, which could lead to malicious code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval() with no clear context, obscure variable names, inconsistent obfuscation levels, and lack of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The reports identify eval() as a red flag but generally do not confirm malicious activity. Report 2 and 3 mention eval() and obfuscation, warranting higher malware scores. Report 2's malware score should be increased from 0.2 to approximately 0.4 to reflect potential risk. Report 3's malware score can be slightly increased from 0 to about 0.2–0.3 due to eval() usage. Other reports are consistent with benign code. Obfuscation scores are justified where eval() and obscure variables are present. Overall, the security risk scores are moderate, aligning with the suspicion level but no confirmed malicious activity. Confidence levels are appropriate based on available evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits potential risk primarily due to eval() and obfuscation patterns but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. Adjusting malware scores for reports 2 and 3 upward reflects the red flags. The overall assessment remains cautious but reasonable, emphasizing the need for further code review if possible.",
