  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates behaviors consistent with a high-risk, potentially malicious component designed for covert system fingerprinting, data exfiltration, and supply chain abuse. While it lacks explicit payloads like reverse shells, its capacity for stealth, exfiltration, and package manipulation warrants serious concern. It should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious until further analysis confirms its intent."
