  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints a static message, serving as a demonstration or placeholder.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or data reads; the code is self-contained.",
  "sinks": "The print statement is a benign output sink with no security implications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources; the function executes a static print command.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single, simple function that outputs a fixed message. All five reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no external data handling, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are consistent with the analysis. The confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty in the benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code's simplicity supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward function with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate and consistent, and the scoring appropriately reflects the benign nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
