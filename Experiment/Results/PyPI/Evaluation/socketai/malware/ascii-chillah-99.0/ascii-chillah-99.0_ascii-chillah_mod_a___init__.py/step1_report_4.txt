  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs a specific task, but without additional context, the purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user input functions, or data files (if any are present in the code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication, file writing, or executing system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., user input or environment variables) to sinks via variables or function calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs detected. The code uses common Python features.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code shows typical structure and usage without signs of malicious intent. No suspicious network connections, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code does not execute dynamic code, nor does it contain obfuscated or misleading variable names. It adheres to standard coding practices. Without specific input or external context, no malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or malware. It appears to be a benign, standard Python script. However, as the code content is minimal and lacks context, a low confidence level is assigned. No immediate security threats are evident.",
