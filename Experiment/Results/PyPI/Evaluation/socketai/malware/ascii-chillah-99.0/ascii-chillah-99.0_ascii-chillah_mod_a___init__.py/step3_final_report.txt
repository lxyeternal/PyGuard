  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variables, network connections, file operations",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writes, environment variable access, data output",
  "flows": "Sources such as input functions or environment variables to sinks like network sockets or file writes",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious network activity; minimal code content",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the lack of code or benign code snippets, with appropriate reasoning. Scores for malware and obfuscation are zero across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators. Risk scores are slightly above zero (0.2), reflecting minimal residual uncertainty due to incomplete or minimal code, but no evidence of malicious intent. Confidence levels are reasonable given the limited information. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The reasoning is consistent, and the scores are justified based on the provided analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate considering the limited context. Overall, the reports are consistent and justified; no adjustments are necessary.",
