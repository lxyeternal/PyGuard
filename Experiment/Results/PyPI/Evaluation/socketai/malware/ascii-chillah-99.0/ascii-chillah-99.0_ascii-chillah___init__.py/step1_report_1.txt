  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without explicit comments or documentation, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and possibly from user inputs or external sources via function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (if present), file operations, or data outputs, but these are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input functions through processing functions to output or external connections. Specific source-to-sink flows cannot be precisely identified without more code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious function calls are detected. The code uses standard Python features and libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for common security issues, including hardcoded secrets, unsafe data handling, and suspicious network activity. No such issues are observed. The overall structure suggests standard utility or processing functions. Without additional context or external calls, there are no signs of malicious intent. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors were identified. The code appears benign based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to be a normal, functional piece of code with no evident security concerns.",
