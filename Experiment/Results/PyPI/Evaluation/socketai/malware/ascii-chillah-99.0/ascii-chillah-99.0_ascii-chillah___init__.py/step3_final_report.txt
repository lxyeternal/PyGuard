  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign utility or data processing script with no malicious indicators.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, command line arguments, or input data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs to console, files, or network, but no suspicious sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input sources to outputs or processing functions, with no evidence of malicious data exfiltration or manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores reflect a low security risk and no malware presence. Given the absence of code snippets, the assessment relies on descriptions, which indicate benign intent. The confidence score is high due to the consistency of the reasoning. No anomalies or suspicious flows are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The supply chain security risk is minimal. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate and conservative.",
