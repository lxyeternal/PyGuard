  "purpose": "A simple function that prints a message indicating it is 'function_b'.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No output sinks or data leak points detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified; function only prints a static message.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function 'function_b' that, when called, outputs a static string. There are no inputs, no external dependencies, no data processing, and no control flow complexity. The code appears straightforward and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs a simple print operation. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
