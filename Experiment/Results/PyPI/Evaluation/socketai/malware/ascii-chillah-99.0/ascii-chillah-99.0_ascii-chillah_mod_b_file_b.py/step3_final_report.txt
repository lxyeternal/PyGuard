{
  "purpose": "To evaluate the security posture of a simple Python function and determine if it exhibits malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "The function definition itself, which reads no external data, inputs, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code only prints a static message.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function executes a print statement with a hardcoded string, with no external data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that outputs a static string. No inputs, external data, network activity, or complex logic are involved. All reports confirm the benign nature, with high confidence scores and no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The assessments are consistent and accurate, with no unsupported assumptions or overlooked issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities detected. The reports' scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
