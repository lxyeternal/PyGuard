  "purpose": "Implement a customizable proxy connector supporting various proxy types and DNS resolution options for aiohttp.",
  "sources": "Parameters for proxy type, host, port, username, password; URL parsing via parse_proxy_url; socket creation via create_socket_wrapper.",
  "sinks": "Proxy URL construction (potential credential exposure if logged); socket connection establishment.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> proxy_url property (formats URL) -> socket creation in _wrap_create_connection -> connection request in connect method.",
  "anomalies": "Use of NoResolver to bypass DNS; proxy credentials embedded in URL; external helper functions (create_socket_wrapper, parse_proxy_url) assumed secure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a proxy connector with dynamic URL formation, socket wrapping, and optional DNS resolution. No malicious or suspicious code is present. Proxy credentials are handled via parameters and URL formatting, which is typical but should be managed securely to prevent leaks. The use of create_socket_wrapper and NoResolver appears legitimate. No obfuscation or backdoors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior, with minor risk due to credential handling but no active vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured proxy connector with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects standard proxy handling practices, with a minor concern about credential exposure if logs are insecure. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
