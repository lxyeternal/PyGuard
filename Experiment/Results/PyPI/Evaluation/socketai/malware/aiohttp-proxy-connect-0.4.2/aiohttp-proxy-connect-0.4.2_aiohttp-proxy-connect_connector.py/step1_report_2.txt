{
  "purpose": "Implement a customizable proxy connector for aiohttp with support for different proxy types and no resolver.",
  "sources": "The code reads proxy configuration data from class properties and URL parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs proxy URLs, socket wrappers, and performs network connections; potential untrusted data flows into network communication.",
  "flows": "Proxy configuration data (host, port, username, password) -> proxy_url property -> create_socket_wrapper and network connection methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns observed. Proxy URL is dynamically generated, which is standard. No obfuscated code or hidden logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for custom DNS resolution and proxy connection handling. Proxy details are supplied via constructor or from URL parsing, then used to construct proxy URLs and network sockets. The socket wrapper and connection methods appear to facilitate network connections through proxies, with support for different proxy types. No data leaks, no suspicious data handling, and no code that appears malicious. The code relies on external helper functions and modules, but their use appears straightforward and appropriate for proxy handling. No malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration or backdoors, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements legitimate proxy connection functionality with no signs of malicious intent. It securely handles proxy configuration and network connections without suspicious activity. Overall, it appears safe.",
