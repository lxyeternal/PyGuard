{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package and, if run with specific arguments, attempts to send device and directory data via a Telegram bot.",
  "sources": "Reading package version from __init__.py, reading README.md, importing modules, accessing system arguments, reading directory contents, reading files for photos.",
  "sinks": "Telegram bot API calls that send messages and photos, especially sensitive directory listings and files from device storage.",
  "flows": "Version extraction and package setup -> Conditional execution based on sys.argv -> Importing telebot and sending device info and photos to a hardcoded chat ID.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat IDs, sending potentially sensitive device data without user consent, accessing device storage directories typically unavailable to standard Python scripts outside Android environment.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks for a Python package, including version retrieval and dependency specification. However, the malicious activity occurs when the script is executed with specific command-line arguments ('install' or 'bdist'), triggering a Telegram bot to send device data. It uses a hardcoded token and chat ID to exfiltrate device files, including photos from an Android device's camera directory, which indicates malicious intent. This activity appears to be covert data exfiltration disguised within a setup script, exploiting package installation routines. The code accesses sensitive directories and sends data without user consent, constituting malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, specifically exfiltrating device files via Telegram using hardcoded credentials, embedded within a package setup script. This suggests intentional data theft or espionage activities, with a high malware score and security risk. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious.",
