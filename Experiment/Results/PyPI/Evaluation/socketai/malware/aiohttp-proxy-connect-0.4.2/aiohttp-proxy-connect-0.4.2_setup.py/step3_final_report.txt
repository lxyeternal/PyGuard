{
  "purpose": "Embedded malicious code in the setup script exfiltrates device data via Telegram using hardcoded credentials, accessing Android directories and sending personal files and images without user consent.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from __init__.py, accessing Android device directories (/storage/emulated/0/, /storage/emulated/0/DCIM/), importing telebot and creating a bot instance with hardcoded token.",
  "sinks": "Sending messages, directory listings, and photos to a specific Telegram chat ID, potentially leaking sensitive user data.",
  "flows": "Code reads device directories -> constructs messages and photos -> sends data via telebot to external Telegram chat ID.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, access to Android-specific directories, data exfiltration during package setup, broad try-except masking errors, no obfuscation techniques used.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks but contains embedded malicious activity involving data exfiltration via Telegram. It accesses sensitive device directories and sends personal files and images without user consent. The malicious block is wrapped in broad exception handling, indicating an attempt to hide errors. The activity is explicit and active, with no obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9-1, security risk ~0.9-1, obfuscation 0) are justified. Given the direct exfiltration of personal data and hardcoded credentials, the malware and security risk scores should be set to 1.0. The code's straightforward nature confirms no obfuscation. Overall, the code demonstrates high malicious intent and poses a severe security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains embedded malicious behavior involving unauthorized data exfiltration via Telegram with hardcoded credentials, accessing Android device directories, and sending personal files and images. The activity is explicit, active, and highly dangerous. The scores should be set to maximum (malware 1.0, security risk 1.0, obfuscation 0), reflecting the severity of the malicious activity.",
