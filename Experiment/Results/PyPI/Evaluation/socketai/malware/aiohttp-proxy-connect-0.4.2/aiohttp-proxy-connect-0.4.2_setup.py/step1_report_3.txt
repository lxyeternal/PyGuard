  "purpose": "Setup and dependency management for the aiohttp-proxy-connect package, with additional code for Telegram bot communication and file access.",
  "sources": "Reading package version from __init__.py, importing setup tools, reading README.md, accessing system files at /storage/emulated/0/ and subdirectories.",
  "sinks": "Telegram bot API calls that send messages and photos, potentially transmitting sensitive user data.",
  "flows": "Version extraction from __init__.py -> Sending system directory listings and photos via Telegram bot.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token ('5386522594:AAE300GqEw3NzA2-exL8htYrq0IpkxAHLOE') and chat ID ('5002945735') in the code, access to sensitive storage paths (/storage/emulated/0/), unconditioned access to device files, no obfuscation, and potential privacy invasion.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard setup tasks such as reading dependencies and package information. However, it contains a significant malicious component: a Telegram bot is hardcoded with credentials, which sends messages and photos from device storage. This activity occurs unconditionally during certain setup command invocations, indicating an attempt to exfiltrate device data. The bot communications include listing directory contents and sending images, which could leak sensitive information. The presence of hardcoded credentials and access to device-specific directories strongly suggests malicious intent or at least privacy violations. There are no obfuscation techniques or unusual code structures; the malicious behavior is straightforward but clearly unauthorized and potentially harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious activity, notably exfiltration of device data via a Telegram bot with hardcoded credentials. The setup process is standard, but the added code poses a privacy and security risk. The overall security risk score is high due to the clear data exfiltration, and the malware likelihood is also high.",
