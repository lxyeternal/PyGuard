{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be part of a proxy connection library, providing classes and functions to establish and handle proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, and .proto, which are likely local modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked; no external network communication, file writing, or data processing of untrusted input is shown.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports functions and classes; there are no dynamic data flows, input handling, or data processing flows depicted in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual code structures are present. The code is straightforward, mainly defining exports and importing modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules and components, defines a version string, and specifies exports. There is no evidence of data input handling, network communication, or data processing that could introduce security risks or malicious behavior. It functions as an initial setup or module export file, with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module setup for a proxy connection library, with no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. It appears to be a benign, structural part of a larger package.",
