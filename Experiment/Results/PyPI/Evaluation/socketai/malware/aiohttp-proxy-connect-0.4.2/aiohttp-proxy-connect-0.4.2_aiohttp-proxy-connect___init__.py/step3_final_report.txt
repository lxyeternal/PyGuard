  "purpose": "Module initialization and export setup for a proxy library, importing components from local modules and exposing them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "Importing components and defining __all__; no data flow or external data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward and standard for a Python package __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup, importing classes and functions from local modules and defining __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's structure and content are typical for a package initializer, with no signs of security issues or malware. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
