{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports components related to a SOCKS proxy connector, including error handling, connection helpers, and proxy type definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from relative paths: connector, errors, helpers, and proto; these are local module imports.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external output; purely defining and exporting classes, functions, and constants.",
  "flows": "The code imports components and then exposes selected elements via __all__, with no data flow or execution logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present; the version string is standard, and imports appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, version declaration, and __all__ exports. It does not process any input, execute logic, or include data flows. All components seem to be part of a proxy library, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module initialization file that imports and re-exports components for a proxy library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears safe.",
