  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward module setup, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The confidence is high, and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the code as a typical __init__.py file, with no dynamic logic or data flow, and no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is just importing and exporting components, with no data processing or external interactions. The conclusion aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Verdict:** Correct; no concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes the absence of input handling, data flow, or malicious patterns. The code is standard for a module interface.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate; no issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is a typical setup for a proxy library, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Valid; the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports agree that the code is benign, primarily import/export setup.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None detected. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** All malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk justification:** Since the code is purely structural, with no dynamic or external operations, the risk scores are correctly low.\n- **Malware score:** Zero, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Assumptions:** The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as a benign module setup.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe module initialization script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
