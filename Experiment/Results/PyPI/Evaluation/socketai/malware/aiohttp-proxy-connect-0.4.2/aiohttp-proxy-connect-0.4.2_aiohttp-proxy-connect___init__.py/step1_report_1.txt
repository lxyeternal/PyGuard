{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be part of a proxy client library, providing classes, functions, and error definitions related to SOCKS proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), and setting __version__ and __all__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; the code primarily imports and exports components.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks within this snippet; it mostly sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. The code strictly defines imports and module exports without any dynamic or risky operations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements from local modules, version declaration, and __all__ exports. There are no input reading sources such as network, environment variables, or user input. The code does not contain any sink functions or data processing. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or potentially malicious behaviors are evident. It functions as a typical module initialization script, establishing exports for a proxy library.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign module setup for a proxy library, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It simply imports and exposes components for use elsewhere.",
