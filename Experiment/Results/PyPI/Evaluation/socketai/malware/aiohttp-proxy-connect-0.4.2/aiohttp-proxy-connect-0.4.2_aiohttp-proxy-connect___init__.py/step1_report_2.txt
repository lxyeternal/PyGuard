{
  "purpose": "This module appears to define and export classes, errors, and helper functions related to a proxy connection system, specifically SOCKS proxy handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system calls; only module imports and exports.",
  "flows": "Imports and exports are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, data flow analysis indicates no untrusted data input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious function calls or unusual constructs. The code structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a set of import statements and an __all__ declaration, exposing specific classes and functions from local modules. No data is read from or written to external sources, nor is there any dynamic or reflective code. No embedded or malicious logic is present. The structure suggests this is an initialization or package definition file, not containing executable logic that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package __init__.py file used for module organization and export. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply re-exports components of the package for external use.",
