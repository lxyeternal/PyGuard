{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an importable module defining proxy connection components, error classes, and helper functions for a proxy handling library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; module primarily defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard module import and export statements with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules and defines a module version. It then exposes these via __all__ for external use. No user input handling, network operations, or data processing is present. The structure and content are typical for a Python package interface. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python module practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module defining proxies, errors, and helper functions for a network library. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation within this snippet.",
