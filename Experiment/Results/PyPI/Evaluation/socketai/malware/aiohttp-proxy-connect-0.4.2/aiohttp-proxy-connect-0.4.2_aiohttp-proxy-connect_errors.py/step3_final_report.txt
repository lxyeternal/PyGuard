  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions; no input or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class inheritance without execution or data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from standard exceptions. There are no input sources, data processing, network activity, or embedded logic. The code is clear, simple, and serves as a utility module. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the risk score is also 0, reflecting the harmless nature of the code. No discrepancies or flaws are present in the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's characteristics, and no further action is necessary.",
