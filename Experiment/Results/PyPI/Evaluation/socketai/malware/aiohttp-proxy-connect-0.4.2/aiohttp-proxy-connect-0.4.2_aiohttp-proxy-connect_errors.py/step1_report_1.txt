{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow involving untrusted data; only class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various exceptions used in SOCKS proxy operations. There are no input handling, data processing, or external communications. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or security risks are evident. The classes inherit from standard exceptions, and their purpose appears to be structured error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling in SOCKS proxy operations. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and poses no security risks.",
