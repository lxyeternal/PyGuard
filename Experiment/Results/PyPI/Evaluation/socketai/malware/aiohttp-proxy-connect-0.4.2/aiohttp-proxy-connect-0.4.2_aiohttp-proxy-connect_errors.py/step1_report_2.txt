  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurring.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are simple exception subclasses with no additional logic, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a set of exception classes for SOCKS and proxy errors. It includes no data input, output, or handling. All classes inherit from standard exception types, and there are no suspicious operations, dynamic code execution, or embedded data. The structure is straightforward and consistent with typical error class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard set of custom exception classes for a SOCKS proxy implementation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is purely structural with no evident threats.",
