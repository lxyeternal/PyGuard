  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code provided is a set of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - All reports confirm that there are no input handling, data processing, network activity, or other dynamic behaviors.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is purely structural, defining exception classes, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code contains only class definitions, with no logic or data handling.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1, which is justified because the analysis is straightforward and conclusive.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports and the code itself show no malicious or risky behavior, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - No suspicious behavior or code patterns are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward observation; no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n   - The reports correctly state that the code is harmless.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a simple, standard set of exception class definitions.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The code is benign, and no further action is needed beyond confirming its harmless nature.",
