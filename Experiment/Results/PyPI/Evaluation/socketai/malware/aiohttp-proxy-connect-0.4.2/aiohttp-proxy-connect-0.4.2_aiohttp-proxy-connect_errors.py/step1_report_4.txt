  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy and connection errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; exception class definitions do not read data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no data flows to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only defines exception classes without any data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions inheriting from built-in exception classes. There are no data inputs, no data processing, no network interactions, nor any logic that could be exploited maliciously. The classes are named appropriately for their purpose, serving as custom exceptions for SOCKS errors and connection issues. The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior or hidden code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions used for error handling in SOCKS proxy operations. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks.",
