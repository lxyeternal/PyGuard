  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as only defining exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No input/output, data processing, network activity, or external interactions are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- The code is straightforward, inheriting from standard exceptions, serving as a utility module for error handling.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Code Content:\n- The code matches the descriptions in all reports: only class definitions, no logic or data handling.\n- No discrepancies or missing elements are apparent.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No flawed reasoning or overlooked issues are evident.\n- The conclusion that the code is benign and purely structural is justified.\n\n### Scores and Their Reasonableness:\n- **Malware Score (0):** Correct, as no malicious activity is suggested.\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** Correct, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score (0):** Appropriate, as no security risk or vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since the code only defines exception classes without any logic, data handling, or external communication, the risk score should remain at 0.\n- No reason exists to assign a higher score, given the absence of any suspicious or malicious activity.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made, and none are warranted.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n- The detailed reasoning supports the conclusion that the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors. It contains no logic, data handling, or network activity that could be malicious or risky.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect its harmless nature.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's characteristics.",
