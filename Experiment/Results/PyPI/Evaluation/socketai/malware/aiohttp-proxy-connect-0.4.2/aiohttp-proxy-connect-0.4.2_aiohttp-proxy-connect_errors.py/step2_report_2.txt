  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no input handling, data processing, network communication, or any executable logic. Therefore, the code is purely structural and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware score: 0  \n   - Obfuscated score: 0  \n   - Security risk: 0  \n   - Confidence: 1\n\n   These scores seem appropriate given the nature of the code. Since the code is just class definitions, there's no basis for higher malware or obfuscation scores.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   The risk scores are all zero, which aligns with the analysis that the code is benign. No justification is needed for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports, as there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They focus solely on the code provided, which is safe and standard.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risk present.\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for error handling in SOCKS proxy operations. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are thorough and accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**In conclusion**, I agree with the reports' assessments and scores. The code is safe, clear, and serves a structural purpose within a larger application.",
