  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - No input/output, data processing, network activity, or executable logic is present.\n   - All classes inherit from standard exceptions and contain no additional code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is purely structural, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the summaries; they are consistent and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which is justified due to the straightforward, well-understood nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes, there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct.\n   - No suspicious patterns or embedded malicious code are present.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly concluding that the code is benign.\n   - The reasoning is sound and based on the code's simplicity and lack of executable logic.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - Given the code's nature, no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- There are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that appropriately.",
