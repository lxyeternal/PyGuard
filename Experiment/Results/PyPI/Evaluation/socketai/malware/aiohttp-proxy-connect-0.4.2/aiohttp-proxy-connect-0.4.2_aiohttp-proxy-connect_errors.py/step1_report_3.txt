  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SOCKS proxy operations and connection issues.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines exception classes without reading input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flows or logic execution beyond class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions without any unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The provided code only defines a set of custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. There are no input sources, no data processing, no network activity, and no security-sensitive operations. The classes are straightforward and do not contain any executable code, malicious or otherwise. The absence of code logic, data handling, or external interactions indicates no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The code appears to serve as a foundation for error handling within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception class definitions for handling SOCKS proxy and connection errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activities, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, utility-focused module.",
