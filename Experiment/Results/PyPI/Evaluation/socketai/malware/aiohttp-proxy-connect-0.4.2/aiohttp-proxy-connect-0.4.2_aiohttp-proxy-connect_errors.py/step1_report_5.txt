{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; just class definitions for exceptions",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow; only exception class declarations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from built-in exception classes. No logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. The classes are standard for handling SOCKS proxy errors and do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious patterns. This appears to be a straightforward definition of exception classes for error handling within a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely defining custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks.",
