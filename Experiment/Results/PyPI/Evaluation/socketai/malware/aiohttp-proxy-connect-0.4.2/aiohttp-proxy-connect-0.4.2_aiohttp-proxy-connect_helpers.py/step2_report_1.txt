  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to identify any inconsistencies, potential issues, or signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard implementation for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously.\n- They highlight that the code parses proxy URLs, creates socket wrappers, and connects to target hosts.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are detected.\n- The main concern revolves around the use of untrusted proxy URLs, which could lead to data leakage if URLs are malicious, but this is standard behavior and not inherently malicious.\n- All reports assign a high confidence (0.9), with malware scores at 0, obfuscated at 0, and low security risk (0.2).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code relies on external inputs (proxy URLs, hostnames) which, if malicious, could lead to data leakage or misuse.\n- No actual vulnerabilities, exploits, or malicious behaviors are evident in the code.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or mistakes are apparent.\n- Exception handling is appropriate.\n- Proxy URL parsing is standard; however, it assumes the URL is well-formed, which is typical but could be improved with more validation (not a security flaw per se).\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware score (0):** Consistent with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score (~0.2):** Slightly elevated due to reliance on untrusted input, but overall low.\n\n**Suggestion:** The risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable; no change needed.\n\n### Justification for High Risk Scores (>0.5):\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- Given the code's function, the main concern is data leakage via untrusted URLs, but this is inherent to proxy handling and not malicious.\n\n### Malware and Malicious Behavior:\n- All reports correctly assign malware score 0.\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- The reports assume the external library `{LIB_NAME}` and its proxy socket wrappers are trustworthy. Without inspecting those, we cannot fully rule out malicious behavior, but based on the provided code, no malicious activity is evident.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n**Risk score:** 0.2 — due to reliance on untrusted URLs, but this is standard in proxy configurations.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code appears safe and legitimate.\n- No supply chain sabotage or malicious intent is evident.\n- The only potential concern is the handling of untrusted input, which is typical in proxy code but should be used with caution.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured implementation for asynchronous SOCKS proxy connections. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The risk is minimal and primarily depends on input trustworthiness.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain issues.",
