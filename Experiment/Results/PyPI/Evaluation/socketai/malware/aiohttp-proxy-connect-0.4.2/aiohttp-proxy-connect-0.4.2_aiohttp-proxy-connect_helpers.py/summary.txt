  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, legitimate implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified by the handling of untrusted URLs, which is standard in proxy configurations. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent."
