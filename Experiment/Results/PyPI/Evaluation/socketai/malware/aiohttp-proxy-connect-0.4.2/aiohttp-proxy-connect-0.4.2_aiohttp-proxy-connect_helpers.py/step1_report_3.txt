  "purpose": "Provides functions to create and manage SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously, including parsing proxy URLs and establishing connections via SOCKS proxies.",
  "sources": "parse_proxy_url function reads the raw proxy URL; open_connection and create_connection functions read host, port, and proxy configuration; user input can be passed via parameters.",
  "sinks": "Connections are established via socket wrappers and asyncio methods, with untrusted proxy URLs parsed and used to route traffic.",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url extracts proxy configuration from untrusted URLs; open_connection and create_connection use this data to create and connect socket wrappers; socket data flows through these wrappers into asyncio connection methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Proxy URL parsing includes unquote, but this is standard; no suspicious dynamic code or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard asynchronous connection setup with proxy support, using external libraries for URL parsing and socket management. Proxy URL parsing is straightforward, with proper error handling for missing or malformed components. Connection functions utilize asyncio's event loop and socket wrappers without any suspicious or malicious actions. No code injection, data leakage, or hidden network activity is evident. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on external proxy libraries and asyncio for network operations, which are common and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections in an asynchronous Python environment. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The code's purpose aligns with legitimate proxy connection management without any suspicious or harmful logic.",
