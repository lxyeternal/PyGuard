{
  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous functions to establish SOCKS proxy connections, parse proxy URLs, and create socket wrappers for network communication.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parsing, user-provided host and port, external socket wrapper classes, asyncio event loop, and optional proxy URL input.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted proxy URLs and host/port inputs that could lead to data leakage or connection to malicious proxies.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL parsing → creation of socket wrapper → connection establishment via sock.connect or loop.create_connection → data flow through socket.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. Proper validation and exception handling are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for asynchronous SOCKS proxy connections. It parses proxy URLs, creates socket wrappers for SOCKS4/SOCKS5, and manages connections with validation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The main concern is reliance on untrusted URLs, which could leak credentials or redirect traffic, but this is typical in proxy handling. Exception handling and input validation are appropriate. External dependencies are assumed trustworthy. Overall, the code appears legitimate and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, legitimate implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified by the handling of untrusted URLs, which is standard in proxy configurations. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent.",
