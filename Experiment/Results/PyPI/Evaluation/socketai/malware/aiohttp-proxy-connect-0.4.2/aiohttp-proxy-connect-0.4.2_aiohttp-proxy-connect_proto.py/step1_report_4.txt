{
  "purpose": "The code provides asynchronous wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections, enabling clients to connect via proxy servers with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user-supplied hostnames, port numbers, and optional credentials; DNS resolution via getaddrinfo; data received from proxy servers during negotiation.",
  "sinks": "Data sent to the proxy servers via _send method; data received from proxy servers via _receive method; socket connection establishment and negotiation processes.",
  "flows": "Host and port information from user input → DNS resolution → proxy connection establishment → SOCKS negotiation → authenticated connection to target server.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flows detected. The code properly manages socket connections and handles errors; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard asynchronous SOCKS proxy client functionality, including address resolution, connection establishment, and optional authentication. Error handling aligns with expected network and protocol errors. No indicators of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command injection, or hidden backdoors, are present. Use of standard libraries and conventional patterns suggests legitimate purpose. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious external communications are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy clients without malicious intent. It handles network connections securely and correctly, with proper error handling. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
