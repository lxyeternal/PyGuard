  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements asynchronous SOCKS proxy wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with proper error handling, address resolution, and no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code aligns with standard proxy client implementations.\n- No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- The security risk score of 0.2 seems slightly conservative given the absence of vulnerabilities, but considering the handling of credentials and network data, a low risk score is reasonable.\n- Malware score is appropriately zero.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard implementation, no malicious patterns, and proper handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent with the first report.\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The risk score remains appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid assessment; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Asynchronous SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy classes, standard handling, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is consistent with typical proxy client implementations.\n- No hidden malicious intent or suspicious patterns.\n- The score aligns with the findings.\n\n**Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements SOCKS proxy wrappers, with proper address resolution, connection, and error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Slightly lower securityRisk score (0.1) reflects the absence of any sensitive data handling concerns.\n- All findings are consistent with a benign implementation.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate; no adjustment necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy handling, no malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is consistent; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n- The security risk score is reasonable given the context.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues with the report's evaluation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports agree the code is a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; justified by the absence of malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is appropriate given the handling of credentials and network operations, but no critical vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code performs expected proxy client functions with proper error handling.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1 – 0.2 (consistent with the reports)  \n\n**In conclusion:** The reports are accurate and well-justified. No modifications are necessary.",
