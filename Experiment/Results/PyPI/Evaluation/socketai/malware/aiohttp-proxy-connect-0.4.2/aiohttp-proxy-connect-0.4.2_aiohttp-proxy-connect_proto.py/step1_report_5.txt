{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes for handling proxy socket connections (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5) with asynchronous support, including connection negotiation, authentication, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads include input parameters like host, port, username, password; socket operations for connecting, sending, and receiving data; address resolution via getaddrinfo.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include socket send/recv functions, data sent for authentication, and address resolution data that could be misused if misconfigured.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to socket operations, through authentication and connection negotiation, including address resolution and request sending.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for proxy handling; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are evident. No hidden network connections or data exfiltration routines are present. Error handling is typical for socket operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard asynchronous SOCKS proxy connection handling, including address resolution, connection setup, authentication, and error handling. It does not include any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activities. The usage of exceptions and error codes aligns with typical proxy implementations. No obfuscation or malicious behaviors such as data theft, hidden backdoors, or system sabotage are detected. The code functions as a proxy client wrapper, and all functions serve legitimate proxy connection purposes. No signs of supply chain attack or malicious code insertion are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy socket handling with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It follows standard patterns and handles errors appropriately. No malicious behaviors or supply chain sabotage are evident.",
