  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements asynchronous SOCKS proxy wrappers (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5). No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard, with no signs of malicious activity. The low security risk score seems appropriate, considering the code handles proxy connections and credentials securely without hardcoded secrets.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard implementation and no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous report; the code is typical for SOCKS proxy clients, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SOCKS proxy implementation, with proper handling of address resolution, authentication, and socket management.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The credential parameters are typical, not malicious.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard SOCKS proxy client code, with no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower security risk score (0.1), which aligns with the absence of sensitive hardcoded secrets or suspicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy client implementation, no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The code is legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code being a standard proxy client implementation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Mostly 0.2, with one at 0.1, reflecting low but not negligible security concerns (e.g., handling of credentials). These are reasonable given the code's functionality.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** Confirmed as 0 across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports; no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose and implementation, a risk score around 0.1–0.2 is appropriate. No evidence suggests higher risk.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, considering credential handling and protocol adherence.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code, and a low security risk score.\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed based on this review.",
