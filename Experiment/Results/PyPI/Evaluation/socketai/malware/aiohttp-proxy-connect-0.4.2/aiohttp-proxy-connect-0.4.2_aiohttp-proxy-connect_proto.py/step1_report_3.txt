{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions to establish SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections asynchronously, supporting different authentication methods and address resolutions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from socket responses (_receive, sock_recv), address resolution via getaddrinfo, and parameters such as host, port, username, and password.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over socket (_send, sock_sendall), potentially untrusted data like hostnames and user credentials, and reads socket responses, including authentication and address info.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) → address resolution → SOCKS handshake (auth, connect) → socket data transmission and reception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No obfuscated code patterns or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. The code handles socket connections securely and correctly manages socket closure upon errors. No signs of malicious data exfiltration or backdoors. The code appears consistent with standard proxy connection handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements asynchronous SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client classes with proper handling of socket creation, address resolution, and protocol-specific handshake procedures. It uses exception handling to manage connection errors and socket issues. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are evident. The presence of credential parameters (username, password) is typical for authentication but does not indicate malicious intent. The logic follows standard proxy connection protocols without any signs of malicious activity. The code appears well-structured and intended for legitimate proxy communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It handles network connections securely, with proper error management. There are no signs of supply chain sabotage or malicious data exfiltration. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured component for proxy connections.",
