{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS proxy client wrappers (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5) for network connections, allowing applications to connect through proxies.",
  "sources": "Data is read from network sockets using sock_recv and getaddrinfo for hostname resolution. Inputs include hostnames, ports, credentials, and data to send.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into socket send operations, hostname resolution, and authentication requests. Data sent over sockets could include user credentials or sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Hostname resolution and user credentials flow into socket communication; data from user input (host, port, credentials) flow into socket connect and authentication procedures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated or unusual code constructs. Error messages include detailed strings, but no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are observed. Error handling is standard. No network connections to suspicious domains or hidden backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers, handling both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols with standard authentication and connection negotiation. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The functions perform hostname resolution, socket management, and proxy negotiation in a typical manner. Error messages and exception handling are standard and do not reveal sensitive info. The code relies on existing libraries and performs no malicious actions like data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden network communications. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It handles proxy negotiation securely without hardcoded secrets or backdoors. There is no evidence of malicious activities or supply chain sabotage within this code fragment.",
