  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate implementation of asynchronous SOCKS proxy wrappers (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5). No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is standard, with proper error handling and no signs of malicious intent. The risk score is low, reflecting typical proxy client behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** The score seems reasonable. No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is standard SOCKS proxy wrappers, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The low risk score aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Conclusion:** The scoring appears appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** The code implements asynchronous SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 clients, with proper handling and no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is thorough; no backdoors or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy client implementation, with no suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower risk score, which is reasonable given the standard implementation.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard implementation with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with other reports; no issues detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0.2, with one at 0.1, reflecting low security risk typical of proxy client code.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** Given the thoroughness and the low scores, I would assign a slightly higher but still low risk score, around **0.15-0.2**, considering the potential for misuse if misconfigured but nothing malicious in the code itself.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are consistent and well-reasoned.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No modifications necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware=0, obfuscated=0.\n- Slightly adjust risk to around **0.15** for a conservative estimate, but 0.2 remains reasonable.\n\n**Note:** No signs of supply chain sabotage or malicious intent are evident in this code segment.",
