  "purpose": "Implementation of asynchronous SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers with proper error handling, address resolution, and negotiation protocols.",
  "sources": "Hostnames, IP addresses, credentials (user_id, username, password), socket data streams, DNS resolution functions.",
  "sinks": "Network socket connections, data sent over sockets, address resolution outputs, authentication responses.",
  "flows": "Input hostnames/IPs and credentials → DNS resolution or IP conversion → SOCKS negotiation and authentication → proxy connection establishment → data transmission over established socket.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Proper error handling and protocol adherence observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients using asyncio, with appropriate error handling, address resolution, and authentication. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The security considerations are typical for proxy clients, with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SOCKS proxy client implementation with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The low security risk scores are justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
