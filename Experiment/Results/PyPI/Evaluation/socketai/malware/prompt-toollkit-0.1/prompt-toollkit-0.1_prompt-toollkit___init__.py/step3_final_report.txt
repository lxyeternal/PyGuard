  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input variables, environment variables, potential network or file operations, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, system calls, output streams.",
  "flows": "Input data from sources to sinks through processing functions; potential data exfiltration or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no malicious indicators. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of suspicious activity. Security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern given the limited context. Confidence levels are high where code is present, and zero where no code exists, which is appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippets and assessments suggest no malicious activity or security threats. The scoring is consistent and justified. No adjustments are necessary; the supply chain security appears minimal.",
