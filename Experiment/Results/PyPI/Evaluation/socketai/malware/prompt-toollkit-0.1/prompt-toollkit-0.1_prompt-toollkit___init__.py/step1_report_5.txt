  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python script or package designed for general functionality, possibly including data processing or utility functions. Specific intent cannot be determined without examining actual code content.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, user input functions, or external files. Specific data sources are not detailed due to the absence of code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, system commands, or data output functions. Precise locations cannot be identified without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input, environment variables, files) to sinks (network, files, system commands). Without specific code, exact paths cannot be mapped.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are evident based solely on the provided empty input.",
  "analysis": "The input provided contains no actual code to analyze. Therefore, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security issues can be identified without code content.",
  "conclusion": "No code was provided for review. Based on the absence of code, there are no detectable security risks or malicious behaviors. If code is supplied, a thorough review should follow.",
