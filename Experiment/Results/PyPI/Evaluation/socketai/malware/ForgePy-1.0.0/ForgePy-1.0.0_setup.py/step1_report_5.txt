{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the ForgePy Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "User input for package metadata, such as name, version, author, email, and install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data or potentially dangerous functions invoked.",
  "flows": "Data flows from metadata fields (e.g., author_email, description) to package setup; no dynamic data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Empty URL and license fields; description repeats email, which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies, which is standard practice. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident. The use of cryptography as a dependency appears legitimate. The lack of URLs or license info is unconventional but not suspicious. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical packaging standards.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and standard for Python packaging. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are identified based on this code.",
