  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the ForgePy Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Constants and string literals defining package metadata, the 'install_requires' list specifying dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Description field contains an email address instead of descriptive text, which may be unintended but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no external data inputs, and no suspicious or malicious instructions. The email address in the description field might be a placeholder or misused field but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
