{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the ForgePy Python package, used to package and distribute the module.",
  "sources": "Input data includes package metadata (name, version, author, email, description) and required dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no code execution or data leakage points evident.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from sources to sinks; the script primarily defines package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets are minimal (e.g., author email), but this is typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup configuration, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated elements. The only potential concern is the hardcoded email addresses, but these are typical in package metadata. The install_requires specifies a fixed cryptography version, which is standard practice. No malicious behavior or suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a typical package setup configuration with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies, with no harmful code present.",
