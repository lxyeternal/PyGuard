  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields: name, version, author, author_email, description, url, license; install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "No external data input or output; no dynamic code execution; no untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "N/A - all data is static and predefined; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The description field contains an email address instead of descriptive text; author_email also contains an email; url and license fields are empty. These are unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static metadata and a fixed dependency. No dynamic or external inputs are present. The only unusual aspect is the use of email addresses in metadata fields, which suggests placeholder or misused fields rather than malicious intent. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected. The malware score is zero, as there are no malicious actions. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), primarily due to incomplete or placeholder metadata, not security vulnerabilities. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor anomalies are metadata placeholders and do not pose security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
