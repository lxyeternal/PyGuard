{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the ForgePy Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data for package metadata, such as name, version, author, description, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; the code only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the script simply specifies static package info and requirements.",
  "anomalies": "The email address is duplicated as both description and author_email, which is unusual but not malicious. The url and license fields are empty, which might indicate incomplete info but not malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script defining package metadata and dependencies. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or anomalies. It does not perform any operations beyond configuration. The use of cryptography library is typical for packages that require cryptographic functions, with no misuse observed.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, serving only to configure package distribution. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from the code provided.",
