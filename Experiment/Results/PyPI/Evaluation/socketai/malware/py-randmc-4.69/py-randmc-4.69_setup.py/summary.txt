  "conclusion": "The code contains a heavily obfuscated, hidden PowerShell payload executed during setup, with suspicious URL and silent error handling. These signs strongly indicate malicious intent, such as remote code execution or data exfiltration. The high malware and risk scores are justified. It is recommended to treat this package as malicious or compromised, and further decoding of the payload is advised to confirm its purpose."
