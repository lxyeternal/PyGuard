      "conclusion": "The analyzed code contains highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payloads that connect to external domains, indicating malicious intent. The setup code itself appears benign but is used as a cover for malicious activity. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores across reports are justified and reflect the potential threat."
