  "conclusion": "The code embeds a heavily obfuscated, potentially malicious PowerShell payload executed during package setup, representing a high supply chain security risk. The suspicious obfuscation, hidden execution, and malicious indicators justify assigning high malware and security risk scores. The package should be treated as malicious or compromised until further analysis confirms otherwise."
