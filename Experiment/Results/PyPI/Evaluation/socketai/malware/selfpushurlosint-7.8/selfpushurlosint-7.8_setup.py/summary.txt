  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup, which could facilitate malicious activities such as remote code execution or data theft. The setup code itself is standard, but the hidden payload and external URL indicate malicious intent. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified. Immediate caution and further decoding of the payload are recommended."
