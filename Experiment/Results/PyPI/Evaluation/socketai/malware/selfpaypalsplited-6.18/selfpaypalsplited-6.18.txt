      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The external URL and silent execution further confirm high security risk. The package should be treated as compromised, and further decoding of the payload is recommended to understand its full impact."
