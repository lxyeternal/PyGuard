{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup script for a Python package named 'selfpaypalsplited', including package metadata and an attempt to execute a PowerShell command potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, filesystem checks (os.path.exists), and executes a subprocess with a PowerShell command encoded in Base64.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command with hidden window style, which could be used to run malicious payloads or exfiltrate data without user awareness.",
  "flows": "The filesystem check triggers the subprocess execution; the command is likely encoded payload that executes in the background, potentially for malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded in Base64, which is suspicious as it often indicates obfuscated or malicious code. The command appears to download and execute external content from a suspicious domain (esquelasquad.rip). The code also silently ignores exceptions, which may hide errors or malicious failures. The use of a hardcoded URL and encoded command is highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities for packaging, but notably, it contains a conditional that, if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist, executes a PowerShell command encoded in Base64. The command's URL points to a suspicious domain, and executing such code could allow remote code execution or data exfiltration. The try-except blocks suppress errors, potentially hiding malicious activity. The package metadata itself appears legitimate, but the embedded code is highly suspicious due to obfuscation, URL, and hidden execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior via obfuscated PowerShell command execution that likely downloads or runs malicious content from an external source. The setup script's apparent purpose is to mask malicious activity during installation or execution, indicating a supply chain attack risk.",
