{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package named 'selfpaypalsplited' with specified metadata, possibly for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads system environment (via os.path.exists), executes a subprocess with encoded PowerShell command, and defines package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess potentially executes malicious code encoded in the PowerShell command, which may perform unwanted actions on the host system.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code runs the PowerShell encoded command, which could execute malicious payloads. The setup function simply registers package info.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a suspicious PowerShell command with an encoded payload that is executed without validation. The code to execute the payload is hidden and obfuscated via Base64 encoding.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup from distutils, then attempts to import subprocess and os. It checks for a directory 'tahg'; if missing, it runs a PowerShell command encoded in base64, likely malicious. The setup call defines package metadata, seemingly benign. The subprocess call is executed with 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' to hide the process window, indicating an attempt to conceal activity. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, potentially hiding failures or malicious activity. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to a script that could perform harmful actions or remote code execution. The overall structure suggests malicious intent aimed at executing hidden code during package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious PowerShell command that is encoded and executed conditionally, indicating malicious behavior. The setup process appears legitimate but is likely used to mask malicious code execution during package installation. The script's intent seems to include remote code execution or system compromise.",
