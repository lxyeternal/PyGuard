  "purpose": "Detects and analyzes obfuscated PowerShell code executed during package setup, indicating potential malicious activity or backdoor behavior.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess call executing encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers conditional execution; if 'tahg' absent, encoded command runs silently.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded, obfuscated PowerShell command; silent exception handling; execution during setup; suspicious comment referencing malicious domain.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a filesystem check and, if the directory 'tahg' does not exist, executes an encoded PowerShell command with hidden window flags. The command is obfuscated, making its purpose unclear, but such patterns are typical in malicious scripts aiming to conceal payloads. Silent exception handling further hides errors, increasing suspicion. Multiple reports recognize this pattern, assigning high malware (0.8), obfuscation (0.85), and security risk (0.85) scores, which are consistent with the observed behavior. The presence of a suspicious domain comment and the encoded payload strongly suggest malicious intent, likely a backdoor or remote code execution vector. Without decoding the payload, certainty is limited, but the pattern aligns with supply chain malware tactics.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, leveraging obfuscation and covert execution during setup. The silent error handling and encoded payload are red flags. Scores assigned across reports are justified and indicate a high security threat. The package should be treated as malicious until further payload analysis confirms benign intent.",
