      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, leveraging obfuscation and covert execution during setup. The silent error handling and encoded payload are red flags. Scores assigned across reports are justified and indicate a high security threat. The package should be treated as malicious until further payload analysis confirms benign intent."
