  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'websockte-client' with version 0.1.",
  "sources": "Input from sys.argv[1], environment variables via os.getenv, and file system operations (os.makedirs, os.path.exists, os.path.basename, os.path.expanduser, os.path.isfile, os.path.isdir, os.remove, os.rmdir, os.mkdir, os.getcwd, os.path.join, os.path.abspath, os.path.basename, os.path.exists, os.path.expanduser, os.path.isfile, os.path.isdir, os.remove, os.rmdir, os.mkdir, os.getcwd, os.path.join, os.path.abspath), and dynamic code execution via 'Dispatch' and 'CreateShortcut'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous operations include writing to files (write, Save, CreateShortcut), removing files/directories (os.remove, os.rmdir), creating shortcuts, and invoking shell operations (Dispatch). Additionally, environment variables are accessed, which could leak sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Input data from command line arguments, environment variables, and file system operations flow into code that performs file manipulations, shortcut creation, and potentially malicious file operations. The code also makes decisions based on obfuscated numeric comparisons, which influence whether dangerous operations like file deletion or shortcut creation occur.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated calculations to determine control flow and variable names that appear as meaningless unicode characters. Complex and convoluted dynamic code (e.g., using 'Dispatch', 'CreateShortcut', and 'os' functions) with heavily obscured logic. Extensive use of encoded strings and dynamic attribute access. The presence of large conditional branches and complex, convoluted number calculations suggest attempts to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code contains highly obfuscated logic with complex dynamic string manipulations involving 'getattr' and 'map' functions on built-in functions like 'oct', 'hex', 'copyright'. It performs conditional logic based on convoluted numeric calculations, leading to potentially dangerous file operations such as creating shortcuts, deleting files, or manipulating filesystem paths. The presence of 'Dispatch' from 'win32com.client' and 'CreateShortcut' hints at possible automation or backdoor activities. The code's flow heavily relies on obscure, intentionally confusing calculations and nested loops, making it difficult to analyze at first glance. The commands to 'write', 'Save', 'CreateShortcut' and filesystem manipulations in certain branches can be malicious if triggered, especially if the environment is malicious or if used to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary commands. Additionally, the code appears to import 'ctypes' and 'os' conditionally, with specific checks for admin rights, which indicates potential privilege escalation or system modification activities. The code also accesses environment variables with 'os.getenv', which could leak sensitive data. The overall structure suggests an intent to obfuscate malicious operations or hidden behaviors disguised as benign setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits heavy obfuscation and complex dynamic code execution techniques designed to hide its true intent. It contains multiple suspicious operations such as file deletion, shortcut creation, filesystem traversal, and environment variable access. The presence of 'win32com' and 'ctypes' operations for system-level interactions indicates potential malicious activity, including privilege escalation or system modification. Due to the obfuscated nature and the operations that can be malicious, the package should not be trusted or used without further detailed analysis. The overall security risk is high, and the malware possibility is likely.",
