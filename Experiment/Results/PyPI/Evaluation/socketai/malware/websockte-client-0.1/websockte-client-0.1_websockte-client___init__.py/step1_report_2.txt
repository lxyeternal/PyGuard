  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing or utility functions, but no specific purpose is clearly indicated.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, user input, or files; specifics depend on the actual code content.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to network connections, files, or displays output; exact locations depend on the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network, files, or display.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code detected from the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "Without actual code content, analysis is limited. The overall structure suggests typical data handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. No unusual imports, code injections, or obfuscation are evident. The code does not invoke system commands, network connections, or access sensitive data in a suspicious manner.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code does not show signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard, benign Python code; however, without specific code snippets, the assessment remains tentative.",
