{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing, potentially involving user input and external data retrieval, but the exact purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Reads data from user input, environment variables, or external files; possibly from network requests if present.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, displays output, or sends data over the network; may include database interactions or subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like output or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation detected. Unusual variable names or complex dynamic code execution are absent.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with standard Python constructs. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical. No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or unsafe operations are detected. The code's structure suggests normal functionality, but due to the absence of detailed context or external calls, some uncertainties remain.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign with no malicious intent identified.",
