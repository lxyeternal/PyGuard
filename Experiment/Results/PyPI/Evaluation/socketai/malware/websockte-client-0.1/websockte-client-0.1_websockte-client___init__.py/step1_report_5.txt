  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python package module potentially intended for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, input parameters, or external files (if any are present). Specific source points are not clearly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or database operations if present; however, these are not explicitly identified in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network or file system operations. Exact paths cannot be confirmed due to the lack of detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are immediately evident. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic execution is apparent. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet appears to be a standard Python module with conventional structure. It does not show signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of third-party libraries is minimal and typical. Without additional context or external dependencies, no suspicious behavior or security risks are evident. There are no hardcoded secrets, and the logic does not involve unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not demonstrate malicious intent or security risks. It seems to be a benign, well-structured Python module. However, due to the limited code provided, a low confidence level is assigned regarding its complete security posture.",
  "confidence": 0.4,
