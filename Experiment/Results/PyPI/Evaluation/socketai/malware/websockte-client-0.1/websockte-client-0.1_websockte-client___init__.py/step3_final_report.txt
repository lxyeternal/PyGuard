{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module with no signs of malicious activity, primarily serving data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input data is likely read from function parameters, environment variables, or standard input, but no explicit sources are identified in the provided context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication, file writing, or system commands if present, but no suspicious or untrusted data flows are detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to sinks such as network or file operations, but no dangerous flows are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious imports are detected; code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is either absent or minimal, limiting detailed analysis. Based on the available information, it shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The confidence in this assessment is high due to the lack of suspicious patterns. No malicious code, backdoors, or unsafe operations are evident. The overall security risk is low, given the benign nature of the code and absence of anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating a low threat level. Continued monitoring and static analysis are recommended if code complexity increases.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
