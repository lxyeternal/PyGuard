  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "eval/exec usage, network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated variables, input handling, code structure",
  "sinks": "network communication functions, file operations, environment variable access, data exfiltration points",
  "flows": "source indicators (eval/exec, network calls) leading to potential data leaks or malicious actions",
  "anomalies": "obfuscation, use of eval/exec on untrusted data, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, minimal or empty code",
  "analysis": "The reports consistently identify eval/exec and obfuscation as key suspicious behaviors. Report 1 indicates high suspicion with scores of 0.6 malware, 0.7 obfuscated, and 0.75 security risk, justified by behavioral indicators. Reports 2-5 lack code or show benign patterns, with low scores. The scores align with the described behaviors, with Report 1 warranting close scrutiny. The overall assessment supports a malware score around 0.6, obfuscation near 0.7, and risk approximately 0.75, reflecting the suspicion level in Report 1. No concrete malicious code is confirmed, so scores are based on behavioral suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are consistent with their assessments. Report 1's high suspicion scores are justified if the code contains eval/exec and obfuscation. Other reports correctly indicate benign or absent code. The overall security risk remains moderate, primarily driven by Report 1's indicators.",
