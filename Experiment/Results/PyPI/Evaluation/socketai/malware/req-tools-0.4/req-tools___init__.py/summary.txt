  "conclusion": "The provided reports are consistent with their assessments. Report 1's high suspicion scores are justified if the code contains eval/exec and obfuscation. Other reports correctly indicate benign or absent code. The overall security risk remains moderate, primarily driven by Report 1's indicators."
