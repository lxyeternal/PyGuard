  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for 'req-tools' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, packages, install_requires, version, license.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Package name contains a hyphen ('req-tools'), which may cause packaging or import issues but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static configuration data. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data sinks are present. Dependencies are common Windows and GUI automation packages. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are identified. The hyphen in the package name is a minor naming concern but not a security issue. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1), which are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned are justified and consistent with the analysis. The minor naming concern does not impact security. Overall, the package is safe.",
