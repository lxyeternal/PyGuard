  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, with static configuration data.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data sinks are present.\n- The dependencies listed are common for Windows automation and GUI tasks.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The package name 'req-tools' with a hyphen might cause packaging issues but isn't malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The only minor technical issue is the use of a hyphen in the package name `'req-tools'`. In Python package naming conventions, hyphens are generally discouraged because they can cause issues with import statements (which use underscores). However, this is a packaging concern, not a security issue.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the static, clear code.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign very low (0.1 or 0), which is reasonable.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nThe scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since there's no malicious code, no malware, and no obfuscation, scores should remain at 0 for malware and obfuscated.\n- The minimal security risk score (around 0.1) reflects the dependency on Windows-specific packages, which could be misused, but in this context, the risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or 0, if you consider the dependencies benign)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The only technical note is the package name formatting, which could be improved for compatibility but does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No malicious code or malware detected.\n- No obfuscation present.\n- Security risk is minimal and justified at a very low level.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep malware and obfuscated scores at 0, with a very low security risk score (0.1).",
