  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'req-tools' Python package, specifying dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package name, packages list, dependencies, version, and license.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of package name 'req-tools' with a hyphen, which may cause issues, but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved. The dependencies include 'pywin32', 'pyscreeze', 'pynput', and 'WMI', which are common for Windows-related automation and GUI tasks, but could be sensitive if misused. However, in this context, they are only declared as requirements. No malicious or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely specifies package metadata and dependencies. No malware, obfuscation, or security issues are detected.",
