      "conclusion": "The code exhibits strong indicators of malicious intent, executing an obfuscated PowerShell payload silently during package installation, likely for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or backdoor access. The setup process itself appears legitimate, but the background activity is suspicious and potentially dangerous. The package should be treated as malicious until further payload analysis confirms safety."
