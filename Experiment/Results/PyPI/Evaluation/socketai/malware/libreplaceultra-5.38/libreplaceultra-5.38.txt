      "conclusion": "The script embeds a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently, connecting to a known malicious domain. The setup code itself is benign, but the embedded activity warrants high suspicion. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified. The package should be treated as malicious or compromised until further payload analysis confirms safety."
