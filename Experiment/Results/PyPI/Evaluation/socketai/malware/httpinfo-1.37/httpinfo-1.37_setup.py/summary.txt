  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, indicating a high potential for malicious activity. The high obfuscation, stealth execution, and error suppression justify a high malware score (~0.85) and security risk (~0.9). This package should be considered potentially malicious until the payload is decoded and verified safe."
