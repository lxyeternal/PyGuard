      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during setup, indicating likely malicious activity. The use of obfuscation, silent execution, and conditional triggers suggests an attempt to conceal malicious intent or establish a backdoor. The package should be treated as malicious until further payload analysis confirms otherwise."
